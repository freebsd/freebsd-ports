Osmosis is a command line java app for processing OSM data.  The tool consists
of a series of pluggable components that can be chained together to perform a
larger operation.  For example, it has components for reading from database and
from file, components for writing to database and to file, components for
deriving and applying change sets to data sources, components for sorting data,
etc. It has been written so that it is easy to add new features without
re-writing common tasks such as file or database handling.
