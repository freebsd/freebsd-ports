It shows you the solar system viewed from top (90 heliocentric).

The objects have the following colors: 
Sun - yellow      Mercury - green
Venus - white     Earth - cyan
Mars - red        Jupiter - gray
Saturn - green    Uranus - pink
Neptune - cyan    Pluto is not included since it's way "off course"

A left click on the window changes the view between inner and outer
planets. A left click on the date increases the day/month/year. A
right click on the date does the opposite. Click the right mouse
button on the solar system to reset the date to the current date
(which is in Universal Time).
