to create an interactive map. The geographic data is from the xearth
root window program. by Kirk Lauritz Johnson in an interactive widget.
xeartk is not part of and does not require xearth. It only uses the
outline data defined in file mapdata.c of the xearth source
distribution. The cities are from factmonster.

Adjust the map view by Shift-Double-Clicking or Shift-Dragging. Double
click a dot to display information about the city there on the terminal.
