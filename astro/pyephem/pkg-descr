PyEphem provides scientific-grade astronomical computations for the Python
programming language. Given a date and location on the Earth's surface, it can
compute the positions of the Sun and Moon, of the planets and their moons, and
of any asteroids, comets, or earth satellites whose orbital elements the user
can provide. Additional functions are provided to compute the angular
separation between two objects in the sky, to determine the constellation in
which an object lies, and to find the times at which an object rises, transits,
and sets on a particular day.
