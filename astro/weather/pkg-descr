This command-line utility is intended to provide quick access to current
weather conditions and forecasts. Presently, it is capable of returning data
for localities throughout the USA by retrieving and formatting decoded METARs
(Meteorological Aerodrome Reports) from NOAA (the USA National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration) and forecasts from NWS (the USA National Weather
Service). The tool is written to function in the same spirit as other command-
line informational utilities like cal(1), calendar(1) and dict(1). It can
retrieve arbitrary weather data via specific command-line switches (station
ID, city, state), or aliases can be configured system wide and on a per-user
basis. It can be freely used and redistributed under the terms of a BSD-like
License.
