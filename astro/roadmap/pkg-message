RoadMap is at an early stage of development, and is not thoroughly
documented.  It would be very unwise to rely on RoadMap for real
navigation.

The instructions for downloading and installing the necessary
TIGER data are located in:

     %%DOCSDIR%%/README

Make sure that you either have a program called flite (a voice synthesizer)
or disable (mute) audio throught the menu. Other voice synthesizer can 
be used, like festival
