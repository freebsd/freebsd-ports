Siril is an astronomical image processing tool, able to convert, pre-process
images, help aligning them automatically or manually, stack them and enhance
final images.

Siril is targeted to amateur astronomers having acquired images and wanting
to process them in a semi-automatic way. It provides a more user-friendly
interface than Iris' command line as well as more modern and powerful processing
algorithms, but it is not yet as automated as DeepSkyStacker or Registax. It
also provides a basic command line to access various processing functions.
