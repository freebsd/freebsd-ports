This program generates, but does not display, image files containing 
raster maps of the Earth.  It includes public-domain, vector
data from which they are drawn, describing the continents, bodies
of water, boundaries of countries and U.S. states, and a few cities.
Command-line options allow centering the maps at a particular
latitude and longitude and zooming in.
