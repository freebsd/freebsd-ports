astLib is a set of Python modules that provides some tools for research
astronomers. It can be used for astronomical plots, some statistics,
common calculations, coordinate conversions, and manipulating FITS images
with World Coordinate System (WCS) information through PyWCSTools - a
simple wrapping of WCSTools by Doug Mink. PyWCSTools is distributed (and
developed) as part of astLib.
