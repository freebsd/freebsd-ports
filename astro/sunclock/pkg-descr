Sunclock is an X11 application that displays a map of the Earth and
shows the illuminated portion of the globe. In addition to providing
local time for the default timezone, it also displays GMT time,
legal and solar time of major cities, their latitude and longitude,
the mutual distances of arbitrary locations on Earth, the position
at zenith of Sun and Moon. Sunclock can display meridians, parallels,
tropics and arctic circles. It has builtin functions that accelerate
the speed of time and show the evolution of seasons. Sunclock can
be internationalized for various western languages. It is possible
to customize the app-default file and enter additional city entries.

Sunclock can commute between two states, the "clock window" and the
"map window". The clock window displays a small map of the Earth
and therefore occupies little space on the screen, while the "map
window" displays a large map and offers more advanced functions.
The Sunclock package includes a resizable and zoomable vector map.
External Earth maps can also be loaded.
