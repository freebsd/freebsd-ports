Tkgeomap is an open source set of extensions to the Tcl/Tk scripting
language. It adds commands that read, manipulate, and display geographic
data.

It provides four packages:
* tclgeomap - library written in C adds commands for basic geography
  calculations and data access.
* tclgeomap_procs - library written in Tcl adds procedures that
  supplement tclgeomap.
* tkgeomap - library written in C that adds the ability to draw maps
* tkgeomap_procs - library written in Tcl adds procedures that
  supplement tkgeomap.

This port contains the Tcl part.
