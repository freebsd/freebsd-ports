Astro::PAL provides a Perl interface to either the Starlink PAL positional
astronomy library.

Return values are returned on the stack rather than being modified in place.

In addition small utility subroutines are provided that do useful tasks (from
the author's point of view) - specifically routines for calculating the Local
Sidereal Time.
