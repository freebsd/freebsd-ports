Starlink::AST provides a perl wrapper to the Starlink AST library.
The Starlink AST library provides facilities for transforming coordinates
from one system to another in an object oriented manner. Multiple
coordinate frames can be associated with a data set and it is also
possible to generate automatic mappings between frames.

Coordinate frame objects can be imported from FITS headers and from
NDF files.
