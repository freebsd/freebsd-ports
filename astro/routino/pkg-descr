Routino is an application for finding a route between two points using the
dataset of topographical information collected by http://www.OpenStreetMap.org.

This router uses a routing algorithm that takes OSM format data as its input and
calculates either the shortest or quickest route between two points. To optimise
the routing a custom database format is used. This allows the routing to be
performed quickly after a modest one-off pre-processing stage.
A selection is possible for any of the major OSM transport types and for each of
the main OSM highway types a preference can be provided and a speed limit.
Restrictions on one-way streets, weight, height, width and length are also
options. Further preferences about road properties (e.g. paved or not) can also
be selected.

The processing of the input XML file is based on rules in a configuration file
that transform the highway tags into tags that are understood by Routino. The
generation of the output files (HTML and GPX) uses language fragments selected
from another configuration file which allows multi-lingual output from the same
database.
The router takes into account private/public/permissive restrictions on highways
as well as tagged speed limits and barriers (gates, bollards). The simplest and
most common turn restriction relations (those composed of a way, node and way)
are also supported.
