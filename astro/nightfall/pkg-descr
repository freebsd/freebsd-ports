Nightfall is an astronomy application for fun, education, and science.
It can produce animated views of eclipsing binary stars, calculate
synthetic lightcurves and radial velocity curves, and eventually
determine the best-fit model for a given set of observational data of
an eclipsing binary star system. 
It is, however, not able to fry your breakfast egg on your harddisk ;-)
