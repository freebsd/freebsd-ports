This class implements an application to predict satellite visibility and
related phenomena. It is a mostly-compatible rewrite and eventual
replacement of the satpass script in distribution Astro-satpass, aimed
at making it easier to test, and removing some of the odder cruft that
has accumulated in the satpass script.
