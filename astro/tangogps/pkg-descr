Tangogps is an easy to use, fast and lightweight mapping application for
use with or without GPS. By default tangoGPS uses map data from the
Openstreetmap project. Additionally a variety of other repositories
can be easily added.

The maps are automagically downloaded and cached for offline use while
you drag or zoom the map. Furthermore you can conveniently pre-cache
areas with tangoGPS.
