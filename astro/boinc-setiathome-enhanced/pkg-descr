SETI - Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence -- Enhanced version

Use your unused CPU cycles to aid in computations analyzing radio
telescope information for possible signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence.
The project exclusively uses the enhanced version since 2006-05-17.

The port automatically optimizes for the host CPU using the CPUTYPE
variable in /etc/make.conf

Note that there is currently no screensaver support in this version.

The source archive is a repackaged version of
setiathome_enhanced-client-cvs-2007-08-08.tar.gz at
http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/seti_source/nightly[/old]/ :
* The screensaver and server code is removed
* The configure and Makefile scripts are regenerated to match the
  net/boinc-client port
