WeatherSpect provides a reasonably accurate simulation of what the weather looks
like outside, in ASCII art. It includes rain, snow, lightning, sleet, and hail.
The windspeed and cloudiness are reflected in the velocity and quantity of
clouds. There are trees that age, reproduce and die over the course of an hour,
and a sun and moon that follow the actual sun and moonrise. There's also a
dancing turtle.
