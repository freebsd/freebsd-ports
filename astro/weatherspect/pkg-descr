WeatherSpect provides a reasonably accurate simulation of what the
weather looks like outside, in ASCII art. It includes rain, snow,
lightning, sleet, and hail. The windspeed and cloudiness are reflected
in the velocity and quantity of clouds. There are trees that age,
reproduce and die over the course of an hour, and a sun and moon that
follow the actual sun and moonrise. There's also a dancing turtle.
