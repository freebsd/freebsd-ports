compatible with the EasyWeather application .

The result is a weather history log file that can be uploaded to a central
server for further processing. Example script files for uploads is included.
So far the following formats are supported:
    * Weather Underground
    * pywws
    * XML

fowsr performs a complete read out of the weather station memory using its
USB port, and stores the result in a cache file to speed up later read-outs.
Rain data is then calculated per hour, day, week and month if data for these
periods exist. No further data processing is performed. This makes fowsr
very small and well suited for running in embedded devices at remote
locations.
