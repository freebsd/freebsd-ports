SatTrack is a real-time satellite tracking and orbit propagation
program with an X11 color world map tracking chart.  It provides
two different live displays, for single or multiple satellites,
and two different orbit prediction modes.  The program can be run
from almost any VT100 compatible terminal.  If the program is run
from an X Window terminal, the realtime graphics display can be
started up.  It will show the location of any number of specified
satellites like the Space Shuttle or the Russian Space Station Mir,
featuring the circle of visibility for any selected spacecraft and
for the primary and a number of secondary ground stations.  Also
shown are the ground track for the next three orbits, the black-out
zones for communication through the TDRSS network, Mission Elapsed
Time (MET), the terminator, spacecraft lighting conditions and
other details.  The world maps are provided in two different styles
with four different sizes each.  Program SatTrack is particularly
interesting for the upcoming Shuttle - Mir rendezvous missions.

The much advanced commercial off-the-shelf version of SatTrack
(V4.0) can be obtained from Bester Tracking Systems.
