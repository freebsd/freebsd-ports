This program draws the Solar System's bodies in simulated 3-dimensionality.
You can view all the planets, their moons and a few spaceships in motion,
trace them, follow them, orbit them, and even control them.

OpenUniverse was formerly known as Solar System Simulator (Ssystem). It was
initially released in 1997 with the intent of creating a rotating display of
the Earth on a mainstream PC. Ssystem version 1.0 was only aware of the
planets. Version 1.2 added moons; and 1.6, more means of movement and
better textures.

The program has been renamed OpenUniverse 1.0 to underline the concept
behind its further development: openness for the whole Universe, not just
the solar system - open for anyone to use, extend, and change.
