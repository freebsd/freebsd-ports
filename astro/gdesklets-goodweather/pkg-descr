This desklet (sensor/display) shows the current temperature, humidity, sky,
windchill temperature and a forecast of the next 4 days on your desktop.

The data is retrieved from Weather XML Data Feed project at weather.com.

The desklet is a hack based on the code of the original weather desklet, the
Liquid Weather++ module for Karamba and some very nice artwork.
