Astro::FITS::CFITSIO is a perl interface to William Pence's cfitsio
subroutine library. For more information on cfitsio, see
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio.

This module attempts to provide a wrapper for nearly every cfitsio
routine, while retaining as much cfitsio behavior as possible. As
such, one should be aware that it is still somewhat low-level, in
the sense that handing an array which is not the correct size to a
routine like fits_write_img() may cause SIGSEGVs.
