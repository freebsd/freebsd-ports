ReadOSM is an open source library to extract valid data from within an Open
Street Map input file. Such OSM files come in two different formats:

* files identified by the .osm suffix simply are plain XML files.
* files identified by the .osm.pbf suffix does containt the same identical
data, but adopting the Google's Protocol Buffer serialization format and thus
requiring much less storage space.
