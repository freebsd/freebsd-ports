suck feeds news to local INN or CNEWS server without the remote NNTP feeding.
This is useful, if you get news from NNTP server with dialup connection.

Suck is a program used to grab news from a remote NNTP news server and
bring it to your local machine, without the remote server doing
anything special. If you have read permission on the server, you can
use suck. Suck does NOT use the NEWNEWS command, hated by many
administrators.
