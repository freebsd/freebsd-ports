Twisted News provides a very basic NNTP server, as well as an NNTP client 
protocol implementation. Two message storage systems are supported: the 
DB-API 2.0 backend stores and indexes messages in any compatible SQL database; 
the Twisted dirdbm backend uses serialized Python objects stored directly on 
the filesystem for message storage. Twisted News also has very rudamentary 
support for moderated groups.

Twisted News is available under the MIT Free Software licence.
