POE::Component::Server::NNTP is a POE component that implements an RFC 977
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc977.html NNTP server. It is the companion component
to POE::Component::Client::NNTP which implements NNTP client functionality.

You spawn an NNTP server component, create your POE sessions then register
your session to receive events. Whenever clients connect, disconnect or send
valid NNTP protocol commands you will receive an event and an unique client ID.
You then parse and process the commands given and send back applicable NNTP
responses.

This component doesn't implement the news database and as such is not by itself
a complete NNTP daemon implementation.
