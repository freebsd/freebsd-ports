 3. How do I configure Leafnode+?
 
 See the manual pages for information on how to configure Leafnode+.
-Also, see the sample configuration file, "config.example", in the
-Leafnode+ distribution.

 4. How do I upgrade from Leafnode?
 
 Upgrading is easy - Leafnode+ can be used as a direct replacement for
 Leafnode.  However, Leafnode+ will write some additional files in the
-LIBDIR defined when compiling Leafnode+, usually /usr/lib/leafnode.
-Therefore, the UID under which Leafnode+ runs, usually root or news,
-needs write access to this directory.

 5. Can I use Leafnode+ with multiple news servers?

 Most news reader software uses the NEWGROUPS command to learn about
 the creation of new groups.  The Leafnode+ news server does not
 support this command.  To check if new groups are available, see the
-"groupinfo" file in your LIBDIR (usually /usr/lib/leafnode).

 4. Set up a cron job (as user "news") to run texpire every night or

    I did "crontab -u news -e" as root to edit the crontab file, and

 5. Make sure fetchnews is run at the appropriate time.  If you have a
    full-time link, run it out of cron (as "news" again), if not, run
    it when your connection to the net is established.  If it is run as
