rawdog is an RSS Aggregator Without Delusions Of Grandeur.

Written in Python, it uses Mark Pilgrim's feed parser. It runs from
cron, collects articles from a number of feeds, and generates a
static HTML page listing the newest articles in date order. It
supports per-feed customizable update times, and uses ETags,
Last-Modified, and gzip compression to minimize network bandwidth
usage.

rawdog's output format is similar to that of PyDS and Hep.
