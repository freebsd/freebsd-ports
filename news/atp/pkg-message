Each user who wishes to use ATP must do the following:

1.  set environment variable ATP to the location where s/he
    wishes configuration files located (e.g. ${HOME}/.qwk')

2.  create the directory named above

3.  copy the files in ${PREFIX}/share/atp into it

4.  edit the atprc and taglines.atp file to contain whatever
    data you want.

5.  If you want atp to look good in xterms, you should get and install the
    VGA font, available in the port "emulators/pcemu".  Then run ATP like
    this: "xterm -fn vga -e atp".  Be sure to set "ansi = on", "color = on",
    "charset = msdos", and "graphics = off" in your atprc file!  (You can
    use atp in an xterm even without doing these steps, but you won't get
    the pretty PC ANSI-style graphics characters!)

see the atp(1) man page for more details.
