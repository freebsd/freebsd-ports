yydecode started life as a decoder for yEnc encoded binaries, which have
recently appeared on Usenet. yydecode works almost identically to the infamous
uudecode program. Version 0.2.8 and onwards contains a superset of uudecode's
functionality, (ie. decodes standard uuencoded files, as well as Base64
[RFC2045] encoded files produced by uuencode) and hence can be used as a
drop-in replacement in all circumstances.
