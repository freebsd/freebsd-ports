ubh - the Usenet Binary Harvester - is a GPL'ed Perl console
application which automatically discovers, downloads, and decodes
single-part and multi-part Usenet binaries.  Automatically assembles
multi-part binaries.  Provides searching via Perl regular expression
syntax.  Also provides a pre-selection capability whereby the user
can
interactively choose which binaries to download.  Uses a standard
.newsrc file to control which groups and articles to process.
Runs anywhere Perl runs.  Tested under Unix-based Perl, Active Perl
on Win32 platforms, and Mac OS X.  Requires Net::NNTP and
News::Newsrc
(which itself requires Set::IntSpan), MIME::Parser, MIME::Base64,
IO::Stringy, and MailTools (distribution).
