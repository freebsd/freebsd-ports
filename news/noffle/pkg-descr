Noffle is a Usenet news server optimized for few users and low
speed dial-up connections to the Internet. It acts as a server
to news clients running on the local host, but gets its news
feed by acting as a client to a remote server. Allows reading
news offline with many news clients, even if they do not
support offline reading by themselves.
