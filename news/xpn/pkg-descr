With XPN you can read/write articles on the Usenet with a good MIME
support (better than some well known newsreaders).

XPN can operate with all the most diffuse charset starting from US-ASCII
to UTF-8. When you edit an article XPN automatically chooses the best
charset, however is always possible to override this choice.

There also other useful features like scoring, filtered views,
random tag-lines, external editor support, one-key navigation,
ROT13, spoiler char ...
