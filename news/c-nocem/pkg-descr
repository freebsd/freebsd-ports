                      c-nocem - NoCeM for C News and INN

   This is a program for the easy and efficient application of the NoCeM
   protocol on the news spool. Which means, articles for which a NoCeM
   with "action=hide" is accepted, will be deleted from your news system
   as if they had been cancelled. With the installation described below,
   these will be processed as fast as possible and should work like real
   cancels.

   Unlike the standard implementation of NoCeM, this version is optimized
   for the most common case of "spam cancels". In fact, it can do nothing
   else. It can not be run by a normal user, it does not need or
   manipulate state like .newsrc files, it processes only "hide" actions,
   and that only by actually deleting the articles.

   c-nocem is designed for easy setup and fast run and needs no
   maintenance.

The software is in the public domain.
