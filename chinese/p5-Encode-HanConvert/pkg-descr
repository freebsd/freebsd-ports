This module is an attempt to solve most common problems occured in
Traditional vs. Simplified Chinese conversion, in an efficient,
flexible way, without resorting to external tools or modules.

After installing this module, you'll have two additional encoding
formats: big5-simp maps Big5 into Unicode's Simplified Chinese
(and vice versa), and gbk-trad maps CP936 (better known as GBK)
into Unicode's Traditional Chinese and back.

The module exports various xxx_to_yyy functions by default, where
xxx and yyy are one of big5, gb (i.e. GBK/CP936), simp (simplified
Chinese unicode), or trad (traditional Chinese unicode).
