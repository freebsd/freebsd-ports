Muni finds the Unicode value of the 7773 Chinese characters listed in Matthews'
Chinese-English Dictionary.

You enter the character number found in the dictionary, and it will give
you the corresponding Unicode mapping, or tell you when no such mapping has
been defined.

Rather than just entering the number, you can type in a query, for example:

	% muni
	: What is Unicode mapping for "Yung", listed in Matthews' Dictionary
	: as character 7589?
	- Matthews(7589) = U+6C38
	: Thank you. How about 3268, Matthews' number for "Kang"?
	- Matthews(3268) = U+525B
	: Thank you, Mr. Computer.
