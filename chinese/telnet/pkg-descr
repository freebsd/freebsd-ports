Description:
	Using /usr/bin/telnet in "8-bit environment", for example, BIG5-
encoding Chinese characters environment in Taiwan, is somewhat in-convenient.
	To be able to input Chinese characters, "-8 or -L" options are needed,
however, using these options cause another problem. Specifying "-8 or -L" 
makes ^U or ^C or ^D or ... (any isprint(c)) malfunction when telnet to SunOS.

How-To-Repeat:
	/usr/bin/telnet -8 ms1.hinet.net       (ms1.hinet.net running Solaris)
	login: abcde^U			       (or just press Enter)
	=> the terminal state goes wrong, "reset" is needed to go back
	   to "normal state"

Fix:
Apply the following patch:
gopher://freebsd.csie.nctu.edu.tw/00%2f3%2fA0002063

This make telnet "8-bit clean", being able to input 8-bit data (Chinese
characters) without specifying "-8 or -L" options, and telnet to SunOS 
without trouble.
