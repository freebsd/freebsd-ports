A paginator similar to "more" or "pg", but much more powerful and
speaks Chinese.

Cless is a port of GNU's less version 290 that suports the display of files
written in the Chinese language using the GB (simple) or Big5 (complex)
encodings.  You can switch to reading of normal ASCII text by setting the
environment LESSCHARSET to 'ascii'.

Also, the help can be displayed in either Simple Chinese, Complex Chinese,
or English by setting the LESSHELP environmental variable to the correct
helpfile.  Cless should be run w/in a CXterm or simular terminal emulator
supporting Chinese language encodings.
