mkisofs is effectively a pre-mastering program to generate the iso9660
filesystem - it takes a snapshot of a given directory tree, and generates
a binary image which will correspond to an iso9660 filesystem when written
to a block device.

This port can also generate Big5 filenames on Joliet filesystems.  Use
the -J option to activate it.
