A collection of writing tools (wenju in Chinese pinyin) such as TIM (Table-
based Input Method), text file formatter, etc.  All the tools are based on
Unicode.  Default input tables include Wubi and Pinyin, among others.

This port also provides "wrap" utility which can be used to wrap input text
to specified width.  It correctly takes into account punctuation marks when
breaking words, and that Latin and Chinese characters have different width.
