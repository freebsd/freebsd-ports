CElvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor.  CElvis supports
nearly all of the vi/ex commands, in both visual mode and colon mode.
It also allows displaying and editing of documents using the
Chinese GB (simple) and Big-5 (complex) encodings.

Celvis is based on Elvis version 1.3 by Steve Kirkendall.
