Pine (Program for Internet News & Email) is a tool for reading, sending,
and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically with
novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of "power users" as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols
(e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and runs on Unix and PCs.

Besides Pine this package includes the Pico editor, the Pilot file browser
and also the IMAPv4r1 daemon and POP2/POP3 servers (these daemons are not
built by default).

An optional set of configuration files can be put into /usr/local/etc
to set system wide defaults. Have a look at the documentation installed
in /usr/local/share/doc/pine/ for more details.

Also included in dot.pinerc.pgp.sample are example entries needed to
add to your .pinerc to activate the pgp add on scripts pgpdecode,
pgpencode, and pgpsign.

dot.pinerc.sample is an example configuration file(include PGP support) can be
put into your home directory as .pinerc.
