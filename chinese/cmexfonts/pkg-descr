This package contains the standard Big5+ Chinese Ming 24x24 bitmap font (and
a resized 16x16 bitmap font) by CMEX and DynaLab for the X Window System
(PCF). This is one of the few Big5 or Big5+ Chinese bitmap fonts on the
Internet that is DFSG-compliant. 

The font was designed by DynaLab and released by CMEX as part of the
proposed Big5+ standard documentation. It was then converted to HBF and BDF
format and further modified by Wei-Lun Chao in September 1998.
