The Chewing is an intelligent phonetic input method (Zhuyin/Bopomofo) and is one
of the most popular choices for Traditional Chinese users. Chewing was inspired
by other proprietary intelligent Zhuyin input methods on Microsoft Windows,
namely Wang-Xin by Eten, Microsoft New Zhuyin, and Nature Zhuyin (aka Going).
The Chewing developer maintains the project as a fully open-source effort,
positioning it as a leading libre intelligent phonetic solution among major
operating environments.
