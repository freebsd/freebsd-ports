kcfonts is a suit of chinese Ming Fanti fonts for X-window 

kcfonts' fonts are contributed by Kau Chauo Information CO. to all
TANet users running on PC. Thanks Chin-Hao Tsai <c-tsai@uiuc.edu>, who
converted it to the style of ETen's fonts. Now you can use kcfonts &
crxvt to view Chinese by BIG5 encoding.
