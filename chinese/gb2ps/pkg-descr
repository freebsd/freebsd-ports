GB2PS converts Chinese GB (simple) encoded text to PostScript.

It automatically supports the HZ encoding.  It even allows you to mix
GB and HZ code together.

Examples:
	input:	gb2ps -h
	output:	the usage of GB2PS

	input:	gb2ps cm9203d.gb cm
	output: PS programs cm

	input:	gb2ps -b 3 -e 5 cm9208a.hz cm
	output:	PS program cm from page 3 to page 5.

then you can print out the Chinese document by sending the PS output
to your PS printer.
