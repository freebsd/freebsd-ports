phpBB2 has been installed, but is not quite ready to be used yet!

You have to ensure that you have a database server (or ODBC access to a
remote database) installed and configured, and you have to ensure that your
PHP installation has been compiled with support for your database or
database access method.  You have to create a database for phpBB2 to use,
and ensure that this database may be accessed and changed by the user id
under which your web server executes.  Further information on these
installation procedures may be found in:

  %%DOCSDIR%%/README.html


Once these steps have been taken, you may connect to the following URL to
configure your installation of phpBB2:

  http://%%HOSTNAME%%/%%PHPBB_URL%%

To make phpBB available through your web site, I suggest
that you add something like the following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /%%PHPBB_URL%%/ "%%PREFIX%%/%%PHPBBDIR%%/"

    <Directory "%%PREFIX%%/%%PHPBBDIR%%/">
        Options none
        AllowOverride Limit

        Order Deny,Allow
        Deny from All
        Allow from All
    </Directory>



After configuring phpBB2 and ensuring that it is operational, you **MUST**
delete the following files manually for security purposes:

  # rm -rf %%PREFIX%%/%%PHPBBDIR%%/install


Duplicates of these files have been installed to %%DATADIR%%.
%%DATADIR%%/contrib contains contributed software for phpBB2.
