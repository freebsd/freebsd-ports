Slash -- Slashdot Like Automated Storytelling Homepage -- is the code
that runs Slashdot. More than that, however, Slash is an architecture
for putting together web sites. It comes with functionality for posting
articles, conducting polls, having discussions, and more; but it can be
extended in innumerable ways.

Slash is written in Perl, and is built on top of Apache and mod_perl. It
requires a database backend, though the only well-supported database
used with it is MySQL (more databases will become well-supported as time
goes on; PostgreSQL support is already well on its way). Slash is fast,
scalable, and secure (as evidenced by one of the best test cases you
could have, running Slashdot itself).

Through a plugin system, developers can add functionality to Slash.
Through themes and templates (which are written using Template Toolkit),
the look and feel of a Slash site can be customized.

"Metalist" is the code name of a Traditional Chinese port of Slash, with
added functionalities and plug-ins.
