  What is GTransferManager
  ========================

  GTransferManager allows the user to retrieve multiple files from the
  web. These files can be retrieved in multiple parts and each part
  retrieved on a separate session that the user is connected to the
  Internet. This is most useful to users with dialup connections. The
  program performs this tasks using wget as it's back-end.

  The program now supports CORBA. This makes easy for other programs
  to use GTransferManager to handle the transfer of files from the
  Internet.

  The program has also a applet that communicates with program using
  CORBA. The applet can launch the program, request for a new download
  or accept drops of URLs from netscape and give this URLs to GTM.
