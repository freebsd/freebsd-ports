UFTP is an encrypted multicast file transfer program, designed to securely,
reliably, and efficiently transfer files to multiple receivers simultaneously.
This is useful for distributing large files to a large number of receivers,
and is especially useful for data distribution over a satellite link
(with two way communication), where the inherent delay makes any TCP based
communication highly inefficient.
