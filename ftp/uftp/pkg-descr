UFTP is a multicast file transfer program, utilizing a protocol
based on Starburst MFTP. It is designed to reliably and efficiently
transfer files to multiple receivers simultaneously, where either
the intended receivers can be specified beforehand, or receivers
can join the transfer when it is initiated. This is useful for
distributing large files to a large number of receivers, and is
especially useful for data distribution over a satellite link (with
two way communication), where the inherent delay makes any TCP based
communication terribly inefficient.
