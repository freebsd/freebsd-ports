wush is a command line tool that lets you easily transfer files and
open shells over a peer-to-peer wireguard connection. It's similar to
magic-wormhole but:

 - No requirement to set up or trust a relay server for authentication.

 - Powered by Wireguard for secure, fast, and reliable connections.

 - Automatic peer-to-peer connections over UDP.

 - Endless possibilities; rsync, ssh, etc.
