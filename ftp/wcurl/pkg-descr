wcurl is a simple curl wrapper which lets you use curl to download
files without having to remember any parameters.

Simply call wcurl with a list of URLs you want to download and wcurl
will pick sane defaults.

If you need anything more complex, you can provide any of curl's
supported parameters via the --curl-options option. Just beware that
you likely should be using curl directly if your use case is not
covered.
