The Bftpd file server is designed to be as small and easy to manage as possible,
while providing most of the features you would expect from a file server. On
most home systems, bftpd is ready to work out-of-the-box without requiring any
extra configuration. Production systems can be set up by editing a few lines in
an easy-to-read config file.

Features of bftpd include:
* Easy configuration
* Speed
* Support for most RFC FTP commands
* tar.gz on-the-fly compression/archiving
* Security with chroot without special setup
* No need for files (sh, ls...) in a chroot environment
* Logging to wtmp and to a config file
* PAM support
* Support for site chown/chmod
