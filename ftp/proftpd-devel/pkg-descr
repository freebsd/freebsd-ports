ProFTPD is a highly configurable ftp daemon for unix
and unix-like operating systems. ProFTPD is designed
to be somewhat of a "drop-in" replacement for wu-ftpd
with a configuration format like Apache.

Full online documentation is available at
http://www.proftpd.org/, including a server
configuration directive reference manual.
