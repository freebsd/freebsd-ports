fmirror is a program for mirroring files and directories from a remote FTP
server.
It allows regex-matching for files that are to be included and excluded.
It uses a combination of timestamp, file size, and file permissions to
decide what files to transfer from the FTP server.
The primary goal of fmirror is to use as little memory as possible,
but still be able to do its job efficiently.
