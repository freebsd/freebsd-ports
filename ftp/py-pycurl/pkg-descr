PycURL is a Python interface to libcurl, the multiprotocol file transfer
library. Similarly to the urllib Python module, PycURL can be used to fetch
objects identified by a URL from a Python program. Beyond simple fetches however
PycURL exposes most of the functionality of libcurl, including:

- Speed - libcurl is very fast and PycURL, being a thin wrapper above libcurl,
  is very fast as well. PycURL was benchmarked to be several times faster than
  requests.
- Features including multiple protocol support, SSL, authentication and proxy
  options. PycURL supports most of libcurl's callbacks.
- Multi and share interfaces.
- Sockets used for network operations, permitting integration of PycURL into the
  applications' I/O loop (e.g., using Tornado).
