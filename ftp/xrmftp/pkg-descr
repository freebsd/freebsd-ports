Xrmftp is FTP client for UNIX with graphical interface. Its main features 
in my opinion are: 

* During transfer you can detach from X-server and continue transfer. This
  feature is useful for people who don't have permanent access to X-terminal.
* Upload and download with directory structure.
* You can resume transfer if file was truncated.
* Listings of visited directories are cached. 
* You can 'walk around' directory tree and put files you want to download 
  into buffer and then download them all together. 

On 1st October of 1998 Xrmftp got honorable mention in "Lucent Technologies
Project Prize" competition organized by Lucent Technologies Poland S.A and 
Faculty of Matematics and Informatics.
