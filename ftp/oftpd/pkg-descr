oftpd is designed to be as secure as an anonymous FTP server can possibly be.
It runs as non-root for most of the time, and uses the Unix chroot() command to
hide most of the systems directories from external users - they cannot change
into them even if the server is totally compromised! It contains its own
directory change code, so that it can run efficiently as a threaded server, and
its own directory listing code (most FTP servers execute the system "ls"
command to list files).
