Two command line ftp tools.

ftpcopy is a simple FTP client written to copy files or directories
(recursively) from a FTP server. It's main purpose is to mirror FTP sites which
support the MLSD/MLST commands or which employ the EPLF directory listing
format, although it also supports the traditional listing format (/bin/ls).

ftpls is a FTP client which generates directory listings, either in plain text
or HTML format.

The tools only support passive mode FTP, intentionally.
