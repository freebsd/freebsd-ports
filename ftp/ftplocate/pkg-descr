FtpLocate is a fast FTP search engine written with Perl. It supports 
indexing on multiple FTP servers and generates summaries for them. 

FtpLocate provides the user two types of searching: search by filename
and search by description. Search by filename will group the results 
by FTP servers and display the server nearest to the client first. 
With search by description, a user can find the files he wants without 
knowing the filename. Files with same description will be grouped together.
