puf is a download tool for UNIX-like systems. You may use it to
download single files or to mirror entire servers. It is similar to
GNU wget (and has a partly compatible command line), but has the
ability to do many downloads in parallel. This is very interesting,
if you have a high-bandwidth internet connection.
