This module augments the list of Net::FTP methods with several
methods that automatically descend directory structures for you.
The methods are:

     rget - Retrieve an entire directory tree.
     rput - Send an entire directory tree.
     rdir - Receive an entire directory tree listing.
     rls  - Receive an entire directory tree listing, filenames only.
     rdelete - Remove an entire directory tree.
