Gwget is a download manager for the Gnome Desktop. The main features are:

* Resume: By default, gwget tries to continue any download.
* Notification: Gwget tries to use the Gnome notification area support,
  if available. You can close the main window and gwget runs in the background.
* Recursivity: Gwget detects when you put a html, php, asp or a web page dir in
  the url to download, and ask you to only download certain files (multimedia,
  only the index, and so on).
* Drag & Drop: You can d&d a url to the main gwget window or the notification
  area icon to add a new download.
