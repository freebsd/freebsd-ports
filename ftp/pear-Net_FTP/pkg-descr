Net_FTP allows you to communicate with FTP servers in a more comfortable way
than the native FTP functions of PHP do. The class implements everything nativly
supported by PHP and additionally features like recursive up- and downloading,
dircreation and chmodding. It although implements an observer pattern to allow
for example the view of a progress bar.
