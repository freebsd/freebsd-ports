bbFTP is a file transfer software. It implements its own transfer protocol,
which is optimized for large files (larger than 2GB) and secure as it does not
read the password in a file and encrypts the connection information.  bbFTP
main features are:

    * Encoded username and password at connection
    * SSH and Certificate authentication modules
    * Multi-stream transfer
    * Big windows as defined in RFC1323
    * On-the-fly data compression
    * Automatic retry
    * Customizable time-outs
    * Transfer simulation
    * AFS authentication integration
    * RFIO interface

bbFTP is open-source software, released under the GNU General Public License.
It was written by Gilles Farrache at IN2P3 Computing Center in Lyon, France.
