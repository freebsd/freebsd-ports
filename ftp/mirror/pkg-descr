Mirror is a package written in Perl that uses the ftp protocol to
duplicate a directory hierarchy between the machine it is run on and a
remote host.  It avoids copying files unnecessarily by comparing the
file timestamps and sizes before transfering.  Amongst other things
can optionally compress, gzip, and split files.
