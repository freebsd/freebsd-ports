A FTP daemon that aims to be "very secure"

From the README file:

	vsftpd is an FTP server, or daemon. The "vs" stands for Very
	Secure.  Obviously this is not a guarantee, but a reflection
	that I have written the entire codebase with security in mind,
	and carefully designed the program to be resilient to attack.
