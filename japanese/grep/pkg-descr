This package is multi-byte extented GNU GREP.  It accepts text which
includes multi-byte character code.  Supported multi-byte codes are
2 byte EUC code and/or Shift-JIS code.

Grep searches the named input files (or standard input if no files are
named, or the file name - is given) for lines containing a match to
the given pattern. By default, grep prints the matching lines.
