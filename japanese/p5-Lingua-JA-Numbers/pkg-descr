This module converts Japanese text in UTF-8 (or romaji in ascii) to
number, AND vice versa. Though this pod is in English and all examples are
in romaji to make http://search.cpan.org/ happy, this module does accept
Japanese in UTF-8. Try the code below to see it.

  perl -MLingua::JA::Numbers \
    -e '$y="\x{4e8c}\x{5343}\x{4e94}"; printf "(C) %d Dan Kogai\n", ja2num($y)'

CAVEAT

DO NOT BE CONFUSED WITH Lingua::JA::Number by Mike Schilli. This module is
far more comprehensive. As of 0.03, it even does its to_string() upon
request.
