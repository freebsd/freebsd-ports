XJDIC is an  electronic  Japanese-English  dictionary  program  designed  to 
operate  in  the  X11 window environment.  In particular,  it must run in an 
"xterm" environment which has Japanese language support such as provided  by

displaying entries for key-words entered in English; 

(b)  a  Japanese  to  English  dictionary  (waei  jiten),  searching for and 
displaying entries for keywords  or  phrases  entered  in  Japanese  (kanji, 
hiragana or katakana); 

(c)  a  Japanese-English  Character  dictionary  (kanei  jiten),  capable of 
selecting kanji characters by JIS code, radical, stroke count,  Nelson Index
