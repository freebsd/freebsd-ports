Kinput2 is an input server for X11 applications that want Japanese
text input.

A client that wants kana-kanji conversion service for Japanese text
sends a request to kinput2.  Kinput2 receives the request, does
kana-kanji conversion, and sends the converted text back to the
client.

The port supports Wnn4.  Egg key binding is avairable,
if you run

kinput2 -ccdef ccdef.kinput2.egg
