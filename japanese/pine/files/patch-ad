+ ; FreeBSD os-fbs.ic file for building os-fbs.c.
+ ;
+ ; Boilerplate header.
+ include(header)
+ 
+ ; Can_access function.  Just calls access.  Only one version available.
+ include(canacces)
+ 
+ ; File_size function.  Only one version available.
+ include(filesize)
+ 
+ ; Is_writable_dir function.  Only one version available.
+ include(writ_dir)
+ 
+ ; Create_mail_dir function.  All Unixes use creatdir and DOS
+ ; uses creatdir.dos.
+ include(creatdir)
+ 
+ ; Rename_file function.  All Unixes use rename and DOS uses
+ ; rename.dos.  There is also one called rename.hom which
+ ; is currently unused.  Hom stands for homemade.
+ include(rename)
+ 
+ ; Build_path function.  All Unixes use bld_path and DOS
+ ; uses bld_path.dos.
+ include(bld_path)
+ 
+ ; Last_cmpnt function.  All Unixes use lstcmpnt and DOS

+ include(expnfldr)
+ 
+ ; Fnexpand function.  All Unixes use fnexpand and DOS

+ 
+ ; Filter_filename function.  All Unixes use fltrname and DOS
+ ; uses fltrname.dos.
+ include(fltrname)
+ 
+ ; There are several versions of disk quotas.  Standard BSD-style quotas
+ ; (Australian) include diskquot.  Systems which don't have quotas use
+ ; diskquot.non.  Systems which use Sun-style quotas are slightly more
+ ; complicated.  They usually require different include files.  They are
+ ; set up to include the file sunquota and prepend include file info to
+ ; that.  See diskquot.*.
+ include(diskquot.non)
+ 
+ ; Read_file function.  All Unixes use readfile and DOS
+ ; uses readfile.dos.
+ include(readfile)
+ 
+ ; Create_tmpfile function.  This usually just calls the ANSI standard
+ ; tmpfile function if there is one.  That is the version in the file tempfile.
+ ; There is also a tempfile.non for Unix systems which don't have a tmpfile
+ ; function already.
+ include(tempfile)
+ 
+ ; Temp_nam function.  This usually just calls the "standard"
+ ; tmpnam function if there is one.  That is the version in the file tempnam.
+ include(tempnam)
+ 
+ ; Coredump function.  Version called coredump just calls abort, coredump.fpe
+ ; uses a floating point exception to cause the coredump on some systems.
+ include(coredump)
+ 
+ ; This is usually a call to gethostname.  That version is in the file hostname.
+ ; There is also a version called hostname.una which uses the uname system
+ ; call commonly found in SysV systems.  An unused version called
+ ; hostname.hom also exists.
+ include(hostname)
+ 
+ ; Getdomainnames function.  All Unixes use domnames and DOS
+ ; uses domnames.dos.
+ include(domnames)

+ ; Canonical_name function.  All Unixes use canonicl and DOS
+ ; uses canonicl.dos.
+ include(canonicl)
+ 
+ ; This file includes two functions, have_job_control and stop_process.
+ ; The Unix version is called jobcntrl and the slightly-different DOS
+ ; version is jobcntrl.dos.
+ include(jobcntrl)
+ 
+ ; Error_desciption function.  All Unixes use err_desc.  The version
+ ; called err_desc.dos is the same except that it doesn't declare the
+ ; variable sys_errlist[], which is already declared.  There
+ ; is also a version called err_desc.hom which is unused.
+ include(err_desc.dos)
+ 
+ ; There are six functions in this include.  They are get_system_login,
+ ; get_system_fullname, get_system_homedir, get_system_passwd, gcos_name,
+ ; and local_name_lookup.  The Unix version is pw_stuff and the dos version
+ ; is pw_stuff.dos.  There is also a pw_stuff.fun.  Fun stands for funny
+ ; GCOS field.  It's currently unused.
+ include(pw_stuff)
+ 
+ ; Change_passwd function.  Unixes use chnge_pw.
+ ; There is also a DOS version.
+ include(chnge_pw)
+ 
+ ; Mime_can_display function.  Only a single version of this now.
+ include(mimedisp)
+ 
+ ; Most systems have the ANSI fgetpos and fsetpos functions.  For those,
+ ; use fgetpos.  If a system doesn't have it use fgetpos.non.
+ include(fgetpos)
+ 
+ ; These functions are similar to popen(), but allow both an input stream 
+ ; and an output buffer.
+ include(pipe)
+ 
+ ; These functions are used to wait on a fork'd child doing our posting
+ include(postreap.wtp)
+ 
+ ; These functions are used to hand messages off to local mail transport
+ ; and posting agents (typically, "sendmail").
+ include(sendmail)
+ 
+ ; This function is used to actually spawn the given command (usually dredged
+ ; from mailcap) on the given data file (usually on /tmp).
+ include(execview)
+ 
+ ; This includes the various routines to support printing
+ include(print)
+ 
+ ; Debug file maintenance.
+ include(debuging)
