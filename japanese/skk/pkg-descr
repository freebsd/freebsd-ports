SKK (Simple Kana Kanji Convertor) is a very fast and efficient Japanese input
method system, written in emacs-lisp. SKK runs on NEmacs (Japanized Emacs18),
Mule (MULtilingual Emacs), and Demacs (DOS version of Emacs18/NEmacs).

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a "meta-port"
that depends on other SKK packages (skkserv, skk-elisp, skk-jisyo,
and skk-tools). Its sole purpose is to require dependencies so users can
install this package only and have all the SKK stuff pulled in by the
port/package dependency mechanism.
