Jishyo is an English -> Japanese dictionary. Currently it only supports
English queries. In the future I hope to add support for kana and kanji
queries, as well as multi-radical lookups for kanji. Jishyo is based in
large part on code from Jim Breen's xjdic. It also uses the dictionary
data from the same software.
