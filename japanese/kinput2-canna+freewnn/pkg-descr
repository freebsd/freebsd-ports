Kinput2 is an input server for X11 applications that want Japanese
text input.

A client that wants kana-kanji conversion service for Japanese text
sends a request to kinput2.  Kinput2 receives the request, does
kana-kanji conversion, and sends the converted text back to the
client.

The port supports Canna and Wnn4.  Egg key binding is avairable,
if you run

kinput2 -ccdef ccdef.kinput2.egg

WARNING: This kinput2 is applied the patch (patch-az in
/usr/ports/japanese/kinput2-wnn4/patches) that is modified by
Mr. Honma <honma@nasu-net.or.jp> to avoid problems of Filter Event
handle of XIM.
