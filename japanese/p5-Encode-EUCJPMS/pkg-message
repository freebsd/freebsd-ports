======================================================================
If you want to add eucJP-ms to Encode's demand-loading list (so you
don't have to "use Encode::EUCJPMS"), run

    enc2xs -C

to update Encode::ConfigLocal, a module that controls local settings.
After that, "use Encode;" is enough to load eucJP-ms on demand.
