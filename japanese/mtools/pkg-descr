Mtools is a collection of programs for reading, writing, and manipulating files
on an DOS FAT filesystem (usually a diskette).  Each one closely emulates
its DOS analog:

_Mtool_         _DOS_command_   _Description_
mattrib         ATTRIB          change MSDOS file attribute flags
mcd             CD              change MSDOS directory
mcopy           COPY            copy MSDOS files to/from Unix
mdel            DEL/ERASE       delete an MSDOS file
mdir            DIR             display an MSDOS directory
mformat         FORMAT          add MSDOS filesystem to a low-level format
mlabel          LABEL           make an MSDOS volume label.
mmd             MD/MKDIR        make an MSDOS subdirectory
mrd             RD/RMDIR        remove an MSDOS subdirectory
mread           COPY            low level read (copy) an MSDOS file to Unix
mren            REN/RENAME      rename an existing MSDOS file
mtype           TYPE            display contents of an MSDOS file
mwrite          COPY            alias for mcopy, will be removed soon

Filenames may include a drive letter, a colon, subdirectory, and filename, with
either '/' or '\' directory separator.  To use the '\' separator or wildcards,
escape the filenames with quotes.  The regular expression "pattern matching"
routines follow Unix-style rules:  '*' matches all files.  Archive, hidden,
read-only and system attributes are ignored in pattern matching.  SJIS Short
File Name and Unicode Long File Name files, and 1232 kB floppies, are supported.
