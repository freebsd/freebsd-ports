Tgif2tex allows us to use LaTeX commands in figures drawn by Tgif.  It
extracts strings and their positions from the figure and converts it
in picture environment of the LaTeX.  It also converts other
components of the figure such as lines, circles, ovals, etc into EPS.

Execute the following commands for example.

% cd /usr/local/share/doc/tgif2tex
% tgif2tex example.obj
% latex example.tex
% xdvi example.tex

Detailed document /usr/local/share/doc/tgif2tex/how-to-use.tex
(written in Japanese [JIS code]) is available.  To typeset it, execute
'make' in the directory /usr/local/share/doc/tgif2tex.
