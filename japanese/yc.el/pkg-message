**********************************************************************
Quick Setup:

(1) Add the following two lines in your $HOME/.emacs file;

  (load "yc")
  (global-yc-mode 1) ;; if you need ANK-conversion-mode in all buffers

(2) Set the following environment variables;

  CANNAHOST	hostname of cannaserver
  CANNALIBDIR	a full path of the directory containing 'default.canna'

  These values are also configurable in .emacs by setting variables
  'yc-server-host' and 'yc-canna-lib-path'.
**********************************************************************
Note:
  If you want to use UNIX-domain socket for communication with cannaserver
  in emacs21 or former version of emacsen, define WITH_ICANNA to add
  dependency to ports ja-icanna.
