This package contains the binary release of Japanized Tcl8.0, 
an embeddable tool command language.

Many thanks to Mr. Nishinaka and tcl-jp team.

The best way to get started with Tcl is to read ``Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit'' by John K. Ousterhout, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-63337-X. 
And Japanized version of this document is available. 
`` Tcl and Tk Toolkit'', SOFTBANK, ISBN4-89052-819-9.

NOTE: A full set of manual pages is provided by the package "tcl-8.0".
This package does NOT contain it.
