KON2 is a program for displaying Kanji (japanese characters) on the
console of Linux/FreeBSD. KON2 hooks the output of console and
redirects to pseudo tty, drawing on the VGA display.

If KON2 would be going to something wrong, check shared-memories being
loading or not. If not, add "options SYSVSHM" to
/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/GENERIC, and reconfigure the kernel.

Be aware that using KON2 with X is not allowed (You should shutdown X first
when you use KON2, and vice versa).

In order to use 30 lines (default is 25), modify the "Normal" entry of
kon.cfg as follows:
-------
VGA:Normal
        VGA
        640 680 768 800 480 491 493 525
        1
        79 29
