Skkinput is an input method for X11 applications that want Japanese
text input.

A client that wants kana-kanji conversion service for Japanese text
sends a request to skkinput.  Skkinput receives the request, does
kana-kanji conversion, and sends the converted text back to the
client.

From version 3.0, skkinput becomes an emacs-lisp like interpreter,
and uses skk.el in skk-8.6 as an conversion engine.
