Kdrill is a program to quiz folks on
   { English }       { English }
   { Kanji   }  <->  { Kanji   }
   { Kana    }       { Kana    }

It will quiz you on either the whole dictionary [around 6000 Kanji?]
or specific Kanji, that you hand-pick. There are also other ways to
narrow down which Kanji you are quizzed on.
