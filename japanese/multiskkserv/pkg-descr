multiskkserv is a skk server which can search multiple dictionaries.
This server uses cdb format as the dictionary format.  cdb is the
efficient and constant (i.e. cannot add, delete, modify) database
format by Dan J. Bernstein, which I think is the appropriate format
for the system-wide constant dictionary storage.

This is very experimental.
