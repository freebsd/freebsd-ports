dbskkd-cdb is a dictionary server for the SKK Japanese input method
system. dbskkd-cdb uses the cdb constant database package for faster
dictionary access.

dbskkd-cdb is compatible with skkserv on the protocol behavior.  It is
designed to be called from "super-server" programs such as inetd
or tcpserver. The I/O operation is solely with the stdio interface.
