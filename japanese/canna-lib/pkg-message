Now the cannaserver uses a UNIX domain scoekt by default.  If you need
to use a TCP connection, please edit your /etc/rc.conf (or alike) and
add the -inet command-line option to canna_flags, i.e.:

    canna_flags="-u bin -inet"

Also, note that canna startup script now uses the rcNG mechanism, so
if you'd like to start Canna server on local system, enable it in your
/etc/rc.conf, i.e.:

    canna_enable="yes"
