KanjiPad - Japanese Handwriting recognition - By Owen Taylor <otaylor@gtk.org>

KanjiPad is a very simple program for handwriting recognition -
The user draws a character into the box, then requests translation.
The best candidates are displayed along the right hand side of
the window and can be selected for pasting into other programs.
