This package contains only the executables for mule-2.3, a multilingual
editor based on emacs-19.34.

You should install the mule-common-2.3 package containing emacs lisp
files, info pages, and so on (except executables) for mule-2.3.

This package is built with Japanese support, using Canna or FreeWnn.
It supports the following input methods: jeonkak, hangul for
Korean (Hanja), and quanjiao, zhuyin, erpin for Chinese (check out
${LOCALBASE}/lib/mule/site-lisp/site-start.el).

This package and the package, mule-common-2.3, *will* clobber any
existing emacs installation.  In particular, the executables and man
pages of etags/ctags are installed, and the info pages that come with
the original emacs get installed too.

Although this shouldn't cause any problems to run both mule and emacs,
it may cause some confusion when one of them is pkg_delete'd.  If
someone has a solution to this, please tell me.

A info "dir" file is supplied in the ${PORTSDIR}/editors/mule-common/files/
subdirectory of the ports package.  Copy it into your /usr/local/info
to read mule info pages, but also make sure you also add everything
that may have been added to that file!

[Notice]
Mr. Yoshio KATAYAMA <kate@pfu.co.jp> fixed many bugs for mule-2.3.
Patches for those are in 'mule-2.3-19.34.patch-YYMMDD.tar.gz' and are
applied in this port.
