Less is a program similar to more(1), but which allows backward
movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not
have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large
input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi(1).

This enhanced less support ISO 2022 code extension techniqes and
Japanese codes(EUC Japanese, SJIS) and compressed(or gzipped) file
viewing.  The author of the patch is jam@pobox.com, and the UTF-8
support patch is written by bogytech.
