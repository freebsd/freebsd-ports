This is Wnn4.2, a Japanese/Chinese/Korean input method.  It is
included primarily so that we can compile mule-2.1, a multilingual
emacs.

Only the Japanese version is built for this port.

Note that binaries and libraries go to /usr/local, while man pages and 
includes go to /usr/X11R6.  That's the way it was designed, I don't
know why.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

This also include some patches for FreeBSD or bugfixes.
If use these patches, you can compile Wnn-4.2 under XFree86 3.1.2E
 or later (X11Release6.1).
If there are any problem in these patches, please tell me via E-mail.

Mr. Yoshio KATAYAMA <kate@pfu.co.jp> fixed many bugs for Wnn4.2.
Patches for those are in 'Wnn4.2.patch-YYMMDD.tar.gz' and are applied
in this port.

[Notice]
(1) When compiling this port, if $LOCALBASE is not '/usr/local' and/or
$X11BASE is not '/usr/X11R6' then you should properly change two lines
'@cwd /usr/local' and '@cwd /usr/X11R6' in
$PORTSDIR/japanese/Wnn/pkg/PLIST.

(2) You must set a environment variable JSERVER if you use a client of
Wnn.
