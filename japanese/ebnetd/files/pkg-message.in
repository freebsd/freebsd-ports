You'll need manual configurations to actually activate EBNETD servers
(ebhttpd/ebnetd/ndtpd).

Step 0(optional):
If you want to setup private syslog, edit /etc/syslog.conf.

Step 1:
Copy a sample configuration file `ebnetd.conf.sample' to `ebnetd.conf'
in `%%PREFIX%%/etc' directory, and edit it. Consult the "Configuration
File" section of info file.

Step 2a:
To start EBNETD servers as standalone daemons, add the following lines
to /etc/rc.conf:
ebhttpd_enable (bool): Set to "NO" by default.
                       Set it to "YES" to enable ebhttpd.
ebhttpd_flags (str):   Set to "" by default.
                       Extra flags passed to start ebhttpd.
ebnetd_enable (bool):  Set to "NO" by default.
                       Set it to "YES" to enable ebnetd.
ebnetd_flags (str):    Set to "" by default.
                       Extra flags passed to start ebnetd.
ndtpd_enable (bool):   Set to "NO" by default.
                       Set it to "YES" to enable ndtpd.
ndtpd_flags (str):     Set to "" by default.
                       Extra flags passed to start ndtpd.

Step 2b:
To start EBNETD servers as child processes of 'inetd', edit
/etc/inetd.conf. Consult the "Run `xxxx' as a child of `inetd'"
sections of info file.
