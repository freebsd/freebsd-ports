terminals.  It converts input kanji code to designated kanji code such
as 7-bit JIS, MS-kanji (shifted-JIS) or EUC.

One of the most unique facicility of nkf is the guess of the input
kanji code.  It currently recognizes 7-bit JIS, MS-kanji (shifted-JIS)
and EUC.  So users needn't the input kanji code specification.
