Nkf is a yet another kanji code converter among networks, hosts and
terminals.  It converts input kanji code to designated kanji code such
as 7-bit JIS, MS-kanji (shifted-JIS), EUC, or UTF-8.

One of the most unique facicility of nkf is the guess of the input
kanji code.  It currently recognizes 7-bit JIS, MS-kanji (shifted-JIS),
EUC, and UTF-8.  So users needn't the input kanji code specification.
