Elvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor.  Elvis supports
nearly all of the vi/ex commands, in both visual mode and colon mode.

This is version 1.8pl4 with a kanji patch to display & Edit Japanese. 
It understands JIS/EUC/Shift-JIS. It display Kanji character with JIS
code by default: if you want to display with EUC/Shift-JIS, add "-kdeuc"
/"-ksjis" to the command line option.

Also at startup time, jelvis read `.elvisrc', not `.exrc'.  If you use
`.exrc', change config.h and recompile.
