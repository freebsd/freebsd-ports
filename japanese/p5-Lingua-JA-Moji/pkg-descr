This module provides methods to convert different written forms of
Japanese into one another.  It enables conversion between romanized
Japanese, hiragana, and katakana.  It also includes a number of
unusual encodings such as Japanese braille and morse code, as well as
conversions between Japanese and Cyrillic and Hangul.  It also handles
conversion between the Chinese characters (kanji) used before and
after the character reforms of 1949, as well as the various bracketed
and circled forms of kana and kanji.
