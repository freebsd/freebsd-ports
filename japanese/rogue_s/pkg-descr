This is a port of Rogue-clone: Version II, but it is enhanced to display
messages with Japanese, colored and messages are separated from program
(you can make another message version of rogue).

This port provide you 4 message files:
- Original English message [mesg_E]
  (but it was broken, please recompile without -DJAPAN, sorry).
- Japanised message [mesg]
- UTMC (University of Tokyo Microcomputer Club) message [mesg_utmc]
- fj.* message [mesg_fj]

In this version, high score will be sorted to record by score only,
and you can record your own score more than one time.


You have to specify a message file to play this version of rogue like this:
	% rogue_s mesg
or without argument, rogue_s will list available messages.
