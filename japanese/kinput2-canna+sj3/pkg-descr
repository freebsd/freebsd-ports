Kinput2 is an input server for X11 applications that want Japanese
text input.

A client that wants kana-kanji conversion service for Japanese text
sends a request to kinput2.  Kinput2 receives the request, does
kana-kanji conversion, and sends the converted text back to the
client.

The port was done by Hidekazu Kuroki (hidekazu@cs.titech.ac.jp).
It supports Canna and SJ3.
