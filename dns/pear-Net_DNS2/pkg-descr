pear-Net_DNS2 provides (roughly) the same functionality as Net_DNS, but
using PHP5 objects, exceptions for error handling, better sockets support.

This release is (in most cases) 2x - 10x faster than Net_DNS, as well as
includes more RR's (including DNSSEC RR's), and improved sockets and streams
support.
