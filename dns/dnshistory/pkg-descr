Provide a means for storing a history of DNS/Name changes for the IP Addresses
extracted from web log files. The major target being that multiple analyses of
older log files do not require re-lookups of IP Address to FQDNs, and
additionally maintain the accuracy of the lookup as it was then and not as it
is now.
