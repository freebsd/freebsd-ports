Zonemaster is a software package that validates the quality of a DNS
delegation. The ambition of the Zonemaster project is to develop and
maintain an open source DNS validation tool.

This module provides the backend infrastructure for Zonemaster,
implementing a JSON-RPC API server and test agent daemon. It manages
test scheduling, result storage, and system configuration through
multiple database backends (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite). The Backend
enables integration with web interfaces and automation tools while
maintaining a persistent history of test results.
