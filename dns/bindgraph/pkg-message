To get bindgraph working, you have to set querylog for bind. An example
named.conf will be

  logging {
    channel "querylog" {
      file "/var/log/query.log" versions 50 size 20m;
      print-time yes;
    };
    category queries { querylog; };
  };

Make sure BINDGRAPH_USER (default www) can read this log file.
