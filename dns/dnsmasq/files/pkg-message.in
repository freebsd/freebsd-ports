To enable dnsmasq, edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/dnsmasq.conf and
set dnsmasq_enable="YES" in /etc/rc.conf[.local]

Further options and actions are documented inside
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/dnsmasq


NOTE: when using dnssec, inaccurate system clocks
can cause DNS resolution to fail
because DNSSEC signatures may then not validate.
