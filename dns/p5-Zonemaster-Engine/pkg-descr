Zonemaster is a software package that validates the quality of a DNS
delegation. The ambition of the Zonemaster project is to develop and
maintain an open source DNS validation tool.

This module is the core engine of Zonemaster, implementing all DNS tests
and validation rules. It performs comprehensive checks on domain name
delegation, including DNSSEC, IPv6 readiness, and compliance with
relevant RFCs and industry best practices.
