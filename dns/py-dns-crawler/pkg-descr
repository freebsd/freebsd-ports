Despite the name, the crawler gets info for more services than just DNS:
- DNS:
  - all A/AAAA records (for the 2nd level domain and www.subdomain), annotated
    with GeoIP
  - TXT records (with SPF and DMARC parsed for easier filtering)
  - TLSA (for the 2nd level domain and www.subdomain)
  - MX
  - DNSSEC validation
  - nameservers:
    - each server IP annotated with GeoIP
    - HOSTNAME.BIND, VERSION.BIND, AUTHORS.BIND and fortune (also for all IPs)
  - users can add custom additional RRs in the config file
- E-mail (for every server from MX):
  - SMTP server banners (optional, ports are configurable)
  - TLSA records
- Web:
  - HTTP status & headers (inc. parsed cookies) for ports 80 & 443 on each IP
    from A/AAAA records
  - certificate info for HTTPS (optionally with an entire cert chain)
  - webpage content (optional)
  - everything of the above is saved for each step in the redirect history --
    the crawler follows redirects until it gets a non-redirecting status or hits
    a configurable limit
