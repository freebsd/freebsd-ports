This module provides a Perl interface to the ldns library from NLnet Labs and
depends on it being available. The module can either compile and use those
libraries internally or link to already available ldns library given that the
version is high enough. In both cases it relies on a sufficiently recent
version of OpenSSL being present.

This module is written as part of the Zonemaster project, and therefore
primarily exposes the functionality needed for that. Since Zonemaster is a
diagnostic tool, that means the functions most used are those for looking
things up and inspecting them.
