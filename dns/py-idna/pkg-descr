A library to support the Internationalised Domain Names in Applications
(IDNA) protocol as specified in RFC 5891. This version of the protocol
is often referred to as "IDNA2008" and can produce different res
lts from the earlier standard from 2003.

The library is also intended to act as a suitable drop-in replacement
for the "encodings.idna" module that comes with the Python standard
library but currently only supports the older 2003 specification.
