Zonemaster is a software package that validates the quality of a DNS
delegation. The ambition of the Zonemaster project is to develop and
maintain an open source DNS validation tool.

This module provides a feature-rich command-line interface to the
Zonemaster Engine. It supports multiple output formats including
plain text, JSON, and structured formats suitable for integration
with other tools. The CLI allows for detailed DNS delegation testing
with customizable test profiles and verbosity levels.
