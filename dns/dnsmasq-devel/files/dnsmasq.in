# PROVIDE: dnsmasq
# REQUIRE: SERVERS ldconfig
# BEFORE:  DAEMON named
# KEYWORD: shutdown
#
# Start before named so as not to break named_wait if named is
# enabled and /etc/resolv.conf points to ourselves (dnsmasq).
#
#
# Please add the following line to /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf to
# enable the dnsmasq service(s):
#
# dnsmasq_enable (bool):  Set to "NO" by default.
#                         Set it to "YES" to enable dnsmasq at boot.
#
# Further settings you can change in /etc/rc.conf if desired:
#
# dnsmasq_conf (path):    Set to %%PREFIX%%/etc/dnsmasq.conf by default.
#                         Set it to another configuration file if you want.
#
# dnsmasq_flags (string): Empty by default. Set it to additional command
#                         line arguments if desired.
#
# dnsmasq_restart (bool): Set to "YES" by default.
#                         If "YES", a "reload" action will trigger a "restart"
#                         if the configuration file has changed, to work
#                         around a dnsmasq(8) limitation.
#
#
# Additional actions supported by this script:
#
# reload        Reload database files by sending SIGHUP and SIGUSR2.
#               However, if dnsmasq_restart is true (see above) and the
#               configuration file has changed since this rc script has
#               started dnsmasq, restart it instead.
#
# logstats      Dump statistics information to where dnsmasq is configured to
#               log (syslog by default). This sends SIGUSR1 to dnsmasq.
