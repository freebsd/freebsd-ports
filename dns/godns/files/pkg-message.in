  message: <<EOM
  Edit /etc/rc.conf(.local) to start GoDNS automatically at system
  startup. Command line arguments can be set via godns_args.

  A sample configuration file is installed at the follow location:
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/godns-config.json.sample

  If you're testing out your setup be aware that GoDNS will refuse
  to run if you've disabled external ip address lookup and your
  local interface uses a private ip address.

  Logfile is located at /var/log/godns/godns.log
