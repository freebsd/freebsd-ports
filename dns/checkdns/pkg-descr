This program is a domain name server analysis and reporting tool.
It checks and reports whether a domain name, hosted by your organization,
is still in use, and if so, reports whether your name servers are
still the delegated name servers of the domain name in question.

Reports are generated both to the console and as HTML output.
HTMLs also include information about the MX and WWW records of the domain name.

The tool is expected to be of great use for Internet Service Providers
who are in need of keeping track of lame dns records.
