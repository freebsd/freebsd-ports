Autoserial support has been removed. The change_date column has been
removed from the records table in all gsql backends, but leaving it
in is harmless.

The Generic PostgreSQL backend schema has changed: the notified_serial
column type in the domains table has been changed from INT DEFAULT NULL
to BIGINT DEFAULT NULL:

    ALTER TABLE domains ALTER notified_serial TYPE bigint USING CASE
      WHEN notified_serial >= 0 THEN notified_serial::bigint END;

(mssql), gpgsql, and gsqlite3 backends. SQL statements are available

MyDNS and OpenDBX backends had been removed per https://Blog.PowerDNS.com/2019/10/17/backend-removals-in-the-upcoming-authoritative-server-release/.

The new "unpublished DNSSEC keys" feature comes with a mandatory schema
change for all database backends (including BIND with a DNSSEC database).

This version needs a mandatory schema change for the gmsyql, godbc(mssql),
