Autoserial support has been removed. The change_date column has been removed from the records table 
in all gsql backends, but leaving it in is harmless.
The Generic PostgreSQL backend schema has changed: the notified_serial column type in the domains 
table has been changed from INT DEFAULT NULL to BIGINT
DEFAULT NULL:
ALTER TABLE domains ALTER notified_serial TYPE bigint USING CASE WHEN notified_serial >= 0 THEN 
notified_serial::bigint END;
