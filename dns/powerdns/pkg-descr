The PowerDNS Authoritative Server is the only solution that enables
authoritative DNS service from all major databases, including but
not limited to MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite3, LDAP and plain text files.

DNS answers can also be fully scripted using a variety of (scripting)
languages such as Lua, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, C and C++. Such
scripting can be used for dynamic redirection, (spam) filtering or
real time intervention.

In addition, the PowerDNS Authoritative Server is the leading DNSSEC
implementation, hosting the majority of all DNSSEC domains worldwide.
The Authoritative Server hosts at least 30% of all domain names in
Europe, and around 90% of all DNSSEC domains in Europe.
