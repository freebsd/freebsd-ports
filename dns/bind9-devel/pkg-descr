BIND version 9 is a major rewrite of nearly all aspects of the underlying BIND
architecture.  Some of the important features of BIND 9 are:

DNS Security: DNSSEC (signed zones), TSIG (signed DNS requests)
IP version 6: Answers DNS queries on IPv6 sockets, IPv6 resource records (AAAA)
     Experimental IPv6 Resolver Library
DNS Protocol Enhancements: IXFR, DDNS, Notify, EDNS0
     Improved standards conformance
Views: One server process can provide multiple "views" of the DNS namespace,
     e.g. an "inside" view to certain clients, and an "outside" view to others.
Multiprocessor Support

See the CHANGES file for more information on new features.
