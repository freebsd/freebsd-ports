gen6dns is a tool to generate static DNS records (AAAA and PTR) for hosts
using Stateless Address Autoconfig (SLAAC). If you have a list of hostnames,
mac addresses and ipv6 subnets gen6dns generates the appropriate AAAA and
PTR records for you. It supports different scopes and the generation of
view (split) specific files.
