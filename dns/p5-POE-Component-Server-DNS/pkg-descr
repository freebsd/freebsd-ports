POE::Component::Server::DNS is a POE component that implements a DNS server.

It uses POE::Component::Client::DNS to handle resolving when configured as
'forward_only' and Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse wrapped by
POE::Component::Generic to perform recursion.

One may add handlers to massage and manipulate responses to particular queries
which is vaguely modelled after Net::DNS::Nameserver.
