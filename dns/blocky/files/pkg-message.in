  message: <<EOM
A sample configuration file is installed at the following location:
%%PREFIX%%/etc/blocky-config.yml.sample

Default location for configuration file when using rc.d script:
%%PREFIX%%/etc/blocky-config.yml

With the default configuration, blocky listens on port 53 (TCP and UDP).
If running as a non-root user, use a different port in blocky configuration,
such as `port: 5053`, or use mac_portacl(4) to allow binding to port 53.

Example setup for mac_portacl(4):

In /boot/loader.conf:

	mac_portacl_load="YES"

In /etc/sysctl.conf (where <ID> is the UID of your user):

	net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedhigh=0
	security.mac.portacl.rules=uid:<ID>:tcp:53,uid:<ID>:udp:53

Please refer to the documentation located at
https://0xerr0r.github.io/blocky/ for further information.
