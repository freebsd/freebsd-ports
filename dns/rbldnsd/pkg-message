The rbldnsd port has been installed with an example zone file, located
in %%PREFIX%%/etc/rbldnsd/.

After starting the daemon with this example data, you should be able to
test the success of your install with the command:

	% host -a 1.1.168.192.bl.example.com. localhost
or
	% dig @localhost 1.1.168.192.bl.example.com. any

If you see a response that mentions 127.0.0.2, the install worked!
