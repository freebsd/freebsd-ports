AnyEvent::DNS::EtcHosts AnyEvent::DNS behavior to use /etc/hosts

The DNS lookups are emulated. This resolver returns the standard DNS reply based
 on /etc/hosts file rather than real DNS.
You can choose different file by changing PERL_ANYEVENT_HOSTS
environment variable.
This module also disables original AnyEvent::Socket's helper function
which reads /etc/hosts file after DNS entry was not found.
It prevents to read this file twice.
The AnyEvent::Socket resolver searches IPv4 and IPv6 addresses separately.
If you don't want to check the addresses in DNS, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
should be placed in /etc/hosts or the protocol family should be set explicitly
for resolve_sockaddr function.
