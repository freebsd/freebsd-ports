The nsnotifyd daemon monitors a set of DNS zones and runs a command 
when any of them change. It listens for DNS NOTIFY messages so it can
respond to changes promptly. It also uses each zone's SOA refresh and
retry parameters to poll for updates if nsnotifyd does not receive
NOTIFY messages more frequently.
