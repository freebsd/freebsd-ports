YADIFA is a lightweight authoritative Name Server with DNSSEC capabilities.
Developed by the passionate people behind the .eu top-level domain, YADIFA has
been built from scratch to face today?s DNS challenges, with no compromise on
security, speed and stability, to offer a better and safer Internet experience.

YADIFA has a simple configuration syntax and can handle more queries per second
while maintaining one of the lowest memory footprints in the industry. YADIFA
also has one of the fastest zone file load times ever recorded on a name
server.

YADIFA was developed on FreeBSD and a GNU/Linux. It works on OSX and will be
soon ported to other Unix flavours like OpenBSD and Solaris. A Microsoft
Windows version is also on the cards.
