Twisted Names is both a domain name server as well as a client resolver
library. Twisted Names comes with an "out of the box" nameserver which can
read most BIND-syntax zone files as well as a simple Python-based
configuration format. Twisted Names can act as an authoritative server,
perform zone transfers from a master to act as a secondary, act as a caching
nameserver, or any combination of these. Twisted Names' client resolver
library provides functions to query for all commonly used record types as
well as a replacement for the blocking gethostbyname() function provided by
the Python stdlib socket module.

Twisted Names is available under the MIT Free Software licence.
