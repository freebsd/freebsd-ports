BIND version 9 is a major rewrite of nearly all aspects of the underlying BIND
architecture.  Some of the important features of BIND 9 are:

DNS Security: DNSSEC (signed zones), TSIG (signed DNS requests)
IP version 6: Answers DNS queries on IPv6 sockets, IPv6 resource records (AAAA)
     Experimental IPv6 Resolver Library
DNS Protocol Enhancements: IXFR, DDNS, Notify, EDNS0
     Improved standards conformance
Views: One server process can provide multiple "views" of the DNS namespace,
     e.g. an "inside" view to certain clients, and an "outside" view to others.
Multiprocessor Support

BIND 9.8 includes a number of changes from BIND 9.7 and earlier releases,
including:
	Preliminary DNS64 support (AAAA synthesis only initially)

See the CHANGES file for more information on features.
