Some of the new features of BIND 9.7.x are:

	- Fully automatic signing of zones by "named"
	- Simplified configuration of DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV)
	- Simplified configuration of Dynamic DNS, using the "ddns-confgen"
	  command line tool or the "local" update-policy option
	- New named option "attach-cache" that allows multiple views to
	  share a single cache
	- DNS rebinding attack prevention
	- New default values for dnssec-keygen parameters
	- Support for RFC 5011 automated trust anchor maintenance
	  (see README.rfc5011 for additional details)
