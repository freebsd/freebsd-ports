The dnsutl package is a collection tools to make administering DNS easier.
These include programs for:

 * Generating the reverse DNS mapping by using the DNS forward mapping.
   This is useful for producing a self-consistent DNS configuration.
 * Generating the /etc/ethers file by using a bogus record type.
 * Generating the /etc/hosts file by using the DNS forward mapping.
 * Generating the /etc/bootptab file by using the MAC and IP information.
 * Generating the /etc/netgroup file by using the DNS forward mapping.
 * Generating the Sun /etc/bootparams file by using the MAC and IP information.
 * Checking the new-style /etc/named.conf files for self-consistency.
 * Checking the old-style /etc/named.boot files for self-consistency.
 * Generating the DNS forward mapping by using the /etc/hosts file.
   This could be a first step to configuring your DNS server.
 * Generating the /etc/dhcp.conf file by using the MAC and IP information.

All of these programs are both faster than shell scripts, and more
robust when faced with all the peculiar semantics of DNS resource files.
They even understand the $include directive.
