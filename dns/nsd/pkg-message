*
*   To run nsd from startup, add nsd_enable="YES" to your etc/rc.conf
*
*   Starting with nsd version 4 the old nsdc control program has been
*   replaced by nsd-control. This requires some manual setup with
*   nsd-control-setup and editing of the config files.
*
*   nsd-control is incompatible with nsdc so when that is used in scripts,
*   these should be adapted
