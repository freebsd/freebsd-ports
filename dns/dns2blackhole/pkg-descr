Malware Prevention through Domain Blocking (Black Hole)

dns2blackhole is a set of Bourne Shell csh scripts that fetch host files
from public host file providers that contain the FQDN [ Fully Qualified
Domain Names ] of sites that fall into the following categories, adware,
malware, exploit, hijackers, harvesters, tracking, phishing, fake news,
fraud, spam, sex, porn, gambling, advertisements, misleading marketing,
illegal pharmacy, warez/piracy and others. The output of the dns2blackhole
scripts is fed directly into the ports/package versions of unbound, named,
and dnsmask DNS servers to block those FQDN thus protecting user
devices from being compromised or bothered seeing things of no interest.
The base built-in version of unbound titled "local_unbound" can also be
configured to work using the dns2blackhole method. This black hole method
is another layer of protection that you can customize to your needs.
