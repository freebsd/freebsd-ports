# For authentication via TLS, x509 certificates need to be provided.
# The server needs a tuple of the certificate file and private key file:
# --tls-server-cert mydomain.crt,mydomain.key
# The domain in the Common Name field of the certificate will be announced.
#
# For domain lookup, we need to provide appropiate CA certificates.
# Try various locations:
--tls-client-cert %%LOCALBASE%%/share/certs

# As an alternative, create a secret/public key via 'kadnode --bob-create-key'
# and load the secret keys as PEM file:
# --bob-load-key <secret-key-pem-file>
#
# Other nodes can use <public-key-hex>.p2p in the browser to resolve the node.

# Enable DNS proxy behavior. Reads /etc/resolv.conf by default.
# --dns-proxy-enable
#
# Or specify a DNS server by IP address:
# --dns-proxy-server <IP-address>
