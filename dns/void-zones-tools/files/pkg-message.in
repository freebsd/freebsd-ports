To download the host lists and convert them to void zones,
run the following script:
%%PREFIX%%/bin/void-zones-update.sh

To add your own white list/black list entries, to add over override
the bundled listings, edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/void-zones/my_void_hosts.txt.
Use the IP address 1.1.1.1 for whitelisting, and 0.0.0.0 for blacklisting.

Add the following line to your unbound.conf, prior to any forwarder directives:
include: /var/unbound/local-void.zones
Then restart Unbound.

For future updates, run void-zones-update.sh and restart Unbound.
