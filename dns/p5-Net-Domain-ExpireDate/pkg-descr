Net::Domain::ExpireDate gets WHOIS information of given domain
using Net::Whois::Raw and tries to obtain expiration date of
domain. Unfortunately there are too many different whois servers
which provides whois info in very different formats.

Net::Domain::ExpireDate knows more than 40 different formats of
expiration date representation provided by different servers (almost
all gTLD registrars and some ccTLD registrars are covered).
Now obtaining of domain creation date is also supported.
