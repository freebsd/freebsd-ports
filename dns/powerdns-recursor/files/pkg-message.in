 If you want to use the PowerDNS Recursor,
 you need the following line in /etc/rc.conf(.local)
 or in /etc/rc.conf.d/pdns_recursor

    pdns_recursor_enable="YES"

 Configuration templates are available in %%PREFIX%%/etc/pdns
 as recursor.conf-dist.

{ type: upgrade
  minimum_version: "5.1.0"
  message: <<EOM
Since version 5.1.0 the tarball no longer contains a recursor.conf-dist
and users need to start using the YAML format.

A new command is available to the rc.d script, showyaml, which converts
the old config to YAML format. This can be run via:
  service pdns_recursor showyaml

It ony shows the new config and won't overwrite your old config.

Please double check if everything has been converted correctly.
