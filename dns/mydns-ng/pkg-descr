MyDNS - SQL-based DNS server

This is the MyDNS package.  MyDNS is a simple, non-recursive Internet
name daemon which serves records directly from an SQL database.  It
currently works with either MySQL or PostgreSQL.

This version of the MyDNS package is a development of the original one
produced by Don Moore.
