Bundy is a new applications framework for Internet infrastructure, such as DNS,
DHCP, NTP. The Bundy framework consists of a control framework, an application
interface, a statistics server, a logging framework, a remote control daemon, a
configuration client tool, and numerous other tools for its development and
operation.

Multiple infrastructure applications modules can be run under this framework.
The Bundy authoritative DNS application is one such application. Bundy-DNS is
designed to be dynamically-updated, easily extensible, and to leverage a
database back-end.

The ISC started work on BIND 10 in 2009. In 2014 it became a community project
and was renamed Bundy.
