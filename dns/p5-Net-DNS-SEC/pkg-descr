The Net::DSN::SEC suite provides the resource records that are needed for
DNSSEC (RFC 4033, 4034 and 4035). In addition the DLV RR, a clone of the DS
RR is supported (RFC 4431)

It also provides support for SIG0. That later is useful for dynamic updates
using key-pairs.

RSA and DSA crypto routines are supported.

For details see Net::DNS::RR::RRSIG, Net::DNS::RR::DNSKEY,
Net::DNS::RR::NSEC, Net::DNS::RR:DS, Net::DNS::RR::DLV, and see
Net::DNS::RR::SIG and Net::DNS::RR::KEY for the use with SIG0.

Net::DNS contains all needed hooks to load the Net::DNS::SEC extensions when
they are available.

See Net::DNS for general help.
