dnsjit is a combination of parts taken from dsc, dnscap, drool, and
put together around Lua to create a script-based engine for easy
capturing, parsing and statistics gathering of DNS messages while
also providing facilities for replaying DNS traffic.

One of the core functionality that dnsjit brings is to tie together
C and Lua modules through a receiver/receive interface. This allows
creation of custom chains of functionality to meet various requirements.
Another core functionality is the ability to parse and process DNS
messages even if the messages are non-compliant with the DNS
standards.
