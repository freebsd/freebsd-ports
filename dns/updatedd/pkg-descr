Updatedd is a program for Unix like operating systems to
update dynamic DNS records.  It supports multiple services,
including:

	changeip.com
	dyndns.org
	eurodyndns.org
	ovh.com,
	no-ip.org
	ods.org
	hn.org
	regfish.com
	tzo.com

Each service is represented by a plugin, therefore it is
very simple to add support for additional services.

Furthermore the package includes a wrapper for updatedd
called `updatedd-wrapper'.  It provides support for
configuration files and IP adddress caching.
