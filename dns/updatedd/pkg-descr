Updatedd is a client to update dynamic dns settings.
With the use of the pppd ip-up script it can update
these settings automatically for you. 
Updatedd does not run as a daemon.

It is divided into one main program and one plugin for each
supported service. The plugins are dynamic libraries which
are loaded by the main program. So it is possible to remove
support for services you don't need.

Supported Services:
ods.org, dyndns.org, ovh.net, no-ip.org, hn.org
