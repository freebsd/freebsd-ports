	Net::DNS is a collection of Perl modules to interface with
	the Domain Name System (DNS) resolver.  It allows the
	programmer to perform queries that are beyond the
	capabilities of gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.

	There are also methods for dealing with creating and
	parsing dynamic updates packets.
