       Net::DNS is a collection of Perl modules to interface with
       the Domain Name System (DNS) resolver.  It allows the
       programmer to perform queries that are beyond the
       capabilities of gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.

       Resolver Objects

       A resolver object is an instance of the Net::DNS::Resolver
       class.  A program can have multiple resolver objects, each
       maintaining its own state information such as the
       nameservers to be queried, whether recursion is desired,
       etc.

       Packet Objects

       Net::DNS::Resolver queries return Net::DNS::Packet
       objects.  Packet objects have five sections:

       o  The header section, a Net::DNS::Header object.

       o  The question section, a list of Net::DNS::Question
          objects.

       o  The answer section, a list of Net::DNS::RR objects.

       o  The authority section, a list of Net::DNS::RR objects.

       o  The additional section, a list of Net::DNS::RR objects.

       Header Objects

       Net::DNS::Header objects represent the header section of a
       DNS packet.

       Question Objects

       Net::DNS::Question objects represent the query section of
       a DNS packet.

       RR Objects

       Net::DNS::RR is the base class for DNS resource record
       (RR) objects in the answer, authority, and additional
       sections of a DNS packet.
