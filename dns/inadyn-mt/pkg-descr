inadyn, inadyn-advanced fork. A multi-OS (*NIX, BSD, NT, 32 bit Win)
console/service/daemon dynamic DNS client.

It gives the possibility to have your own fixed hostname registered on the
internet, although your IP might be changing. It checks periodically whether
the IP address stored by the DNS server is the real current IP address of the
machine that is running it.
