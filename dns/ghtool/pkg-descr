To quote from the SourceForge project description:

   gh-tool is a command-line interface to gethostby*, in libresolv/libc.
   It allows one to check the local system's notion of an IP->DNS or
   DNS->IP mapping, including aliases, directly, rather than digging for
   mappings in DNS, which may or may not be relevant.
