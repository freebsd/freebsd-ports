## IP addresses and ports to listen to, as well as their external IP
## If there is no NAT involved, `local` and `external` can be the same.
## As many addresses as needed can be configured here, IPv4 and/or IPv6.
## You should at least change the `external` IP address.

### Example with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses:
# listen_addrs = [
#     { local = "0.0.0.0:443",    external = "198.51.100.1:443" },
#     { local = "[::]:443",       external = "[2001:db8::1]:443" }
# ]

listen_addrs = [
    { local = "0.0.0.0:443",    external = "198.51.100.1:443" }

## Queries sent to that name will return the client IP address.
## This can be very useful for debugging, or to check that relaying works.
