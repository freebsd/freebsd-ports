getdns is a modern asynchronous DNS API.

It implements DNS entry points from a design developed and vetted by application
developers, in an API specification edited by Paul Hoffman. With the development
of this API, we intend to offer application developers a modernized and flexible
way to access DNS security (DNSSEC) and other powerful new DNS features;
a particular hope is to inspire application developers towards innovative
security solutions in their applications.
