***  !!! IMPORTANT !!!!  libgetdns needs a DNSSEC trust anchor!
***
***  For the library to be able to perform DNSSEC, the root
***  trust anchor needs to be present in presentation format
***  in the file:
***     %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/unbound/root.key
***
***  We recomend using unbound-anchor to retrieve and install
***  the root trust anchor like this:
***     su -m unbound -c /usr/local/sbin/unbound-anchor
***
