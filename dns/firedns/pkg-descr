libfiredns is a library for handling asynchronous DNS
requests.  It provides a very simple interface for sending
requests and parsing reponses, as well as low-timeout
blocking functions.  It can also be compiled to override
the BIND/LIBC functions with its alternative implementations.
libfiredns functions have much lower timeouts than the stock
functions and tend to be faster because they send requests
to all configured system nameservers at the same time.
