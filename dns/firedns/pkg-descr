libfiredns is a library for handling asynchronous DNS
requests.  It provides a very simple interface for sending
requests and parsing reponses, as well as low-timeout
blocking functions.  libfiredns functions have much lower
timeouts than the stock functions and tend to be faster
because they send requests to all configured system
nameservers at the same time.
