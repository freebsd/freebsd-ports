*   To run credns from startup, add credns_enable="YES"                  *
*   to your /etc/rc.conf                                                 *

*   Take good care when using credns commands, since they often need to  *
*   be executed as user dedicated to credns, in order for the files it   *
*   touches or creates to have the proper permissions.                   *
