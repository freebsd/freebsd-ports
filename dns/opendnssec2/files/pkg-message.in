# A manual migration step is needed to migration from 1.4 to 2.0.
#
# First migrate to at least the 1.4.10 release if you have not already done
# so.
#
# Review the documentation on the OpenDNSSEC site.  This can be
# updated in between releases to provide more help.  Especially if
# you have tooling around OpenDNSSEC you should be aware that some
# command line utilities have changed.  A fair amount of backward
# compatibility has been respected, but changes are present.
# 
# The enforcer does require a full migration, as the internal database has
# been completely revised.  See the documentation in 
# %%DOCSDIR%%/1.4-2.0_db_convert/README.md for a description.
# 
# Migration scripts are installed in %%DOCSDIR%%.
#
# The signer does not require any migration.  Backward compatibility is
# respected from earlier 1.4 release.  The signer should not require a
# full resign of your zone when upgrading, however if you decide to downgrade
# a full resign is required.
