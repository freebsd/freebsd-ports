 A manual migration step is needed to migration from 1.4 to 2.0.

 First migrate to at least the 1.4.10 release if you have not already done
 so.

 Review the documentation on the OpenDNSSEC site.  This can be
 updated in between releases to provide more help.  Especially if
 you have tooling around OpenDNSSEC you should be aware that some
 command line utilities have changed.  A fair amount of backward
 compatibility has been respected, but changes are present.
 
 The enforcer does require a full migration, as the internal database has
 been completely revised.  See the documentation in 
 %%DOCSDIR%%/1.4-2.0_db_convert/README.md for a description.
 
 Migration scripts are installed in %%DOCSDIR%%.

 The signer does not require any migration.  Backward compatibility is
 respected from earlier 1.4 release.  The signer should not require a
 full resign of your zone when upgrading, however if you decide to downgrade
 a full resign is required.
