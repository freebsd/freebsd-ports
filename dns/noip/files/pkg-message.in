You must have a registered host with No-IP (www.noip.com)
to use the noip Dynamic DNS Update Client (DUC).

You must also create the noip config file
/usr/local/etc/no-ip2.conf before using noip. To create the
configuration file, run as root:

/usr/local/bin/noip2 -C

You will be prompted to enter the Ethernet port that will be
associated with the host, your No-IP account name and
password, and the hostname you have registered with No-IP.
Your No-IP username and password are not stored, the
config file contains a unique key for the DUC to access the
No-IP DDNS service and only root has read permission.

If you are compiling from source using the ports tree, you
can also “make conf” to create the config file.

To run noip automatically at boot, add the following line
to /etc/rc.conf

noip_enable="YES"

Refer to the following for more information:

/usr/local/bin/noip2 --help
/usr/local/share/doc/noip/README.FIRST
