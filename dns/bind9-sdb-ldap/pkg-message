*	BIND 9 requires a good source of randomness to operate.		*
*	It also requires configuration of rndc, including a		*
*	"secret" key.  If you are using FreeBSD 4.x, visit		*
*	http://people.freebsd.org/~dougb/randomness.html for		*
*	information on how to set up entropy gathering. Users		*
*	of FreeBSD 5.x or later do not need to do this step. If		*
*	you are running BIND 9 in a chroot environment, make		*
*	sure that there is a /dev/random device in the chroot.		*
*									*
*	The easiest, and most secure way to configure rndc is		*
*	to run 'rndc-confgen -a' which will generate the proper		*
*	conf file, with a new random key, and appropriate file		*
*	permissions.							*
