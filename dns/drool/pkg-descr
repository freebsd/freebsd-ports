DNS Replay Tool (drool) can replay DNS traffic from packet capture
(PCAP) files and send it to a specified server, with options such
as to manipulate the timing between packets, as well as loop packets
infinitely or for a set number of iterations. This tool's goal is
to be able to produce a high amount of UDP packets per second and
TCP sessions per second on common hardware.
