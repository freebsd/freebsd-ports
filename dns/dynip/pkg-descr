dynip is a daemon that monitors your host system ISP assigned dynamic IP
address. If it changes, dynip automatically updates the dynamic DNS IP
address at your dynamic DNS hosting provider then posts an informational
message to the host system log followed by sending an informational email
to user root.

The dynip daemon and the daily script are very simple Bourne Shell type
scripts containing self documenting embedded comments. They use the
"fetch" command to issue the standard browser style URL format used by
most dynamic DNS hosting providers for the purpose of actual updating
the registered IP address with the new IP address. There are some small
variations in the URL format depending on the dynamic DNS hosting
provider being used.

Mandatory requirements. The host that is running dynip "MUST" be cabled
directly to the ISP modem and be using the public routable dynamic IP 
address assigned by the ISP.

Includes templates for these dynamic DNS hosting providers
     namecheap.com
     freedns.afraid.org
     changeip.com
     no-ip.com
     zoneedit.com
     easydns.com
and is simple to configure for other providers that use a variation
of the URL format.
