DNRD is a proxy name server. To clients on your home network,
it looks just like a name server. In reality, it forwards every
DNS query to the "real" DNS server, and forwards responses back
to the client.

So, why would you want to use it? DNRD was designed for home
networks where you might want to dial into more than one ISP
(ie, your home ISP and a dialup connection to your office). The
problem with multiple dialups is that you need to change
/etc/resolv.conf for each one. With DNRD, this is no longer
necessary.

Your dialup machine will run DNRD (with appropriate options for
forwarding messages to the desired DNS servers). All other
machines on the home network, including the dialup machine
itself, will use the dialup machine as its DNS server.
