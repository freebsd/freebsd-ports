DNRD is a proxy DNS daemon. It supports several forward servers for
redundancy and/or load-balancing. DNS queries for specific domains can
be forwarded to a specific group of DNS servers (with redundancy and
load balancing) for that domain. It is useful for VPNs and also good
support for offline and dialup sites.
