GResolver is a graphical DNS query tool using GTK+. It allows system
administrators to quickly and easily make the most common DNS queries
without constructing lengthy dig commands.

GResolver supports all the main resource record types, including AAAA,
AXFR, MX and TXT, and the appropriate in-addr.arpa address is
constructed from dotted-quad IP addresses when doing PTR
queries. There are checkboxes for controlling the most commonly-used
options.
