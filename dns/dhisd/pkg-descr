DHIS Daemon release 5.1
==============================

The server is now modular through the introduction of a services
sub-system. DNS updates are no longer part of the main code but
are now implemented as a module.

The main dhisd process listens to DHIS clients and after authentication
marks these with their dynamic IP address. The request is passed to a
sub-process through a pipe which implements the services for which the
client is subscribed to. Clients may be subscribed to one or more
services individually.
The sub-engine interface does a basic read from stdin and process.

Examples of things DHIS could update:
    Dns, Firewalls, tunnel servers, relay access lists, etc ...

For more information on the services of DHIS, you should look at the
