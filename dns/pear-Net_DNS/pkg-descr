A resolver library used to communicate with a name server to perform DNS
queries, zone transfers, dynamic DNS updates, etc.
Creates an object hierarchy from a DNS server response, which allows you to
view all of the information given by the DNS server. It bypasses the system
resolver library and communicates directly with the server.
