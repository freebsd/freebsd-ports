https_dns_proxy is light-weight DNS<->HTTPS, non-caching translation
proxy for the RFC 8484 DNS-over-HTTPS standard.  It receives regular
(UDP) DNS requests and issues them via DoH.

Using DNS over HTTPS makes eavesdropping and spoofing of DNS traffic
between you and the HTTPS DNS provider (Google/Cloudflare) much less
likely, of course so long as you trust your DoH provider.  Features:

  - Tiny size (<45kiB)
  - Uses cURL for HTTP/2 and pipelining, keeping resolve latencies
    extremely low
  - Single-threaded, non-blocking select() server for use on
    resource-starved embedded systems
  - Designed to sit in front of dnsmasq or similar caching resolver
    for transparent use
