unikmer is a golang package and a toolkit for nucleic acid k-mer analysis,
providing functions including set operation k-mers (sketch) optional with
TaxIds but without count information.

K-mers are either encoded (k<=32) or hashed (arbitrary k) into uint64, and
serialized in binary file with extension .unik.

TaxIds can be assigned when counting k-mers from genome sequences, and LCA
(Lowest Common Ancestor) is computed during set opertions including
computing union, intersecton, set difference, unique and repeated k-mers.
