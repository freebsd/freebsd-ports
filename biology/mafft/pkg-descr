MAFFT offers a range of multiple alignment strategies, L-INS-i
(accurate; recommended for <200 sequences), FFT-NS-i (standard speed and
accuracy), FFT-NS-2 (fast; recommended for >2,000 sequences), etc.
According to BAliBASE and other benchmark tests, L-INS-i is one of the
most accurate methods currently available.

MAFFT has been described:
