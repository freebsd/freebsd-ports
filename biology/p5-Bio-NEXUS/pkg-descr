Bio::NEXUS package provides an object-oriented, Perl-based
applications programming interface (API) to the NEXUS file
format of Maddison, et al., 1997 (Syst. Biol. 46:590-621).
NEXUS is a powerful and extensible format designed for use
in evolutionary analysis, including the analysis of molecular
sequence data as well as classical morphological and life-history
data. NEXUS is the input or output format for software such as
PAUP*, MacClade, Mesquite, SIMMAP, MrBayes, Nexplorer, and
so on.  This package also contains the demonstration applications
nexplot.pl (plot character data with a tree) and nextool.pl
(allowing programmatic editing, e.g., selecting particular
clades or subsets of data).
