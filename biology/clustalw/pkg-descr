               CLUSTAL W Multiple Sequence Alignment Program

ClustalW was written by Des Higgins (now at University College, Cork,
Ireland) (des@chah.ucc.ie), Julie Thompson (julie@IGBMC.u-strasbg.fr),
Toby Gibson, (Gibson@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE), and Franc'ois Jeanmougin
(pingouin@igbmc.u-strasbg.fr). It is a complete rewrite and upgrade of
the Clustal and ClustalV packages. which were developed by Des
Higgins. New features include the ability to detect read different
input formats (NBRF/PIR, Fasta, EMBL/Swissprot); align old alignments;
produce phylogenetic trees after alignment (Neighbor Joining trees
with a bootstrap option); write different alignment formats (Clustal,
NBRF/PIR, GCG, PHYLIP); full command line interface. It is described
in the following papers:
