TreeView X is program to display phylogenetic trees on Unix-like platforms.
It can read and display NEXUS and Newick format tree files (such as those
output by PAUP*, ClustalX, TREE-PUZZLE, and other programs). It has a
subset of the functionality of the version of TreeView available for the
Mac Classic and Windows (it is roughly equivalent to version 0.95 of
TreeView).
