Version 2 of the FASTA packages contains many programs for performing
sequence comparisons, producing local alignments, and other related tasks
for analysing DNA and proteins.

Currently, the FASTA2 suite is in maintenance mode.  This package provides
the analysis tools from FASTA2.  The searching programs are available in
version 3 of the FASTA packages, which may be found in the port
biology/fasta3.

FASTA is described in:  W. R. Pearson and D. J. Lipman (1988), "Improved
Tools for Biological Sequence Analysis", PNAS 85:2444- 2448, and W. R.
Pearson (1990) "Rapid and Sensitive Sequence Comparison with FASTP and FASTA"
Methods in Enzymology 183:63- 98).

The FASTA2 suite is distributed freely subject to the condition that it may
not be sold or incorporated into a commercial product.
