p5-Bio-MAGETAB contains the core MAGE-TAB Utilities Perl modules. This
is a beta release. All functions have now been implemented and most
have test suites; the exceptions include the modules involved in
export of MAGE-TAB documents, which are still a little experimental in
nature. The API is mostly finalised (and fully documented), but some
details may yet change where necessary to improve usability.
