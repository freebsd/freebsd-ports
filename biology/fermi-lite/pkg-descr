Fermi-lite is a standalone C library as well as a command-line tool for
assembling Illumina short reads in regions from 100bp to 10 million bp in size.
It is largely a light-weight in-memory version of fermikit without generating
any intermediate files. It inherits the performance, the relatively small memory
footprint and the features of fermikit. In particular, fermi-lite is able to
retain heterozygous events and thus can be used to assemble diploid regions for
the purpose of variant calling. It is one of the limited choices for local
re-assembly and arguably the easiest to interface.
