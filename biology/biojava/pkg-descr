The BioJava Project is an open-source project dedicated to providing Java
tools for processing biological data. This will include objects for
manipulating sequences, file parsers, CORBA interoperability, access to
ACeDB, dynamic programming, and simple statistical routines.

The BioJava library is useful for automating those daily and mundane
bioinformatics tasks. As the library matures, the BioJava libraries will
provide a foundation upon which both free software and commercial packages
can be developed.
