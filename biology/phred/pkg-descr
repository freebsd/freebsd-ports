Phred reads DNA sequencer trace data, calls bases, assigns quality values
to the bases, and writes the base calls and quality values to output files.

Trace data is read from chromatogram files in the SCF, ABI, and EST formats,
even if they were compressed using gzip, bzip2, or UNIX compress.
Quality values are written to FASTA format files or PHD files, which can be
used by the Phrap sequence assembly program in order to increase the accuracy
of the assembled sequence.

Base calling and quality value accuracies tested for:
  ABI models 373, 377, and 3700
  Molecular Dynamics MegaBACE
  LI-COR 4000

Base calling accuracies tested for:
  ABI model 3100
  Beckman CEQ

It contains also a data evaluation program called 'daev'.
