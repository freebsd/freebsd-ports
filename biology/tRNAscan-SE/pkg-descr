tRNAscan-SE was written in the PERL (version 5.0) script language.
Input consists of DNA or RNA sequences in FASTA format.  tRNA
predictions are output in standard tabular or ACeDB format.
tRNAscan-SE does no tRNA detection itself, but instead combines the
strengths of three independent tRNA prediction programs by negotiating
the flow of information between them, performing a limited amount of
post-processing, and outputting the results in one of several
formats.
