The wavefront alignment (WFA) algorithm is an exact gap-affine
algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the
sequences to accelerate the alignment process.  Unlike traditional
dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs
in time O(ns+s^2), proportional to the sequence length n and the
alignment score s, using O(s^2) memory (or O(s) using the
ultralow/BiWFA mode). Moreover, the WFA algorithm exhibits simple
computational patterns that the modern compilers can automatically
vectorize for different architectures without adapting the code.
