Recombine fits a model which has a single population of constant size with a
single recombination rate across all sites.  It can accomodate either plain
DNA or RNA data or SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data.

Recombine forms part of the Lamarc (Likelihood Analysis with Metropolis
Algorithm using Random Coalescence) suite.  See:
