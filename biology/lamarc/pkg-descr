LAMARC (Likelihood Analysis with Metropolis Algorithm using Random
Coalescence) is a package of programs for computing population parameters
such as population size, population growth rate and migration rates.  It does
this by using likelihoods for samples of data (sequences, microsatellites,
and electrophoretic polymorphisms) from populations.
