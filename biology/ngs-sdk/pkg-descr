NGS is a new, domain-specific API for accessing reads, alignments and pileups
produced from Next Generation Sequencing. The API itself is independent from any
particular back-end implementation, and supports use of multiple back-ends
simultaneously. It also provides a library for building new back-end "engines".
The engine for accessing SRA data is contained within the sister repository
ncbi-vdb.

The API is currently expressed in C++, Java and Python languages. The design
makes it possible to maintain a high degree of similarity between the code in
one language and code in another - especially between C++ and Java.
