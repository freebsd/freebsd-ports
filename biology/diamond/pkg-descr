DIAMOND is a BLAST-compatible local aligner for mapping protein and translated
DNA query sequences against a protein reference database (BLASTP and BLASTX
alignment mode). The speedup over BLAST is up to 20,000 on short reads at a
typical sensitivity of 90-99% relative to BLAST depending on the data and
settings.
