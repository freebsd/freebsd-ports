Read and write Generic Feature Format (GFF) with Biopython integration.

Generic Feature Format (GFF) is a biological sequence file format for
representing features and annotations on sequences. It is a tab delimited
format, making it accessible to biologists and editable in text editors and
spreadsheet programs. It is also well defined and can be parsed via automated
programs. GFF files are available from many of the large sequencing and
annotation centers.
