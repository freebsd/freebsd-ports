Pyrodigal is a Python module that provides bindings to Prodigal using Cython.

Features:
The library now features everything from the original Prodigal CLI:
* run mode selection: Choose between single mode, using a training sequence
  to count nucleotide hexamers, or metagenomic mode, using pre-trained data
  from different organisms (prodigal -p).
* region masking: Prevent genes from being predicted across regions
  containing unknown nucleotides (prodigal -m).
* closed ends: Genes will be identified as running over edges if they are
  larger than a certain size, but this can be disabled (prodigal -c).
* training configuration: During the training process, a custom translation
  table can be given (prodigal -g), and the Shine-Dalgarno motif search can
  be forcefully bypassed (prodigal -n)
* output files: Output files can be written in a format mostly compatible
  with the Prodigal binary, including the protein translations in FASTA
  format (prodigal -a), the gene sequences in FASTA format (prodigal -d),
  or the potential gene scores in tabular format (prodigal -s).
