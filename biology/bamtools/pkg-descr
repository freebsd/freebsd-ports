BamTools provides both a programmer's API and an end-user's toolkit for
handling BAM files.

BAM is the binary alternative to the sequence alignment/map (SAM) format used
for storing genetic sequence data. It uses BGZF block compression implemented
on top of the standard gzip file format to provide good compression while
allowing efficient random access for indexed queries.
