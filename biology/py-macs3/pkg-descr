MACS (Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq) is a tool for identifying
transcription factor (TF) binding sites.   Such sites are generated
by CHiP-Seq (CHromatin immuno-Precipitation sequencing) and ATAC-Seq
(Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin Sequencing).  MACS
identifies "peaks" in the genome sequence, which are areas enriched
in bound TFs or accessible chromatin.
