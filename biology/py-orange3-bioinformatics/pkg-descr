Orange Bioinformatics extends Orange, a data mining software package, with
common functionality for bioinformatics. The provided functionality can be
accessed as a Python library or through a visual programming interface (Orange
Canvas). The latter is also suitable for non-programmers.

Orange Bioinformatics provides access to publicly available data, like GEO data
sets, GO and KEGG. All features can be combined with powerful visualization,
network exploration and data mining techniques from the Orange data mining
framework.
