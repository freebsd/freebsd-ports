Visualizing the results of molecular orbital calculations
 1) MO program:  gaussian, gamess, mopac, etc.
 2) display molecule in 3D:  geo-opt, single-point, nomal mode (animation)
 3) density:  contour plot or 3D view for electron density and MO coefficient
Everything what you want about MO calculation can be seen.
