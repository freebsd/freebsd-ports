CoverM aims to be a configurable, easy to use and fast DNA read coverage and
relative abundance calculator focused on metagenomics applications.

CoverM calculates coverage of genomes/MAGs `coverm genome` or individual
contigs `coverm contig`. Calculating coverage by read mapping, its input can
either be BAM files sorted by reference, or raw reads and reference genomes
in various formats.
