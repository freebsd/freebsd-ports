ErmineJ performs analyses of gene sets in high-throughput genomics data such as
gene expression profiling studies. A typical goal is to determine whether
particular biological pathways are "doing something interesting" in an
experiment that generates long lists of candidates. The software is designed to
be used by biologists with little or no informatics background (but if you do,
you might be interested in the CLI or the R support).
