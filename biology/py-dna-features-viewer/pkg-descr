DNA Features Viewer is a Python library to visualize DNA features, e.g.
from GenBank or Gff files.

DNA Features Viewer can plot sequence maps linearly or circularly, with
or without nucleotide sequence and amino-acid sequences. The plotter
automatically produces clear plots even for sequences with many
overlapping features and long labels. The library plays well with
Matplotlib and Biopython, and the figures can be saved in different
formats (PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF), e.g. for report generation or LIMS
interfaces.
