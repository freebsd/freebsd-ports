ARIADNE is a package of two programs, ariadne and prospero, that compare
protein sequences and profiles using the Smith-Waterman algorithm, and
assesses statistical significance using a new accurate formula,
described in Mott, 2000, "Accurate Formula for P-values of gapped local
sequence and profile alignments" J. Mol Biol. 300:649-659.

The sequence/profile comparison algorithms used in ARIADNE are standard,
and are probably not the fastest implementations available. The novel
part is the method for determining statistical significance, which will
give thresholds of significance that are accurate to within 5% 95% of
the time.

The package is written in ANSI C. You are free to incorporate the method
used for assessing statistical significance into third-party code,
provided you cite the above reference. The routines for assessing
significance are all in gaplib.c
