The EMBOSS suite has been successfully installed.

In order to see graphical output from some EMBOSS programs, you will need to
set the following environment variable in your shell startup file:

- set PLPLOT_LIB to:     "%%PREFIX%%/share/EMBOSS"

NB:  A sample configuration file has been installed to %%PREFIX%%/etc as
emboss.default.sample.  This must be renamed to emboss.default and edited
to suit your site and its requirements.

A .embossrc in a user's home directory overrides settings in the
system-wide emboss.default.
