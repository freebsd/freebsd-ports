cat << EOM

Prefixing \$PATH with $emboss_bin.

Emboss contains commands that conflict with other tools, including at least
"charge", "cons", "garnier", "prophet", and "tcode".

The other commands with these names may serve entirely different functions
and will not be accessible while running this shell unless you refer to them
by their absolute path name (e.g. %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/garnier), which is not
portable, BTW, so don't hard-code such paths into your scripts.

Type "exit" or "Ctrl+D" to return to your normal shell.
