 The EMBOSS suite has been successfully installed under
 %%PREFIX%%

 To run EMBOSS programs make sure that %%PREFIX%%/bin is in your PATH.

 In order to see graphical output from some EMBOSS programs, you will
 need to set the following environment variable in your shell:

 set PLPLOT_LIB to: "%%PREFIX%%/share/EMBOSS"

 A sample configuration file has been installed in
 %%DATADIR%%/emboss.default.template

 This must be renamed to emboss.default and edited to suit your site
 and requirements.

 A .embossrc file in a user's home directory overrides settings in the
 system-wide emboss.default.

 Additional third party applications for EMBOSS can be installed from the
 biology/embassy port. Remember, though that if you installed EMBOSS in a
 PREFIX other than the default, you will have to install EMBASSY into this
 same PREFIX.
