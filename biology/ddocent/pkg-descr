dDocent is simple bash wrapper to QC, assemble, map, and call SNPs from almost
any kind of RAD sequencing. If you have a reference already, dDocent can be
used to call SNPs from almost any type of NGS data set. It is designed to run
on Linux based machines with large memory capacity and multiple processing
cores, and it can be modified for use on HPC.
