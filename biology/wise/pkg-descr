"Wise2 is package that is focused on comparing DNA sequences at
the level of its conceptual translation, regardless of sequencing
error and introns. This really is a rewrite of the old wisetools
package, which I wrote about 3 years ago.

It can compare a single protein or a profile HMM to a genomic DNA
sequence, and predict a gene structure. This is algorithm, called
genewise, is one of the algorithms available in Wise2. There are
other algorithms focused on EST data rather than genomic data, as
well as some other algorithm curios."
