Welcome to Wise2.2

You must set your WISECONFIGDIR to the config directory before
using the programs:

in (t)csh:  setenv WISECONFIGDIR PREFIX/share/wise/
in (ba)sh:  export WISECONFIGDIR=PREFIX/share/wise/

To try an example:

cd PREFIX/share/examples/wise
genewise road.pep human.genomic

[Replace 'PREFIX' above with the actual installation prefix,
which by default is '/usr/local'.]
