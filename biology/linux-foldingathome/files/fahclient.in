# Some notes on the specified options:
# - fahclient_flags are passed in before other options by the rc
#   framework.
# - --user sets the donor work units are attributed to (config file takes
#   precedence).
# - --team sets the team work units are attributed to (cfg file takes
#   precedence).
# - --config is necessary to point the program to the correct configuration
#   file.
# - --log sets the log file location (takes precedence over config file),
#   log is special in this respect.
# - --chdir is used to switch to a desired work directory. The program is going
#   to create a lot of files in its current working directory so should not be
#   just any directory on the system.
# - --pid-file specifies the location for the PID file.
# - --daemon is to detach the program from the terminal and run it
#   in the background.
# - fahclient_extra_flags are passed in after all other options.
