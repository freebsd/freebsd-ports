Quick start
===========

Here is a list of steps to quickly get started with Folding@home on FreeBSD:

1.	Mount linprocfs(5) in /compat/linux/proc.

2.	Mount linsysfs(5) in /compat/linux/sys.

3.	Enable the fahclient service:

		sysrc fahclient_enable=YES

4.	Consider setting Folding@home donor name and team ID:

		sysrc fahclient_donor=my_fah_username
		sysrc fahclient_team=0

	Team 0 means "no team", by default fahclient joins team FreeBSD
	(11743).

5.	Start the service:

		service fahclient start

At this point, the daemon should be up and folding.

Additional notes
================

-	The current status of folding can be inspected by running
	the following command:

		service fahclient log

-	The default working directory for fahclient is %%FAHCLIENT_WORK_DIR%%.
	In order to function properly, fahclient requires its working directory
	to be on a partition/dataset with execute permissions on.  For example
	if /var/db is on a ZFS dataset with exec=off, then %%FAHCLIENT_WORK_DIR%%
	needs to have exec=on.

	Note, that usually the permissions are on unless the system
	configuration was modified by the administrator.

-	By default the FreeBSD team (team id 11743) is joined.
	This can be overridden by changing the configuration in rc.conf:

		sysrc fahclient_team=0

	The service has to be restarted to pick up the change.

	Statistics for the FreeBSD team can be viewed here:
	https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/11743

-	Team and donor configuration values in %%FAHCLIENT_CONFIG_XML%% take
	precedence over those configured in rc.conf using sysrc.

-	It's possible to specify additional flags in rc.conf. Those take
	precedence over what is configured in the config file, e.g., setting
	the maximum number of cpus to be used:

		sysrc fahclient_flags+=" --cpus=7"

	Flags that are set this way will be overridden by settings in
	%%FAHCLIENT_CONFIG_XML%%. You can set fahclient_extra_flags
	to override settings in %%FAHCLIENT_CONFIG_XML%%:

		sysrc fahclient_extra_flags+=" --cpus=7"

-	You can check the actual configuration values applied with:

		service fahclient showconfig

-	More information about configuring and running the Folding@home
	software is available on those websites:
