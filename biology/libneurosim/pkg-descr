libneurosim is a general library that provides interfaces and common utility
code for neuronal simulators.

Currently it provides the ConnectionGenerator interface.

The ConnectionGenerator API is a standard interface supporting efficient
generation of network connectivity during model setup in neuronal network
simulators. It is intended as an abstraction isolating both sides of the API:
any simulator can use a given connection generator and a given simulator can use
any library providing the ConnectionGenerator interface. It was initially
developed to support the use of libcsa from NEST.
