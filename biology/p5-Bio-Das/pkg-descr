Bio::Das provides access to genome sequencing and annotation databases
that export their data in Distributed Annotation System (DAS) format
version 1.5.  This system is described at http://biodas.org.  Both
unencrypted (http:) and SSL-encrypted (https:) DAS servers are sup-
ported.  (To run SSL, you will need IO::Socket::SSL and Net::SSLeay
installed).
