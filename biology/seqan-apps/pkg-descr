SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms
and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the
focus on biological data. 

This port contains applications built on SeqAn and developed
within the SeqAn project. Among them are famous read mappers
like RazerS and Yara, as well as many other tools. Some
applications are packaged seperately and the library
can be found at biology/seqan.
