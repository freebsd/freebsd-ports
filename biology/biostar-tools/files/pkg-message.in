Biostar-tools installs all of the tools except emboss to the
default PATH (normally /usr/local/bin) so they just work without any
special environment.  Emboss commands are installed to
%%PREFIX%%/emboss/bin due to conflicts with other packages.  Run
"biostar-shell" to add the emboss commands to your PATH, and simply
exit the shell to return your PATH to normal.
