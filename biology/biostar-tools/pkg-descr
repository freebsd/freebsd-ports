Biostar-Tools is a metaport for installing all the tools necessary to
work through the Biostar Handbook, except for bedGrapToBigWig, which
has license restrictions.  If you need bedGraphToBigWig, run

	cd /usr/ports/biology/ucsc-userapps && make install clean

The handbook instructs the reader to install these tools mostly via
bioconda, which then requires the user to activate the bioconda
environment each time they want to use the tools.  You can also
install conda packages on FreeBSD if you wish.  For details, see

	/usr/ports/sysutils/linux-miniconda-installer/pkg-descr

This meta-package installs all of the tools except emboss to the
default PATH (normally /usr/local/bin) so they just work without any
special environment.  Emboss commands are installed to
/usr/local/emboss/bin due to conflicts with other packages.  Run
"biostar-shell" to add the emboss commands to your PATH, and simply
exit the shell to return your PATH to normal.
