IQ-TREE is efficient and versatile phylogenomic software, created as the
successor of IQPNNI and TREE-PUZZLE (thus the name IQ-TREE).  Development was
motivated by the rapid accumulation of phylogenomic data, leading to a need for
efficient phylogenomic software that can handle a large amount of data and
provide more complex models of sequence evolution. To this end, IQ-TREE can
utilize multicore computers and distributed parallel computing to speed up the
analysis. IQ-TREE automatically performs checkpointing to resume an interrupted
analysis.

As input IQ-TREE accepts all common sequence alignment formats including PHYLIP,
FASTA, Nexus, Clustal and MSF. As output IQ-TREE will write a self-readable
report file (name suffix .iqtree), a NEWICK tree file (.treefile) which can be
visualized by tree viewer programs such as FigTree, Dendroscope or iTOL.
