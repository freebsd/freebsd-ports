BioSig is an open source software library for biomedical signal processing,
featuring for example the analysis of biosignals such as the
electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocorticogram (ECoG), electrocardiogram (ECG),
electrooculogram (EOG), electromyogram (EMG), respiration, and so on. Major
application areas are: Neuroinformatics, brain-computer interfaces,
neurophysiology, psychology, cardiovascular systems and sleep research. The aim
of the BioSig project is to foster research in biomedical signal processing by
providing open source software tools for many different applications.
