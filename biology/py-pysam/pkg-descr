pysam is a lightweight wrapper of the htslib C-API and provides facilities to
read and write SAM/BAM/VCF/BCF/BED/GFF/GTF/FASTA/FASTQ files as well as access
to the command line functionality of the samtools and bcftools packages. The
module supports compression and random access through indexing.

This module provides a low-level wrapper around the htslib C-API as using
cython and a high-level API for convenient access to the data within standard
genomic file formats.
