PyCogent is a software library for genomic biology. It is a fully integrated
and thoroughly tested framework for: controlling third-party applications;
devising workflows; querying databases; conducting novel probabilistic
analyses of biological sequence evolution; and generating publication quality
graphics. It is distinguished by many unique built-in capabilities (such as
true codon alignment) and the frequent addition of entirely new methods for
the analysis of genomic data.
