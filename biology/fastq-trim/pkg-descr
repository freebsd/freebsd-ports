Fastq-trim is a lightening fast read trimming tool for QA of
DNA and RNA reads prior to analyses such as RNA-Seq.  it runs
in a fraction of the time required by popular trimmers and uses
only a few megabytes of RAM, so it will run almost entirely in
cache.  The design supports adding any number of alignment
functions, so it can be easily adapted to any trimming needs.
