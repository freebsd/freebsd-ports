GKL is a set of optimized versions of compute kernels used in genomics
applications like GATK and HTSJDK.

Kernels included:
* PairHMM
     AVX and AVX-512 optimized versions of PairHMM used in GATK
     HaplotypeCaller and MuTect2.
     OpenMP support for multicore processors.
* Smith-Waterman
     AVX2 and AVX-512 optimized versions of Smith-Waterman used in GATK
     HaplotypeCaller and MuTect2.
* DEFLATE Compression/Decompression:
     Performance optimized Level 1 and 2 compression and decompression
     from Intel's ISA-L library.
     Performance optimized Level 3 through 9 compression from Intel's
     Open Source Technology Center zlib library.
* Partially Determined HMM (PDHMM)
     AVX2 and AVX-512 optimized versions of PDHMM used in GATK.
     Serial Implementation for CPU's with no AVX.
