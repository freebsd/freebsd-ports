Bio::Glite is an interface to G-language Genome Analysis Environment
through its REST web service (http://www.g-language.org). This module
allows almost everything G-language GAE can do, without installing
all necessary tookits and modules.

Advantage of this module over the standard installation of
G-language GAE package is:
   1. Easy installation from CPAN
   2. Extremely light-weight (less than 1000 lines of code)
   3. Does not require much CPU/RAM (all calculation is done on
the cloud)

Disadvantages includes:
   1. Slower analysis speed
   2. Internet connection is required
   3. No other software interfaces such as the G-language Shell
