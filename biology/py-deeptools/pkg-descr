deepTools contains useful modules to process the mapped reads data for
multiple quality checks, creating normalized coverage files in standard
bedGraph and bigWig file formats, that allow comparison between
different files (for example, treatment and control). Finally, using
such normalized and standardized files, deepTools can create many
publication-ready visualizations to identify enrichments and for
functional annotations of the genome.
