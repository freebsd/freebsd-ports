PLINK/SEQ is an open-source C/C++ library for working with human
genetic variation data. The specific focus is to provide a platform
for analytic tool development for variation data from large-scale
resequencing and genotyping projects, particularly whole-exome and
whole-genome studies. It is independent of (but designed to be
complementary to) the existing PLINK package.
