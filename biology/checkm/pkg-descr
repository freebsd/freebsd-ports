CheckM provides a set of tools for assessing the quality of genomes recovered
from isolates, single cells, or metagenomes. It provides robust estimates of
genome completeness and contamination by using collocated sets of genes that
are ubiquitous and single-copy within a phylogenetic lineage. Assessment of
genome quality can also be examined using plots depicting key genomic
characteristics (e.g., GC, coding density) which highlight sequences outside
the expected distributions of a typical genome. CheckM also provides tools for
identifying genome bins that are likely candidates for merging based on marker
set compatibility, similarity in genomic characteristics, and proximity within
a reference genome tree.
