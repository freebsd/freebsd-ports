GRAPPA: Genome Rearrangements Analysis under Parsimony and other
Phylogenetic Algorithms

This suite of programs implements the approach to phylogeny
reconstruction from gene orders described in the paper
   Moret, B.M.E., Wyman, S., Bader, D.A., Warnow, T., and Yan, M.,
   ``A detailed study of breakpoint analysis,''
   Proc. 6th Pacific Symp. Biocomputing PSB 2001, Hawaii (2001).
In its current state, "grappa" allows one to explore either the
space of all possible trees on n labelled leaves or the space of all
such trees that obey (are refinements of) a particular constraint tree.

"invdist" takes the first two genomes in the input file and returns
their inversion distance.
"distmat" prints the inversion and breakpoint distance matrices.
