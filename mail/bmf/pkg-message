=== How to integrate bmf ===
============================

For maildrop(1), use only one of the following examples.  The first
sample invokes bmf in its normal mode of operation and the second
invokes bmf as a filter:

	### Sample One
	# Invoke bmf and use return code to filter spam in one step
	exception {
		`bmf`
		if ( $RETURNCODE == 0 )
			to $MAILDIR/spam
	}

	### Sample Two
	# Invoke bmf as a filter
	exception {
		xfilter "bmf -p"
		if (/^X-Spam-Status: Yes/)
			to $MAILDIR/spam
	}


For procmail(1), use only one of the following samples.  SPAM will be
filtered into $MAILDIR/spam.  The first sample invokes bmf in its
normal mode of operation and the second invokes bmf as a filter.

	### begin sample one ###
	# Invoke bmf and use return code to filter spam in one step
	:0HB
	* ? bmf
	| formail -A"X-Spam-Status: Yes, tests=bmf" >>$MAILDIR/spam

	### begin sample two ###
	# Invoke bmf as a filter
	:0 fw
	| bmf -p

	# Filter spam
	:0:
	^X-Spam-Status: Yes
	$MAILDIR/spam

If you put bmf in your maildrop or procmail scripts as suggested
above, it will always register an email as either spam or non-spam.
To reverse this registration and train bmf, the following mutt macros
may be useful:

  macro index \ed "<enter-command>unset wait_key\n<pipe-entry>bmf -S\n<enter-command>set wait_key\n<save-message>=spam\n" "Tags a given message as SPAM"
  macro index \et "<pipe-entry>bmf -t\n<enter-command>set wait_key\n" "Tests a given message to see if it is SPAM"
  macro index \eu "<pipe-entry>bmf -N\n<enter-command>set wait_key\n<save-message>=inbox\n" "Untags a given message as SPAM"

These will override these commands:

  <Esc>d = de-register as non-spam, register as spam, and move to spam folder.
  <Esc>t = test for spamicity.
  <Esc>u = de-register as spam, register as non-spam, and move to inbox folder.

Please see the ${PREFIX}/share/bmf/README for further details.
