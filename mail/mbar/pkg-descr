Mbar scans the given mailbox folder mailboxes matching a supplied pattern.
For each mailbox found, a set of criteria is applied to its messages.  All
messages that matched the criteria are then picked and moved to the mailbox
of the same name, located in the backup folder.  If the destination mailbox
does not exist, it is created with the necessary intermediate directories.
