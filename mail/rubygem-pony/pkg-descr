The express way to send mail from Ruby.

Send email in one command:
Pony.mail(:to => 'someone@example.com', :body => 'hello')

Pony uses /usr/sbin/sendmail to send mail if it
is available, otherwise it uses SMTP to localhost.

Also, you may need rubygem-smtp_tls if you want to
send via tls/ssl and are using ruby < 1.8.7
