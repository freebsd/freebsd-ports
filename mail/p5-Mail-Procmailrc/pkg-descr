Mail::Procmailrc is a pure Perl module that can read and write
procmail(1) compatible rc files. The intent behind its creation was
to provide an abstracted interface for web clients wishing to edit
procmailrc files, but it could be used in any number of useful ways
(e.g., a procmail rc pretty printer--how useful is that!?).

Mail::Procmailrc does not process mail in any form; it only reads and
writes procmail(1) rc files.
