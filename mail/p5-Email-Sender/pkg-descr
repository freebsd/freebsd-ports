Email::Sender replaces the old and sometimes problematic Email::Send library,
which did a decent job at handling very simple email sending tasks, but was not
suitable for serious use, for a variety of reasons.

Most users will be able to use Email::Sender::Simple to send mail. Users with
more specific needs should look at the available Email::Sender::Transport
classes.

Documentation may be found in Email::Sender::Manual, and new users should start
with Email::Sender::Manual::QuickStart.

This module provides a very simple, very clean, very specific interface
to multiple Email mailers.  The goal of this software is to be small
and simple, easy to use, and easy to extend.
