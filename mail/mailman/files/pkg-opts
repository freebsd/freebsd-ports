* MM_USERNAME [mailman]
  The username of the Mailman user

* MM_USERID [92]
  The user ID of the Mailman user

    It is recommended that you do not change this option.

* MM_GROUPNAME [mailman]
  The group to which the Mailman user will belong

* MM_GROUPID [92]
  The group ID for the Mailman user

    It is recommended that you do not change this option.

* MM_DIR [mailman]
  Mailman will be installed in ${PREFIX}/${MM_DIR}

* MAIL_GID [mailnull]
  The group name or id under which your MTA performs mail delivery

    Getting the value of MAIL_GID right is crucial to getting Mailman to work
    with your MTA.  By default this port works with sendmail.  If you're
    using an alternative MTA installed from ports, you should set MAIL_GID at
    build time according to the following table.  You may use either the
    group name or the numerical GID.  (Please contact this port's maintainer
    if you wish to fill in the blanks or report mistakes!)

    ----------------------------------------------------
    MTA     | MAIL_GID       | Submitted by
    Exim3   | nobody (65534) | <wjv@FreeBSD.org>
    Exim4   | mail   (6)     | <wjv@FreeBSD.org>
    Postfix | nobody (65534) | <shamrock@cypherpunks.to>
    Qmail   | ???            |
    ----------------------------------------------------

* CGI_GID [www]
  The group name or id under which your web server executes CGI scripts

    By default, this port works with the current port of Apache2.  If your
    WWW server executes CGI scripts under a different GID, you'll have to
    set this at build time.

* IMGDIR [www/icons]
  Icon images will be installed in ${PREFIX}/${IMGDIR}

* WITH_APACHE13 [undefined]
  If defined, port depends on Apache 1.3.x instead of 2.x

* WITH_CHINESE [undefined]
  Define to include support for Chinese mailing lists
