Mailman has been installed, but requires further configuration before use!

You also must configure both your MTA (mail server) and web server to
integrate with Mailman.  If the port's documentation has been installed,
extensive post-installation instructions may be found in:

  %%DOCSDIR%%/FreeBSD-post-install-notes
  %%DOCSDIR%%/mailman-install.txt (start at section 4)

Note (1): 
- ESPECIALLY RELEVANT FOR USERS OF THE BINARY PACKAGE -
The FreeBSD binary package is built for use with Sendmail, and it will
not work properly with alternative MTAs such as Exim or Postfix.
  In order for Mailman to work with an alternative mailer,
the port must be installed from source, with proper options configured,
or from a package built in poudriere (which is a separate port in
ports-mgmt) with adapted options. (poudriere options -cn mail/mailman)

- FOR USERS OF A PORT BUILT FROM SOURCE -
If you use an alternate MTA (meaning "not Sendmail"), you MUST
be sure that the correct value of MAIL_GID was used when this port or
package was built.  You can choose your MTA with the correct MAIL_GID by
running "make config" in the Mailman port's directory.

Note (2):  The entire Mailman installation resides under %%MAILMANDIR%%.
The command-line scripts necessary to administer Mailman have been
installed in %%MAILMANDIR%%/bin.

In order to make private archives searchable with namazu2, you need
to copy or link %%LOCALBASE%%/libexec/namazu.cgi to
%%MAILMANDIR%%/archives/private/<ML_name>/ and configure .namazurc.
Refer to %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/namazu/namazurc.sample.

  message: <<EOM
If you did just install mailman with pkg -I, --no-script or
--no-install-scripts, you MUST(!) run the post-install script now, as root:

env "PKG_PREFIX=%%PREFIX%%" sh \
    %%MAILMANDIR%%/bin/FreeBSD-post-install x POST-INSTALL

This will set up most defaults (cron jobs, default configuration etc.).

{ type: upgrade
  maximum_version: 2.1.18
  message <<EOM
UPDATE INFORMATION FOR UPDATES OF 2.1.18/OLDER TO VERSION 2.1.19 AND NEWER:

  Changed behavior

    - Mailman's log files, request.pck files and heldmsg-* files are no
      longer created world readable to protect against access by untrusted
      local users.  Note that permissions on existing log files won't be
      changed so if you are concerned about this and don't rotate logs or
      have a logrotate process that creates new log files instead of letting
      Mailman create them, you will need to address that.  (LP: #1327404)

The mailman newsyslog.conf(5) filename has been changed:
  OLD: %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/mailman.newsyslog
  NEW: %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/mailman.conf

Any file found at the old location has been automatically moved to
the new location. This was done to ensure log rotation continues to
work after change r340318 made to FreeBSD base, where the default
newsyslog configuration now only includes filenames that end with
'.conf' and do not begin with '.'.

If you use provisioning/configuration management tools to create or
edit this file, you will need to change their configuration to use
the new filename.
