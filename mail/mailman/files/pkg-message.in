Mailman has been installed, but requires further configuration before use!

You will have to configure both your MTA (mail server) and web server to
integrate with Mailman.  If the port's documentation has been installed,
extensive post-installation instructions may be found in:

  %%DOCSDIR%%/FreeBSD-post-install-notes

Note (1):  If you use an alternate MTA (meaning "not Sendmail"), you MUST
be sure that the correct value of MAIL_GID was used when this port or
package was built.  You can choose your MTA with the correct MAIL_GID by
running "make config" in the Mailman port directory.

Note (2):  The entire Mailman installation resides under %%MAILMANDIR%%.
The command-line scripts necessary to administer Mailman have been
installed in %%MAILMANDIR%%/bin.

Note (3):  As of version 2.1, Mailman's queue runner runs as a daemon and
is started by a script in %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d

In order to make private archives searchable with namazu2, you need copy
or link %%LOCALBASE%%/libexec/namazu.cgi to
%%MAILMANDIR%%/archives/private/<ML_name>/ and configure .namazurc
to refer to %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/namazu/namazu-sample.
