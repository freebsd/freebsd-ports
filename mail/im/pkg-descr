IM (Internet Message) provides a series of user interface commands
(imput, imget, imls, ...) and backend Perl5 modules to integrate
E-mail and NetNews user interface. They are designed to be used both
from Mew version 1.x and on command line.

The folder style of IM is exactly the same as that of MH. So, you can
replace MH with this package without any migration works. Moreover,
you are able to operate your messages both by IM and MH with
consistent manner.

Although you installed IM successfully, yet you must be initialized on
your home directory at once. Execute imsetup command with your account
after im installed.
