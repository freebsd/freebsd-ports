This package provides a series of user interface commands (im*
commands) and backend Perl5 libraries to integrate Email and NetNews
user interface. They are designed to be used both from Mew and on
command line.

The folder style for Mew is exactly the same as that of MH. So, you
can replace MH with this package without any migration
works. Moreover, you are able to operate your messages both by IM and
MH with consistent manner.

All programs/libraries conforms GPL2. This means, in short words, free
but no warranty. You have to provide whole source code if you
distribute. 

Although you installed IM successfully, yet you must be initialized on
your home directory at once. Execute imsetup command with your account
after im installed.
