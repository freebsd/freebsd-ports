MailScanner is a complete e-mail security system designed for use on 
e-mail gateways. It protects against viruses, and detects attacks against 
e-mail client packages (such as Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora). It can 
also detect almost all unsolicited commercial e-mail (spam) passing through 
it and respond to all incidents in a wide variety of ways. 

Not only can it scan for known viruses, but it can also protect against unknown 
viruses hidden inside e-mail attachments by refusing entry to attachments whose 
filenames match any given pattern. This can include generic patterns that trap 
filenames attempting to hide the true filename extension (e.g. ".txt.vbs"). 

It is superior to many commercial packages in its ability to handle attacks 
against itself, such as Denial Of Service attacks caused by messages containing
the "Zip of Death". It is easy to install into an existing e-mail gateway, 
requiring very little knowledge of sendmail and no change to an existing 
sendmail configuration. 

MailScanner itself is entirely open source, but it uses widely known commercial
virus scanning packages at its core. The other software it uses is all high 
quality open source software, leading to a system that can be trusted for 
performance and reliability.
