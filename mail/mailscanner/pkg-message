	See %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/MailScanner/README.FreeBSD.port,
	http://www.mailscanner.info, the man pages MailScanner and
	MailScanner.conf for further instructions.

	You will need to make several modifications to config files
	before MailScanner will work correctly.
                                              
	If this is the first time you are installing this port you
	should create an initial set of configuration files with 
                                                               
	make initial-config 

	within this directory. Without this step you will only have
	.sample files instead of real .conf files and report
	templates.

	If you are upgrading your port you might consider 
	running

	make renew-wrapper
	make renew-autoupdate
	make renew-reports

	to update your virus-wrappers, autoupdates, reports and
	languages.conf

	Sophos users: Please take a look at the Sophos install
	script %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/MailScanner/Sophos.install.freebsd
