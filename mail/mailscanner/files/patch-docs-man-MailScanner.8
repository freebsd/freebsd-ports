 .SH "MTA SETUP"
 .LP 
 It is important that your MTA only queues incoming mail and does not deliver it automatically. You need two mail queues (incoming and outgoing). Moreover you should setup two instances of your MTA. One that accepts incoming mail and puts it to an incoming queue and one that sends out mail that resides in the outgoing queue.
