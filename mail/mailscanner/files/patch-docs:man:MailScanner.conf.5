 If more messages are found in the queue than this, then switch to an "accelerated" mode of processing messages. This will cause it to stop scanning messages in strict date order, but in the order it finds them in the queue. If your queue is bigger than this size a lot of the time, then some messages could be greatly delayed. So treat this option as "in emergency only".

+You may not want to receive mail from certain addresses and/or to certain addresses. If so, you can do this with your email transport (sendmail, Postfix, etc) but that will just send a one\-line message which is not helpful to the user sending the message. If this is set to yes, then the message set by the "Rejection Report" will be sent instead, and the incoming message will be deleted. If you want to store a copy of the original incoming message then use the "Archive Mail" setting to archive a copy of it. The purpose of this option is to set it to be a ruleset, so that you can reject messages from a few offending addresses where you need to  send a polite reply instead of just a brief 1\-line rejection message.

 There is no point quarantining most viruses these days, so if you set this to "no" then no infections listed in your "Silent Viruses" setting will be quarantined, even if you have chosen to quarantine infections in general. This is currently set to "yes" so the behaviour is the same as it was in in previous versions. This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
