- From this version on all ports will contain this Change Log.
- The following scripts are now installed by the port as well (into
  /usr/local/libexec/MailScanner):
	- analyse_SpamAssassin_cache
	- clean.SA.cache (use this for manual clean or in crontab)
	- clean.quarantine (use this for manual clean or in crontab)
	- update_phishing_sites (use this for manual updates)
	- update_phishing_sites.cron (use this in crontab)
	- update_virus_scanners.cron (ise this in crontab)
- The latter two can/should be used in your crontab for updating those
  components. These scripts introduce a random delay for updating (can
  be configured in rc.conf).

  always working.
