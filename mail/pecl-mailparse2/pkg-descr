Mailparse is an extension for parsing and working with email messages.
It can deal with rfc822 and rfc2045 (MIME) compliant messages.
Mailparse is stream based, which means that it does not keep in-memory
copies of the files it processes - so it is very resource efficient
when dealing with large messages.
