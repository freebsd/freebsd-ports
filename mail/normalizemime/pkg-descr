[ excerpt from developer's www site with modifications ]

This is a mime email message parser to be used as a preprocessor
for email classification software.

Tries to normalize the content to 8bit encoding with utf-8 character
set. Also appends a copy of message body with HTML removed (IMG and
A tags remain unaffected).
