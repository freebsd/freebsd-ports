pizauth is a simple program for requesting, showing, and refreshing OAuth2
access tokens. pizauth is formed of two components: a persistent server which
interacts with the user to request tokens, and refreshes them as necessary; and
a command-line interface which can be used by programs such as fdm, neomutt, or
msmtp to authenticate with OAuth2.
