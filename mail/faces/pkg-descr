Faces is a Gtk+ program for monitoring a list visually. Typically this is
a list of incoming mail messages. IMAP and POP mailbox formats are
supported.

Faces has three different modes of operation:
* The default will monitor for new mail.
* You can monitor the whole of a mail file.
* Custom monitoring. You can specify a program or shell script to run.

Lots of good examples can be downloaded from:

Audio capabilities are also provided as a conditional compilation option.
