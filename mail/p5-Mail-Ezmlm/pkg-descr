Ezmlm.pm

Object methods for ezmlm mailing lists.

This software is beta release. As such, please treat it with the appropriate 
amount of caution. Let me know if you find any bugs, etc.

The main reason for release is to sort of 'test the waters' ... Does anyone
apart from me think this is a good idea??

Install by doing the following ...
# perl Makefile.PL
# make test
# make install

One thing. For some reason MakeMaker doesn't like symlinks. Please make sure
you use the full cantonical path for the qmail and ezmlm binaries.

Documentation is in pod format. Please run perldoc Mail::Ezmlm after you have
installed it.
