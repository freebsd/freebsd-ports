POPFile is an automatic mail classification tool. Once properly set up
and trained, it will scan all email as it arrives and classify it based
on your training. You can give it a simple job, like separating out junk
e-mail, or a complicated one -- like filing mail into a dozen folders.
Think of it as a personal assistant for your inbox.

Since v0.21.0, POPFile supports multiple user with a single instance.
Using ${LOCALDIR}/sbin/popfile.sh, you can start your own POPFile
easily; it uses ${HOME}/.popfile as a working directory.

Note for old POPFile users: copy messages/ and corpus/ directory to your
${HOME}/.popfile directory (if not, create it), then start popfile.sh.
