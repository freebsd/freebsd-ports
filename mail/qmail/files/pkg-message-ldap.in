	ATTENTION:

Please make sure that you read %%PREFIX%%/doc/PORT_NOTES.
It contains important information about testing and configuring
qmail, and finally replacing sendmail with qmail.

You should also add %%PREFIX%%/man to your MANPATH (see manpath(1)
or login.conf(5)).

Do not forget to read %%PREFIX%%/doc/QLDAPINSTALL. After all,
this is NOT our old stock qmail. And, %%PREFIX%%/doc/ANTISPAM
for some antispam control measures.

You can enable qmail as your default mailer executing:
> %%PREFIX%%/scripts/enable-qmail

=====><=====

If you've built this port with TLS support (WITH_TLS=yes)

==> You will need to provide a working certificate in %%PREFIX%%/control/cert.pem :

# makes a self-signed certificate
3) do "make certificate"

# makes a certificate request
4) do "make certificate-req"

Now, you need to use it. Check a little FreeBSD specific how-to at
