This text was originally taken from the qmail INSTALL file that you
will find in /var/qmail/doc/.  In addition to INSTALL, there are many
other potentially important qmail documents there.

As with all ports, the ports maintainer (me!) makes NO WARRANTIES of
any kind: expressed, implied, or other; about the reliability or
security of this package.  Any damage or problems derived from its
usage or related to it are neither my responsibility nor the software
author's.  This package is provided AS IS.

Although I am probably sounding cold and harsh, believe me: qmail is
one of the most reliable and easy-to-use softwares around.  However,
this also is NOT a WARRANTY.  It is just an opinion.  :)

The qmail port will normally install into /var/qmail/.  If you changed
this to /usr/local/, then please note that the docs have been
installed into /usr/local/share/doc/qmail/ (as opposed to
/usr/local/doc/).

If you wish to rerun the automatic configuration utility, do:

# cd /var/qmail/configure ; ./config

If you are upgrading from a previous version of qmail, you should read
/var/qmail/doc/UPGRADE and follow all the steps after #6.


[from /var/qmail/doc/INSTALL]

SAVE COPIES OF YOUR OUTGOING MAIL! Like any other piece of software (and
information generally), the qmail system comes with NO WARRANTY. It's
much more secure and reliable than sendmail, but that's not saying much.

[pre-build instructions elided]

To create /var/qmail and configure qmail (won't interfere with sendmail):

[#1 - #3 elided]

 4. Read INSTALL.ctl and FAQ. Minimal survival command:
       # ./config

[The "minimal" command has already been performed.]

 5. Read INSTALL.alias. Minimal survival command:
       # (cd ~alias; touch .qmail-postmaster .qmail-mailer-daemon .qmail-root)
       # chmod 644 ~alias/.qmail*

[The "minimal" command has already been performed.]

 6. Read INSTALL.mbox and INSTALL.vsm.

 7. Read INSTALL.maildir.

 8. Copy /var/qmail/boot/home (or proc) to /var/qmail/rc.

[When you do this, qmail will be started automatically the next time
 you boot.  This is because the command
 ``ln -s /var/qmail/rc /usr/local/etc/rc.d'' has been executed.  There
 is a number of sample bootfiles provided.  Not all of them will work.]

To test qmail deliveries (won't interfere with sendmail):

 9. Enable deliveries of messages injected into qmail:
       # csh -cf '/var/qmail/rc &'

10. Read TEST.deliver.


To upgrade from sendmail to qmail:

11. Read SENDMAIL. This is what your users will want to know about the
    switch from sendmail to qmail.

12. Read REMOVE.sendmail. You must remove sendmail before installing
    qmail.

[Do not disable sendmail as instructed in REMOVE.sendmail step #1.
 Instead, change the sendmail_enable line in /etc/rc.conf to read

        sendmail_enable="NO"

 If you are running a FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE or later, read
 PORT_NOTES_FreeBSD_40-RELEASE before executing step 12.
 ]

13. Read REMOVE.binmail.

14. Add
            csh -cf '/var/qmail/rc &'
    to your boot scripts, so that the qmail daemons are restarted
    whenever your system reboots. Make sure you include the &.

[Do not do this.  Unless you remove the symlink
 /usr/local/etc/rc.d/qmail.sh, the script /var/qmail/rc will be run
 everytime you boot.  See also "local_startup" in /etc/rc.conf.]

15. Make qmail's ``sendmail'' wrapper available to MUAs:
       # ln -s /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail
       # ln -s /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail
    /usr/sbin might not exist on your system.

16. Set up qmail-smtpd in /etc/inetd.conf (all on one line):
            smtp stream tcp nowait qmaild /var/qmail/bin/tcp-env
            tcp-env /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd

[A freshly-updated /etc/inetd.conf will have a sample qmail entry that
 you can simply uncomment.]

17. Reboot. (Or kill -HUP your inetd and make sure the qmail daemons
    are running.)

18. Read TEST.receive.



That's it! To report success:
       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat /var/qmail/doc/SYSDEPS ) \
		| mail djb-qst@cr.yp.to
Replace First M. Last with your name.

[Note that "cat `cat SYSDEPS`" has changed to "cat /var/qmail/doc/SYSDEPS"]
