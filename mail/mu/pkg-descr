mu is a set of command-line tools for dealing with e-mail messages stored in the
Maildir-format. muâ€™s goal is to help you to quickly find the messages you need, view them,
extract attachments, create new maildirs, and so on.

Built on top of mu are some extensions (included in this package):

- mu4e: a full-featured e-mail client that runs inside emacs
- mu-scm: bindings for the Guile/Scheme programming language (version 3.0 and later)
