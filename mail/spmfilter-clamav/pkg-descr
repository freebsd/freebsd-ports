spmfilter-clamav is a plugin for spmfilter that enables spmfilter
to check mails with the Clam AntiVirus open source toolkit for
viruses. The major goal of this plugin is to provide an easy way
for virus-scanning emails. If ClamAV detects malicious software
like viruses the affected email is discarded by the plugin.
Optionally notifications can be enabled to inform the recipients
and sender (configurable) about the discarded message.
