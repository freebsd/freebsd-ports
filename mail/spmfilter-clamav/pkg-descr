spmfilter-clamav is a plugin for spmfilter that enables spmfilter 
to check mails with the Clam AntiVirus open source toolkit for 
viruses. The major goal of this plugin is to provide an easy way 
for virus-scanning emails. If ClamAV detects malicious software 
like viruses the affected email is discarded by the plugin. 
Optionally notifications can be enabled to inform the recipients
and sender (configurable) about the discarded message.
