rblsmtpd is a generic tool to block mail from RBL-listed sites. It works
with any SMTP server that can run under tcpserver; in particular, any
version of qmail or sendmail. Turning it on is easy: simply insert
rblsmtpd in front of the real SMTP server in your inetd.conf (or
tcpserver) invocation.

rblsmtpd supports anti-RBL lists for sites that want to skip RBL lookups
for preauthorized hosts. It also optionally pays attention to temporary
RBL lookup errors.
