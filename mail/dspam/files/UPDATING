This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading dspam port.  I will try my best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time before attempting any port upgrade.

This file concetrate on the FreeBSD / port specific changes and one should read
also the UPGRADING enclosed in the dspam distribution. You can see it by doing
in the port directory:
make extract;  more `find . -type f -maxdepth 2 -name UPGRADING`

# dspam-3.4.5
#

A lot of things have changed and your existing dspam.conf won't probably
work anymore. Please compare it with the dspam.conf.sample located in the
same etc/ directory.

Most notable addition is the SMTP delivery which together with "standard"
inbound LMTP make a very nice content and light (e.g. it's the fastest setup
I've had so far) filter.

Database structure is roughly the same but you may wish to check your
existing database structure with the *.sql corresponding to you database
driver from EXAMPLESDIR (Mysql 4.1.x is now default as it's _much_ faster).
Please read carefully distributed docs like README and UPGRADING.

# dspam-3.2.8
#

- BUGFIX: fixed TOE autowhitelist


#############################################################################
# dspam-3.2.7
#

- BUGFIX: Signature not written to some email, making them untrainable


#############################################################################
# dspam-3.2.6.20050128.1500
#

- disable ORACLE DB back-end; it's unmaintained and hasn't work on FreeBSD
- (added post-factum) Fix mysql/neural-combination
- (added post-factum) change POSTGRESQL* to POSTGRESQL because of "Split the

#############################################################################
# dspam-3.2.6
#

- In v3.2.6, the default level of statistical sedation has been changed from
5 to 0 (off). This feature is normally overridden by dspam.conf, but if you
have removed the feature from the default configuration, this may change
DSPAM's behavior. To ensure that nothing changes in your filter's behavior,
make sure the following line is in your dspam.conf:
Feature tb=5

- fix for statisticalSedation ignore


#############################################################################
# dspam-3.2.4
#

- drop WITH_WHITELIST, is not supported by ./configure but by dspam.conf

[20041203.0800] jonz: performance fixes for pgsql_drv
minor performance fixed for pgsql_drv that may have a big effect on some
implementations. you should also consider creating the (unnecessary) index
below to precent the pgsql query builder from getting confused:
CREATE INDEX id_token_data_04 ON dspam_token_data(uid);


#############################################################################
# dspam-3.2.3.20041229.1945
#

- drop QUARANTINE_AGENT as is not supported by ./configure anymore and
set in dspam.conf UntrustedDeliveryAgent and QuarantineAgent to default to
TrustedDeliveryAgent, but leave them commented out
(ports/75548 by Julien Gabel)
- change default DSPAM_HOME_MODE to 0770
(ports/75549 by Julien Gabel <jpeg@thilelli.net>)
- DSPAM_HOME_{OWNER,GROUP} default to DSPAM_{OWNER,GROUP}


#############################################################################
# dspam-3.2.3.20041218.2100_1
#

- fix installation of SQLite docs and implicitly package 
(reported by: pointyhat via kris@)

#############################################################################
# dspam-3.2.3.20041218.2100 (this is really 3.2.3 release)
#

- change of name: SQLITE --> SQLITE2, as the -devel port already have sqlite3
support
- fix deinstall to delete dspam.conf if it hasn't been cutomized, as 
requested by kris@ with "Ports Janitor" hat :)
- correct long-standing copy/paste bug DSPAM_{GROUPD,MODE} where set to
DSPAM_HOME_{GROUP,MODE} 

#############################################################################
# dspam-3.2.3.20041203.1245_1 (entry added post-factum, it was an automated 
#                            update approved by me but not under my control )
#

- chase dependecy for sqlite

#############################################################################
# dspam-3.2.3.20041203.1245
#

- now we support also MYSQL50 and we handle MYSQL cases right based on a 
patch sent by Gea-Suan Lin <gslin@netnews.NCTU.edu.tw>
- add support for exim as suggested by 
Shahbaz Javeed <sjaveed@adderpit.com>; we try to build exim with the same
database back-end if possible (still work to do to automate pg 7.3 case)
- fix PREF_EXT and BDB4 cases as well in our Makefile (actually is 4.1 and 
I'm thinking about dropping support for it since SQLite works a lot better if
you don't want a full sql server; feedback welcome)
- also small vendor bug-fixes (pgp signed mails, pgsql driver)

#############################################################################
#  dspam-3.2.3
#

- important fixes from 3.2.2:
 BUGFIX: DSPAM misreads boundary delimiter in signed Apple Mail messages
 BUGFIX: Signature is not written to multipart blocks with no content type
 BUGFIX: dspam_dump for a particular token fails with MySQL 4.1
 BUGFIX: Bayesian Noise Reduction is never instantiated

To upgrade you should:

0. Read docs enclosed with teh dpsam distribution, beginnig with UPGRADING and
README

1. Adjust your OPTIONs
( make rmconfig config in dspam port dir, command line, pkg_tools.conf )

2. make VARs.......
in dspam port dir with appropiate OPTIONS and VARs (see changes above)

3. stop you MTA or deactivate dspam from it

5. make VARs........ install

4.a) If using MySQL 4.0.xx or PostgreSQL:
- back-up the database
- use the appropiate migration scripts from files dir of dspam port dir
( for MySQL you should use 2x_to_3x_db.sql then 310_to_320.my.sql)
(if using MySQL 4.1.x or 3.xx you're on your own for now; the same for 
PostgreSQL, but take a look in the UPDATING and 310_to_320.pg.sql)

5. Back-up and them move the files from the old DSPAM_HOME 
(defaulted: /usr/loca/etc/dspam) to the new DSPAM_HOME (default /var/db/dspam) 
or where ever you defined DSPAM_HOME in 2 above.

6. Adjust you new dspam.conf according with your setup OPTIONS and VARs defined
on make / mak install step.

7. Remove the old setup files (you have them in the back-up, right ?)

8. Enable dspam in the MTA setup, but only locally or something and start testing.

If something ain't working is one of:
- permissions problems (hint: with what UID 
is dspam called from your MTA vs. DSPAM_HOME and DSPAM_LOG_DIR)
- something wrong in dspam.conf (hint: you didn't remove old config files 
and they are still used ?)
