   "My Mailer" is an incarnation of a UNIX text-based mailer
designed to be an intermediate step between mail and pine.

   Features:

   MIME aware -- While this mailer does not implement a full set of
the MIME mail extensions, it should handle most MIME mail.
It also handles some Sun mail attachment formats.

   Threaded messages -- Articles by default are threaded by subject.
This allows one to plow through huge mailing list discussions,
sometimes spanning weeks, with very little effort.

   Automatic detection of a modified mail file, and the changes will
then be merged with the current message listing.
	    
   Automatically uncompresses and recompresses gzipped mailfiles

   Searchable message listings, including search through message text
