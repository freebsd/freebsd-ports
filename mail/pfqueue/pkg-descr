A console-based tool for handling postfix queues

pfqueue is an effort to give postqueue/mailq/postsuper a console
(ncurses) interface: it won't add any particular functionality 
to those provided with postfix itself, but will hopefully make 
them to use.

It's a real-time queue scanner, that show per-queue lists of 
existing messages; the messages can be deleted, put on hold or 
released

Just for example, it may be useful to inspect a traffic jam at a
given time, to see what is falling into and unexpectedly crowding
you deferred queue
