Simple, fast, sh-based filters to integrate Pine with gnupg, or pgp6.

In addition to the standard functions of encrypt/decrypt and sign/verify, I've
added pseudo-filters to verify or decrypt messages that were sent using MIME
encoding to. See INSTALL for how to use it. It's not possible for a sending
filter to create these kinds of MIME messages, since Pine does not give the
user the ability to twiddle attachments.
