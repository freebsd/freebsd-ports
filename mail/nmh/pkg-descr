what is it?
-----------
nmh (new MH) is an electronic mail handling system.  It was
originally based on the package MH-6.8.3, and is intended to be
a (mostly) compatible drop-in replacement for MH.

nmh is currently in BETA testing/development.  It seems to be
generally stable, but things may break from release to release
as changes are made.
