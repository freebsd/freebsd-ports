The qtools package comprises several utilities for use with qmail,
typically as part of .qmail command processing.

Included are tools to extract the message body, extract all or
parts of the header, check an address list for a matching address
or domain, message filtering and forwarding, write to a maildir,
and automatically reply to certain messages.
