FIRST INSTALLATION

If this is a first installation of automatic addressbook plugin, you
have to execute the relevant initialisation SQL script for your
chosen database backend :

%%PLUGINDIR%%/SQL/<dbtype>.initial.sql

If your Roundcube Database starts with a prefix set the prefix also in the SQL Statement: "REFERENCES `PREFIX_users`(`user_id`)"

You will also need to copy :
%%PLUGINDIR%%/config/config.inc.php.dist to
%%PLUGINDIR%%/config/config.inc.php
and edit as you need.

Finally, you will need to add the plugin to your list of loadable
plugins in %%RCDIR%%/config/main.inc.php or %%RCDIR%%/config/config.inc.php depending on your roundcube version, for example:

    $rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('automatic_addressbook',);

UPGRADING

If you already had a previous version of automatic addressbook plugin
installed, you should update your database schema by executing the
relevant upgrade SQL script for your chosen database backend :

%%PLUGINDIR%%/SQL/<dbtype>.update.sql scripts.
