This is sSMTP, a program that replaces sendmail on workstations that
should send their mail via the departmental mailhub from which they pick up
their mail (via pop, imap, rsmtp, pop_fetch, NFS... or the like).  This
program accepts mail and sends it to the mailhub, optionally replacing the
domain in the From: line with a different one.
