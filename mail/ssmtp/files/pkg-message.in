To replace sendmail with ssmtp type "make replace" or change
your /etc/mail/mailer.conf to:

sendmail	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/ssmtp
send-mail	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/ssmtp
mailq		%%PREFIX%%/sbin/ssmtp
newaliases	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/ssmtp
hoststat	/usr/bin/true
purgestat	/usr/bin/true


However, before you can use the program, you should copy the files
"revaliases.sample" and "ssmtp.conf.sample" in %%PREFIX%%/etc/ssmtp
to "revaliases" and "ssmtp.conf" respectively and edit them to suit
your needs.
