Elmo (ELectronic Mail Operator) is an ncurses-based program for
receiving, filtering, reading, composing, and sending mail from a
character terminal.  It speaks POP3 and SMTP and can work with
maildir or Berkeley-formatted mailboxes.

This version is a development version, but is rather stable, and
is known to work better than the stable version on FreeBSD 4.x.

Before running elmo, users should run elmoconf.pl to generate an
~/.elmorc file.
