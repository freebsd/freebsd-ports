This software provides an easy and functional way to audit incoming and
outgoing e-mails from a qmail server. It works by means of qmail-queue
wrapping. It has a control file which allows selective auditing of sender or
recipient, as well as whom the messages should be forwarded to. This control
file allows regular expressions, what increases its flexibility of use.
