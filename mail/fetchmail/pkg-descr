Fetchmail is a full-featured IMAP/POP2/POP3/APOP/KPOP/ETRN/ODMR client with
easy configuration, daemon mode, forwarding via SMTP or local MDA, and
superior reply handling.  It is used to handle intermittent email connections
by acting as a coupling that seamlessly batch forwards fetched mail from your
mail server to your local delivery system, allowing you to read your it
with your favourite mail user agent.  Fetchmail also includes useful spam
filtering and multi-user functions.

A typical use of fetchmail is to connect to your ISP's POP3 server,
downloading your mail into the INBOX on your local computer.  You may then
read the mail, offline if you want, using pine, mutt, or any standard mail
user agent.
