 See the file %%DOCSDIR%%/README for advice about 
 how to configure DSPAM with your MTA and setting up the CGI with Apache.
 Examples are provided for sendmail, postfix, exim and courier MTAs.

%%POSTFIX_MBC%%
%%POSTFIX_MBC%% Quick Postfix setup guide:
%%POSTFIX_MBC%% Add root, postfix and cgiuser to %%PREFIX%%/etc/dspam/trusted.users
%%POSTFIX_MBC%% (Do NOT add --user $USER to the call of dspam binary)
%%POSTFIX_MBC%% In main.cf set 
%%POSTFIX_MBC%%  mailbox_command = %%PREFIX%%/bin/dspam --mode=teft --deliver=innocent,spam --feature=chained,noise -d %u
%%POSTFIX_MBC%% And don't forget to set
%%POSTFIX_MBC%% %%PREFIX%%/etc/dspam/untrusted.mailer_args
%%POSTFIX_MBC%% (for mail.local it could be /usr/libexec/mail.local -s %u)
%%POSTFIX_MBC%%
 Note that man entries have been added for all dspam binaries.

%%MYSQL%% for instructions on how to configure MySQL
%%MYSQL%% for use with DSPAM.
%%MYSQL%%
%%MYSQL%% %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/mysql/mysql.data
%%MYSQL%% contains an example configuration for use with MySQL.
%%MYSQL%% Edit and install as
%%MYSQL%% %%PREFIX%%/etc/dspam/mysql.data
%%MYSQL%% To modify an 2.x database use and use it with dspam 3.x use:
%%MYSQL%% %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/mysql/2x_to_3x_db.sql

%%PGSQL%% %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/pgsql.data
%%PGSQL%% contains an example configuration for use with PostgreSQL.
%%PGSQL%% Edit and install as
%%PGSQL%% %%PREFIX%%/etc/dspam/pgsql.data

%%SQLITE%%
%%SQLITE%% See %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/sqlite/README
%%SQLITE%% for suggestion on SQLite back-end. It should work out-of-the-box.
%%SQLITE%%
%%SQLITE%% You'll always want to run dspam_clean -p0 and 
%%SQLITE%% sqlite /path/to/user.sdb < vacuum after a corpusfeed.
%%SQLITE%% where /path/to/user.sdb would by on a default install: 
%%SQLITE%% %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/dspam/data/user/user.sdb
%%SQLITE%% There are  most likely 70%+ junk tokens that need to be removed.
%%SQLITE%% This will have a HUGE impact on the disk space your db uses.
%%SQLITE%%

%%CGI%% The GCI files had been installed in
%%CGI%% %%CGI_PATH%%
