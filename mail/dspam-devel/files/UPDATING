$FreeBSD$

This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading dspam port.  I will try my best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time before attempting any port upgrade.

This file concetrate on the FreeBSD / port specific changes and one should read
also the UPGRADING enclosed in the dspam distribution. You can see it by doing
in the port directory:
make extract;  more `find . -type f -maxdepth 2 -name UPGRADING`

# dspam-devel-3.5.0.20050428.1100
#

This is the post-3.4 devel branch. A lot of things have changed and your
existing dspam.conf won't probably work anymore. Please compare it with the
dspam.conf.sample located in the same etc/ directory.

Most notable addition is the SMTP delivery which together with "standard"
inbound LMTP make a very nice content and light (e.g. it's the fastest setup
I've had so far) filter.

Database structure is roughly the same but you may wish to check your
existing database structure with the *.sql corresponding to you database
driver from EXAMPLESDIR (Mysql 4.1.x is now default as it's _much_ faster).
Please read carefully distributed docs like README, UPGRADING and CHANGES.

# dspam-devel-3.4.r2.20050305.0930 (this is post RC2A)
#

- BUGFIX: fix dspamc hanging when using --stdout
- BUGFIX: fixed TOE auto whitelisting
- BUGFIX: individual logging
- BUGFIX: parsetoheaders and daemon mode combo
- BUGFIX: autodetect bugs in cgi
- BUGFIXES for stats
- BUGFIXES for some un-standard mails segfaults

- NEW FEATURES: LMTP delivery, "standard" LMTP inbound support;
see CHANGELOG, README and dspam.conf for details (tested slightly on BSD)

- note (very late) SBL query support and SBL queue logging support
(both SBL client and server ports are WIP)

- As of 3.4 Beta 2, the PostgreSQL driver uses BIGINT instead of NUMERIC(20)
type to store tokens in database (fully backward compatible). This change
speedup driver and reduce storage space used by dspam. Use:
dspam_pg2int8 /tmp/dspam_pg_mig.sql
and follow the instructions.

# dspam-devel-3.4.r1.20050216.0945
#

- if dspam --daemon SIGBUS please send your sources date, CFLAGS and other
relevant information; this version is believed to be working; tested on:
i386 5.2.1-RELEASE-p1, i386 5.3-STABLE, amd64 5.3-RELEASE with help from Erwin Lansing <erwin@lansing.dk>,
"Daniel S. Haischt" <me@daniel.stefan.haischt.name> and Joey Freeland <joeyfreeland@gmail.com>
- patch dspam.c for bug causing signature to not get written to message
body (obtained from dspam cvs)
- patch dspam.c to write X-DSPAM-User also in innocent messages headers
- drop WITH_WHITELIST, it's not supported by ./configure but by dspam.conf
- (added post-factum) change POSTGRESQL* to POSTGRESQL because of "Split the
postgresql ports into a server and a client part"

# dspam-devel-3.3.4
#

The daemon mode seems to be completead now, so the port act like it should:
- if enabled with WITH_DEAMON we install the rc script; to start it at
boot put 'dspam_enable="YES"' in /etc/rc.conf and set the appropriate
options in dspam.conf
- read section "2.3 Client/Server Mode" from dspam README to learn how to
use dspam in daemon mode
- a simple portupgrade from previous versions will work with no problems
with your current setup, even if compiled with WITH_DEAMON (default)

- change default DB back-end to MySQL to make daemon mode work for package
building
- add MySQL v5.0.x support -- MYSQL50
(based on ports/74761 by Gea-Suan Lin <gslin@netnews.NCTU.edu.tw>)
- USE_MYSQL and have make describe output right

- change of name: SQLITE --> SQLITE2, as we now have sqlite3 support
- add Sqlite v3.x support -- SQLITE3
- add BNR_DEBUG option
- drop QUARANTINE_AGENT as is not supported by ./configure anymore and
set in dspam.conf UntrustedDeliveryAgent and QuarantineAgent to default to
TrustedDeliveryAgent, but leave them commented out
(ports/75548 by Julien Gabel)
- change default DSPAM_HOME_MODE to 0770
(ports/75549 by Julien Gabel <jpeg@thilelli.net>)
- DSPAM_HOME_{OWNER,GROUP} default to DSPAM_{OWNER,GROUP}
- default maximum message size to 300KB in dspam.conf
- correct long-standing copy/paste bug (DSPAM_{GROUP,MODE} were set to
DSPAM_HOME_{GROUP,MODE})
- USE_MYSQL and have make describe output right
- add support for exim [2] which we build with the same database back-end
as dspam if possible ( suggested, incorrectly, in ports/74762 by
Shahbaz Javeed <sjaveed@adderpit.com> )
- fix PREF_EXT and BDB4 cases as well in our Makefile


#############################################################################
# dspam-devel=3.3.0.a.20041203.1245_1 (entry added post-factum, it was an
#                   automated update approved by me but not under my control)
#

- chase dependecy for sqlite


############################################################################
# dspam-devel-3.3.0.a.20041201.1330
#

Say hello to the daemonized dspam! Enble it at compile-time with DAEMON option.

- it speaks LMTP:
LHLO
MAIL FROM: [password]@[server id]
RCPT TO: [list of DSPAM users] [DSPAM parameters] [delivery agent parameters]
DATA
[message]
.

- daemon processes *and* delivers at the moment (including to stdout).
- For client-side delivery, use --stdout and configure your MTA to deliver.
- it may be necessary to perform all delivery in the client, as using fork &&
  pipe in a MT app may be bad
- implemented multiple responses per recipient
- changed storage driver layer to use a driver context (for caching connections)
- stateful db connections done for mysql driver
- to do next: client

- remember that all this is experimental and it may change at any time.


############################################################################
# dspam-devel-3.3.0.a.20041125.0945
#

- changed the naming scheme because of to many upstream modification in
tarball naming - right now it lacks any version (for the same reason the
distfile is renamed from snapshot.tar.gz to PKGNAME and sits on my server);
\ it is now made up of:
PORTNAME:		dspam-devel
next MINOR_VERSION:	3.3.0
we're in pre-beta:	a
SNAPSHOT_DATE:		20041125.0945
\ the strange ``a'' is necessary for pkg_version to work correctly when we will
have the 3.3.0 beta's, rc's and release (tested with pkg_version -t)

- follow the update procedure from the entry bellow

- there is a new and very useful dspam.conf option:
 MaxMessageSize - specify a maximum message size to process
\ I suggest setting it somewhere between 100 and 300 KB, it is unlikely the
spam you are receiving is bigger and this will improve performance as big
messages won't stuck the database

- tum mode has been enhanced and it should outperform teft

To upgrade you should:

0. Read docs enclosed with teh dpsam distribution, beginnig with UPGRADING and
README

1. Adjust your OPTIONs
( make rmconfig config in dspam port dir, command line, pkg_tools.conf )

2. make VARs.......
in dspam port dir with appropiate OPTIONS adn VARs (see changes above)

3. stop you MTA or deactivate dspam from it

5. make VARs........ install

4.a) If using MySQL 4.0.xx or PostgreSQL:
- back-up the database
- use the appropiate migration script from files dir of dspam port dir
(if using MySQL 4.1.x or 3.xx you're on your own for now)

5. Back-up and them move the files from the old DSPAM_HOME
(defaulted: /usr/loca/etc/dspam) to the new DSPAM_HOME (default /vad/db/dspam)
or where ever you defined DSPA_HOME in 2 above.

6. Adjust you new dspam.conf according with your setup OPTIONS and VARs defined
on make / mak install step.

7. Remove the old setup files (you have them in the back-up, right ?)

7. Enable dspam in the MTA setup, but only locally or something and start testing.

If something ain't working is one of:
- permissions problems (hint: with what UID
is dspam called from your MTA vs. DSPAM_HOME and DSPAM_LOG_DIR)
- something wrong in dspam.conf (hint: you didn't remove old config files
and they are still used ?)
