Fancy biff program under X11 environment.

Hbiff is a replacement for xbiff that flashes when new mail arrives like the
traditional xbiff.  In addition, if you click on the hbiff icon, a window
will popup showing the mail headers.  This makes hbiff better than xlbiff
where privacy is an issue since the headers are only displayed when you
request.  hbiff can also run the MUA for you.
