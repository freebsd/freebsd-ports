If you are upgrading, you may need to update your existing database.
You can do so by browsing to [URL]/setup.php where [URL] is the
postfixadmin root.

To avoid checksum errors when uninstalling or upgrading postfixadmin,
do not edit config.inc.php.  Instead, put your configuration settings
in config.local.php in the postfixadmin webroot.  That file will be
included automatically by config.inc.php.

For detailed information, please see the complete installation steps
in %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.TXT.

For upgrade-related details, including configuration changes, see
%%DOCSDIR%%/CHANGELOG.TXT.
