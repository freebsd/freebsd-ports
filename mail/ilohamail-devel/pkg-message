IlohaMail has now been installed.

Create a redirect one of the following methods:
 - add an alias to apache's httpd.conf pointing to %%ILOHADIR%%/source
 - create a VirtualHost with DocumentRoot set to %%ILOHADIR%%/source
 - make a symbolic link to %%ILOHADIR%%/source

Check your PHP.ini file.  You need:
 - short_open_tag = On
 - file_uploads = On

Edit %%ILOHADIR%%/conf/conf.inc and
%%ILOHADIR%%/conf/login.inc files as necessary.

Using the MySQL back-end is also recommended.

  1. Create database user who has rights on webmail database manipulation
     by following "sample" mysql commands:

     $ mysql -u root -p
     mysql> use mysql;
     mysql> grant select,insert,update,delete,index,
         -> alter,create,drop,references, lock tables,
         -> create temporary tables on webmail.* to webmail@localhost
         -> identified by 'password';
     mysql> flush privileges;

  2. Create a MySQL database.
     $ mysqladmin create webmail

  3. Create tables.
     $ mysql webmail < %%DATADIR%%/MySQL/sql

  4. Configure %%ILOHADIR%%/conf/db_conf.php.

  5. Set value of $backend in %%ILOHADIR%%/conf/conf.inc from "FS" to "DB".

For more complete database setup, post-installation instructions
please read IlohaMail Guide in %%DOCSDIR%%/Manual.
