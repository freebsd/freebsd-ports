Post-Install Notes for Majordomo v1.93
======================================

Before you can use Majordomo, you will need to complete a few steps
manually:

	- customize 'majordomo.cf' in your majordomo directory

	- look at 'aliases.majordomo' in your majordomo directory for examples
	  of how to create lists.  A test list (test-l) has been created and
	  configured for you.  Be sure to remove this list if you do not
	  want to use it for testing.

	- substitute your own email address for "Postmaster" for the
	  "majordomo-owner" alias.

	- add 'aliases.majordomo' to your sendmail configuration.  This can
	  be done by adding a line similar to the following to 
	  /etc/sendmail.cf :

	  OA/etc/aliases.majordomo (for 8.6.x Sendmail)
	  
	  O AliasFile=/etc/aliases,/etc/aliases.majordomo (for 8.7.x Sendmail)

	  or a line similar to the following to your m4 macros file :

	  define(`ALIAS_FILE',/etc/aliases,/etc/aliases.majordomo')


Enjoy Majordomo!
