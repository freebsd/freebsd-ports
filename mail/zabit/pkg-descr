Almost anyone would agree that the most prominent problem
facing mail server administrators is spam mails.
For that we've decided to code a program which
will be able to detect and reject spam before the mail gets queued.

Zabit is a content/attachment filter for qmail.
It's been coded in C language for performance reasons.

Zabit does content filtering and attachment control.
