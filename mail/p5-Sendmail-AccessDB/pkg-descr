This module is designed so that users of the Sendmail::Milter module (or other
Sendmail programmers) can ascertain if a user has elected to whitelist
themselves as a "spam friend" (where there should be no spam filtering on mail
to them) or, where spam-filtering is not the default, but an option, where
certain receipients have been labeled as "spam haters".
