qmHandle is a simple program which allows you to view and manage a qmail
message queue.

The key features of qmHandle are:
  * You can read the qmail queue, like you do with the qmail-qread program.
    However, the output of this program is improved over qmail-qread, with
    the output of the message subjects and color capabilities;
  * You can print queue statistics, like qmail-qstat, with color capabilities;
  * You can view a message in the queue;
  * You can remove a message from the queue.
