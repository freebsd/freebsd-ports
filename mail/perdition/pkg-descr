Perdition is a mail retrieval proxy that allows users to connect to a
content-free POP3 or IMAP4 server that will redirect them to their real
POP3 or IMAP4 server. This enables mail retrieval for a domain to be
split across multiple backend servers on a per user basis. It can also
be used as a POP3 or IMAP4 proxy in firewall applications.

Perdition supports arbitrary library based map access to determine the
server for each user - POSIX regex, GDBM, PostgreSQL, MySQL, NIS and
OpenLDAP libraries ship with the distribution.

Please note that this package does not include support for PostgreSQL,
MySQL or OpenLDAP, however if you build the port and you have any of
those installed, the apropriate libraries WILL be build and you will
be able to use them. Please note though that the packing list does not
take these into account!

The use of perditon to scale mail services beyond a single box is discussed
in a paper the author wrote on high capacity email, so be sure to check the
web page.
