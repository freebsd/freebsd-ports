This plugin implements logging functionality for your webmail interface.
You can choose to log to a database, a file, your system log, or any
combination thereof. You can also choose which kinds of events to log,
including login events, logout events, login error events, all outgoing
messages, possible outgoing spam messages, and other error events.

Also included is monitoring functionality that will send alert emails to
the administrator when certain events trigger.

If you use the timeout_user plugin, logout events caused by user timeouts
will be captured.

Log message format is also completely custom-defined to meet your needs
in the configuration file.
