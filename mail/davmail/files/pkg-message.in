In order to connect to several exchange servers, it is needed setup davmail
profiles. You have to set davmail_profiles in rc.conf, and configure
%%LOCALBASE%%/etc/davmail.<profile_name>.properties properly. Example:

davmail_profiles="exchange1 exchange2"
(and configure both %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/davmail.exchange[12].properties)

You can also disable an specific profile by mean of
davmail_<profile_name>_enable="NO" in rc.conf.
