readpst: A tool for converting Outlook .pst files to Unix mbox and other
formats.

This version can now convert both 32-bit Outlook files (pre-2003), and the
64-bit Outlook 2003 .pst files. Utilities are supplied to convert email messages
to both mbox and MH mailbox formats, and to DII load file format for use with
many of the CT Summation products. Contacts can be converted to a simple list,
to vcard format, or to .ldif format for import to an LDAP server.
