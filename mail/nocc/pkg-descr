Nocc is a Web-based e-mail reader. It uses PHP and a Web server to access
a mail server (POP3, IMAP) and send e-mail (SMTP or plain sendmail).
Nocc can be used as an e-mail reader and allows you to view, send
messages, manage your mail account. It can view and send MIME attachments
(files, HTML, etc.).
Nocc has low requirements on browser, it uses JavaScript as less as
possible, nearly no frames and even works with Lynx without cookies.
