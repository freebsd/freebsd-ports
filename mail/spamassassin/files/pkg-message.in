==========================================================================

You should complete the following post-installation tasks:

	1) Read %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL
	   and %%DOCSDIR%%/UPGRADE
	   BEFORE enabling SpamAssassin for important changes

	2) Edit the configuration in %%ETCDIR%%,
	   in particular %%ETCDIR%%/init.pre
	   You may get lots of annoying (but harmless) error messages
	   if you skip this step.

	3) To run spamd, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:
	   spamd_enable="YES"

	4) Install mail/spamass-rules if you want some third-party
	   spam-catching rulesets

SECURITY NOTE:
By default, spamd runs as root (the AS_ROOT option). If you wish
to change this, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

	spamd_flags="-u spamd -H /var/spool/spamd"
