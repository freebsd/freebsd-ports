sortmail - sort email messages by date/time

sortmail  is  a  front end for decomposemail(1) and recom-
posemail(1).  Each mailbox argument is  disassembled  into
its  component  messages, then these messages are reassem-
bled into new mailboxes based on  command  line  selection
criteria.  Some additional functionality is provided, such
as backup copies, recursion, etc.
