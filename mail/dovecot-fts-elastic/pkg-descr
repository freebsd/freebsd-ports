This projects provides a Dovecot full-text search indexing plugin that uses
ElasticSearch 6 or 7 as a backend.

Dovecot communicates with ElasticSearch using direct HTTP/JSON queries, and
does not require ElasticSearch client libraries. It supports automatic indexing
and searching of e-mail. For mailboxes with more than 10000 messages, it uses
the Elastic Scroll API.
