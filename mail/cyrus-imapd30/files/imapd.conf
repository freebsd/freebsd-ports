# character '.'.
#unixhierarchysep: yes

# Use the alternate IMAP namespace, where personal folders reside at
# the same level in the hierarchy as INBOX.
#
#altnamespace: yes

# If using the alternate IMAP namespace, the prefix for the other
# users namespace.  The hierarchy delimiter will be automatically
# appended.
#
#userprefix: Other Users

# If using the alternate IMAP namespace, the prefix for the shared
# namespace.  The hierarchy delimiter will be automatically appended.
#
#sharedprefix: Shared Folders

# The umask value used by various Cyrus IMAP programs
#
#umask: 077

# Whether to allow anonymous logins
#
#allowanonymouslogin: no

# Allow the use of cleartext passwords on the wire.

# The  minimum  value  is  30,  the default.
#
#timeout: 30

# The interval (in seconds) for polling the mailbox for changes while
# running the IDLE command.  This option is used when idled can not be
# contacted or when polling is used exclusively.  The minimum value is
# 1.  A value of 0 will disable polling (and disable IDLE if polling
# is the only method available).
#
#imapidlepoll: 60

# If enabled, the server responds to an ID command with a parameter
# list containing: version, vendor, support-url, os, os-version,

#popminpoll: 0

# The number of days advertised as being the minimum a message may be
# left on the POP server before it is deleted (via the CAPA command,
# defined in the POP3 Extension Mechanism, which some clients may
# support).  "NEVER", the default, may be specified with a negative
# number.  The Cyrus POP3 server never deletes mail, no matter what
# the value of this parameter is.  However, if a site implements a
# less liberal policy, it needs to change this parameter accordingly.
#
#popexpiretime: 0

# The list of userids with administrative rights.  Separate each userid
# with a space.  We recommend that administrator userids be separate from 
# standard userids.  Sites using Kerberos authentication may use separate

#
#autocreate_quota: -1

# Include notations in the protocol telemetry logs indicating the number
# of seconds since the last command or response.

# This option is passed to the SASL library and overrides its default
# setting.
#

# authentications.   Seperate each realm name by a space.  This option is
# only used when the server is compiled with Kerberos authentication.

# If enabled, any authentication identity which has a rights on a user's
# INBOX may log in as that user.  This option is only used when the server
# is compiled with Kerberos authentication.

# the mailbox and message-id/resent-message-id of all successful
# deliveries.
#
#duplicatesuppression: yes

# If enabled, lmtpd rejects messages with 8-bit characters in the
# headers.  Otherwise, 8-bit characters are changed to `X'.  (A proper
# soultion to non-ASCII characters in headers is offered by RFC 2047
# and its predecessors.)
#
#reject8bit: no

# Maximum incoming LMTP message size.  If set, lmtpd will reject
# messages larger than maxmessagesize bytes.  The default is to allow
# messages of any size.
#
#maxmessagesize: <unlimited>

# Userid used to deliver messages to shared folders.  For example, if
# set to "bb", email sent to "bb+shared.blah" would be delivered to

# "+shared.blah" would be used.
#postuser: <none>

# If enabled at compile time, this specifies a URL to reply when
# Netscape asks the server where the mail administration HTTP server
# is.  The default is a site at CMU with a hopefully informative

# some information of greater use.
