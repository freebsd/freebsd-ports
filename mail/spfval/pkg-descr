Spfval validates SPF records. It does not check them via the network, this was
intentionally omitted in favour of focusing purely on syntactically validating
SPF records. Simply pass the validator a string and it will see if it validates
as an SPFv1 or SPF-Classic record.

If an error is found, it tries its best to report the error in question and the
specific location in the record where the error occurred.
