This project is based on the need for a private message system for ging /
social_stream. Instead of creating our core message system heavily dependent on
our development, we are trying to implement a generic and potent messaging gem.

After looking for a good gem to use we noticed the lack of messaging gems and
functionality in them. Mailboxer tries to fill this void delivering a powerful
and flexible message system. It supports the use of conversations with two or
more participants, sending notifications to recipients (intended to be used as
system notifications “Your picture has new comments”, “John Doe has updated his
document”, etc.), and emailing the messageable model (if configured to do so).
It has a complete implementation of a Mailbox object for each messageable with
inbox, sentbox and trash.

The gem is constantly growing and improving its functionality. As it is used
with our parallel development ging / social_stream we are finding and fixing
bugs continously. If you want some functionality not supported yet or marked as
TODO, you can create an issue to ask for it. It will be great feedback for us,
and we will know what you may find useful in the gem.
