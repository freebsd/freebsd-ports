To enable authentication_milter to run at boot time, set the following
variable in your /etc/rc.conf file:

    authentication_milter_enable="YES"

Check and/or modify the following configuration files to suit your needs:

    %%ETCDIR%%/authentication_milter.json
    %%ETCDIR%%/mail-dmarc.ini

  NOTE: The default settings almost works for test and/or personal use,
        SPF/DKIM/DMARC(no report mail)/ARC(but not enable ARC-Seals) are OK.

        To enable DMARC report feature, now TODO. Because it's required
        p5-Mail-DMARC port setup.

For sendmail users, please add the following line to your sendmail.mc:

    INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`authentication_milter', \
        `S=local:%%RUNDIR%%/auth_milter.sock, F=T, T=R:2m')

For postfix users, please add the following line to your main.cf:

    smtpd_milters = sock:%%RUNDIR%%/auth_milter.sock

    Note: milter sockets must be accessible from postfix/smtpd;
          using inet sockets might be preferred.
