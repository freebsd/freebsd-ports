rss2email is a python script that lets you subscribe to a list of
RSS or Atom feeds and get new posts sent to you by email. It is
generally run via cron, but can be run manually as well.

This is a python 3 rewrite of the original rss2email project by
Lindsey Smith at AllThingsRSS. It does not run on python 2.
