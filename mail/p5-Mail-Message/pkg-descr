A Mail::Message object is a container for MIME-encoded message information, as
defined by RFC2822. Everything what is not specificaly related to storing the
messages in mailboxes (folders) is implemented in this class. Methods which are
related to folders is implemented in the Mail::Box::Message extension.

The main methods are get(), to get information from a message header field, and
decoded() to get the intended content of a message. But there are many more
which can assist your program.

Complex message handling, like construction of replies and forwards, are
implemented in separate packages which are autoloaded into this class. This
means you can simply use these methods as if they are part of this class. Those
package add functionality to all kinds of message objects.
