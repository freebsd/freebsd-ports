CRM114 is a system to examine incoming e-mail, system log streams,
data files or other data streams, and to sort, filter, or alter the
incoming files or data streams according to the user's wildest
desires. Criteria for categorization of data can be by satisfaction
of regexes, by sparse binary polynomial matching with a Bayesian
Chain Rule evaluator, or by other means. Accuracy of the SBPH/BCR
classifier has been seen in excess of 99 per cent, for 1/4 megabyte
of learning text. In other words, CRM114 learns, and it learns fast.
