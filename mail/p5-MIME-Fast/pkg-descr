MIME::Fast is a perl module for creating, editing and parsing MIME
messages.  This module is based on the very good C library called gmime
(currently in development).  MIME::Fast outght to be faster and should
use less memory and CPU resources than standard MIME (perl module),
because MIME::Fast is the wrapper for C functions (calling C function is
much, much less expensive than calling perl function).
