Bogofilter takes an email message or other text on standard input, parses it
into words, does a statistical check against data bases of "good" and "bad"
words, and returns a status code indicating whether or not the message is spam.
Bogofilter decodes base64 or quoted-printable encoded texts and ignores non-text
attachments and HTML comments.
