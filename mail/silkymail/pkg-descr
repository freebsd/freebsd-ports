SilkyMail is an Internet mail client that runs in your browser. It can be used
by itself, or in conjunction with an IMAP or POP-capable client as part of a
complete set of messaging tools. (It works very nicely in conjunction with
Mulberry.)

It was designed by internet mail client experts to work in high-scalability and
diverse environments. It's not just another webmail hack cut of rough cloth -- 
it's a real mail program, that can be used by novice users and advanced users
alike, but with the independence of browser access. SilkyMail is the smoothest
mail client in a browser around.
