================================================================
QMRTG has been installed.

1) A "qmrtg/" directory has been added to ${PREFIX}/www/data
If you don't care publishing qmrtg's reports, just run a polite
$ rm -rf ${WWWROOTDIR}/qmrtg
Also remind to remove it if you definitively uninstall qmrtg.

2) to enable qmrtg monitoring:
a) have a look at the ${PREFIX}/www/data/cfg/mrtg.cfg" file.
you must at least set the 'WorkDir:' variable and qmail log paths
(search for '/var/log/supervise/qmail' and adapt to your system)
b) configure qmrtg.conf. Defaults are fine generally. At least copy
${PREFIX}/etc/qmrtg.conf.sample to "qmrtg.conf".
c) make mrtg run automatically. Using cron, put that in "/etc/crontab": 

*/5 * * * *   root /usr/local/bin/mrtg \
         /usr/local/www/data/qmrtg/cfg/mrtg.cfg 1>/dev/null 2>&1

Note: to skip qmrtg reporting your mx' whole history at the first call,
run the following before point "c)"
$ qmrtgsync.sh
