This perl module uses objects to make it easy to interface with Gmail.
I eventually hope to implement all of the functionality of the Gmail
website, plus additional features.

Because Gmail is currently in Beta testing, expect this module to
break as they make updates to thier interface. I will attempt to
keep this module in line with the changes they make, but, if after
updating to the newest version of this module, the feature that you
require still doesn't work, please contact me with the issue.
