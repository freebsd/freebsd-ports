This program is a filter which shall improve the readability for messages
(emails and posts) by *hiding* some annoying parts, including:
- mailing list footers
- excessive quoting 
- overlong signatures
- Outlook-style "TOFU" (text above - full quote below)
- squeeze sequences of blank lines or punctuation

Its primary mode of operation is a display filter in MUA (it has special
support for Mutt), but it can also be used in MTA/MDA - e.g. for immediately
bouncing "improper" messages.
