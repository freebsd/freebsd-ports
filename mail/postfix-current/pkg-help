Readme SASL:

Dovecot uses its own daemon process for authentication.  Because there is no
need to link extra libraries into Postfix, Dovecot SASL will be build into
Postfix by default.

Cyrus SASL is optional and will be the default if build with SASL=on

To find out what SASL implementations are compiled into Postfix, use the
following commands:

 % postconf -a (SASL support in the SMTP server)
 % postconf -A (SASL support in the SMTP+LMTP client)
 % postconf smtpd_sasl_type (show default SASL)
