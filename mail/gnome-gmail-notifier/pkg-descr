The Gnome Gmail Notifier project aims to provide a stable, efficient
GTK+2.0 application that provides periodic updates that pertain to the
user's gmail inbox.

The Notifier presents itself as a system tray icon in the GNOME2
desktop, displaying a small balloon popup when the user recieves new
mail.
