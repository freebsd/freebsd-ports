mail-parser is not only a wrapper for email Python Standard Library. It give you
an easy way to pass from raw mail to Python object that you can use in your
code. It's the key module of SpamScope.

mail-parser can parse Outlook email format (.msg) with msgconvert from
mail/p5-Email-Outlook-Message.

mail-parser takes as input a raw email and generates a parsed object. The
properties of this object are the same name of RFC headers: bcc, cc, date,
delivered_to, from_ (not from because is a keyword of Python), message_id,
received, reply_to, subject, to.

There are other properties to get: body, body html, body plain, headers,
attachments, sender IP address, to domains, timezone.
