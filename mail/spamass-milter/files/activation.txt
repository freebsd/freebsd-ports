In order to activate spamass-milter, follow these steps:

1. Review and customize your system-wide SpamAssassin preference, by
   editing /usr/local/etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  Refer to the SpamAssassin
   manpage Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf(3) for details on what to put in it.

2. If you didn't activate spamd (the SpamAssassin daemon), do so now:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/sa-spamd.sh start

3. Activate spamass-milter:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/spamass-milter.sh start

4. Backup your sendmail.cf (in /etc/mail).

5. If you didn't create your own customized version of Sendmail .mc
   file, create one from the default template (hostname.mc):

	cd /etc/mail
	make

6. Add the spamass-milter hook to your hostname.mc file.  The magic
   line to add is:

	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`spamassassin', `S=local:/var/run/spamass-milter.sock, F=, T=C:15m;S:4m;R:4m;E:10m')
	define(`confMILTER_MACROS_CONNECT',`b, j, _, {daemon_name}, {if_name}, {if_addr}')dnl

   Everything should go on a single line, no line break/continuation is
   allowed!  The best place to add this is right after the dnsbl-related
   comments.  (Hint: Every comment in an .mc file starts with `dnl'.)

7. Rebuild the sendmail.cf from your .mc file:

	cd /etc/mail
	make
	make install

8. Restart Sendmail:

	cd /etc/mail
	make stop
	make start

9. Test the whole piece:

	echo "Testing spamass-milter..." | mail -s"Spam test" root

   This might take a long time to finish (up to about 10-20 seconds),
   since spamd has just started, so please be patient.

   You (root) should receive a message from root@hostname, bearing this
   header line:

	X-Spam-Status: No, ...

   If things don't work as expected, promptly restore the stock FreeBSD
   sendmail.cf (/etc/mail/freebsd.cf) as your default sendmail config,
   or restore your own backup (if you keep one), as shown in step 8;
   you may lose incoming mail otherwise!


Now all messages received by Sendmail are filtered through
SpamAssassin, and probable spam messages are tagged with the header
`X-Spam-Flag: YES'.  Tell your users about this so they can set up
appropriate filters in their mail client.
