This is a module for finding a subset of RFC 822 email addresses in
arbitrary text. The addresses it finds are not guaranteed to exist or
even actually be email addresses at all, but they will be valid RFC 822
syntax.

Email::Find will perform some heuristics to avoid some of the more
obvious red herrings and false addresses, but there's only so much which
can be done without a human.
