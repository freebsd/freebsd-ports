The ipop2d, ipop3d, and imapd daemons should be invoked by your
/etc/inetd.conf file with lines such as:

pop2    stream  tcp     nowait  root    %%PREFIX%%/libexec/ipop2d   ipop2d
pop3    stream  tcp     nowait  root    %%PREFIX%%/libexec/ipop3d   ipop3d
imap4   stream  tcp     nowait  root    %%PREFIX%%/libexec/imapd    imapd

If PAM authentication support has been compiled in you will need to add
something like the following lines to /etc/pam.conf (PAM authentication is
default):

imap	auth	required	pam_unix.so
imap	account	required	pam_unix.so
imap	session	required	pam_unix.so
pop3	auth	required	pam_unix.so
pop3	account	required	pam_unix.so
pop3	session	required	pam_unix.so

The pam_unix module does not have session support, so we do not use it for
session management. Be sure to read up on pam.conf(5).

To configure imap-uw read %%DOCSDIR%%/imaprc.txt. Particularly consider
changing mail-subdirectory to mail to have ~/mail the default mail
directory as is default in some MUAs, and to avoid having the whole home
dir accessed.

===>   NB: IMAP-UW now rejects non-encrypted logins by default. To change this
===>   behaviour, recompile and reinstall cclient and imap-uw ports with one of
===>   the following make variables defined:

WITHOUT_SSL - build without SSL/encryption support.
WITH_SSL_AND_PLAINTEXT - build with SSL/encryption support, but allow
non-encrypted logins.
