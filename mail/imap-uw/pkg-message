The ipop2d, ipop3d, and imapd daemons should be invoked by your
/etc/inetd.conf file with lines such as:

pop2    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/ipop2d   ipop2d
pop3    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/ipop3d   ipop3d
imap4   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/local/libexec/imapd    imapd

If PAM authentication support has been compiled in you may need to add the
following lines to /etc/pam.conf:

imap	auth	required	pam_unix.so			try_first_pass
imap	account	required	pam_unix.so			try_first_pass
pop	auth	required	pam_unix.so			try_first_pass
pop	account	required	pam_unix.so			try_first_pass
