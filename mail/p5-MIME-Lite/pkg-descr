MIME::Lite is intended as a simple, standalone module for generating
(not parsing!) MIME messages... specifically, it allows you to output a
simple, decent single- or multi-part message with text or binary
attachments. It does not require that you have the Mail:: or MIME::
modules installed.

To use the built-in SMTP interface (and thereby avoid calling sendmail) please
install the Net module through ports/net/p5-Net, or stand alone. This package
will contain the Net::SMTP code required.

If you need more sophisticated behaviour from MIME, please install the
MIME::tools package instead.
