Dbmail is the name of a group of programs that enable the possiblilty of storing
and retrieving mail messages from a database (currently MySQL or PostgreSQL).

What are the advantages?

    * Scalability.
      Dbmail is as scalable as the database that is used for the mail storage.
    * Manageability.
      Dbmail is based upon a database. Dbmail can be managed by changing
      settings in the database (f.e. using PHP/Perl/SQL).
    * Speed.
      Dbmail uses very efficient, database specific queries for retrieving mail
      information. This is much faster then parsing a filesystem.
    * Security.
      Dbmail has got nothing to do with the filesystem or interaction with other
      programs in the Unix environment which need special permissions.  Dbmail
      is as secure as the database it's based upon.
    * Flexibility.
      Changes on a Dbmail system (adding of users, changing passwords etc.) are
      effective immediately.
