XF-Mail is X-Windows application for receiving electronic mail. It was
created using XForms library toolkit by T.C. Zhao and Mark Overmars.

It's partially compatible with MH style mail boxes but it does not
require any MH tools to be installed on the system. You can read most
of your MH folders and messages with XF-Mail.

XF-Mail has very friendly user interface and it's extremely easy in
use. It implements most of the mail functionality in one program and
it does not require any additional tools.
