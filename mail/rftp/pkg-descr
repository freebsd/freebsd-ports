        This program is for any user who retrieves ftp files via
        ftpmail or bitftp servers.  It runs quietly in the background
        and watches the user's mail directory.  When the mail-
        retrieved file has arrived in full, rftp puts the pieces
        together in order and stores the tarball in a directory.

        I wrote this several years ago when my only link to the
        Arpanet was a uucp link.  These days, most FreeBSD users
        have a direct link to the net.  For the dozens or  hundreds
        who don't this should be of use.
