Evolution-exchange is a plugin for Evolution that adds Exchange client
capabilities to Evolution.

With Evolution-Exchange installed, Evolution functions as an
Exchange client, enabling users to become full participants in company-wide
group scheduling and other collaborative tasks. Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD

task lists, and group scheduling information.
