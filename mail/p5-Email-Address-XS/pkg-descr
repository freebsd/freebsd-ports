This module implements RFC 2822 parser and formatter of email addresses and
groups. It parses an input string from email headers which contain a list of
email addresses or a groups of email addresses (like From, To, Cc, Bcc,
Reply-To, Sender, ...). Also it can generate a string value for those headers
from a list of email addresses objects.

Parser and formatter functionality is implemented in XS and uses shared code
from Dovecot IMAP server.

It is a drop-in replacement for the Email::Address module which has several
security issues. Existing applications that use Email::Address module could be
easily switched to Email::Address::XS module. In most cases only changing use
Email::Address to use Email::Address::XS and replacing every Email::Address
occurrence with Email::Address::XS is sufficient.

So unlike Email::Address, this module does not use regular expressions for
parsing but instead native XS implementation parses input string sequentially
according to RFC 2822 grammar.

Additionally it has support also for named groups and so can be use instead of
the Email::Address::List module.
