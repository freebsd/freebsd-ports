No-Brainer SMTP is for people who just need a plain old SMTP outgoing delivery
system. Nothing as fancy as qmail or, heaven forbid, sendmail. It just has 3
required parameters (and 2 optional ones).

Usage:
nbsmtp -d domain -f from@addr -h host [-p port] [-l debuglevel]

domain: The domain you want nbsmtp to say it belongs to.  This will
almost invariably be the same as the domain in your email address.
from@addr: This is the address you want nbsmtp to say the message is from. Note
that this can be different than the "From:" line in your MUA.
host: This is the smtp server you are sending to.
port: The smtp port you want to connect to. 25 is standard, don't change it
unless you know what you are doing.
