A POP3 mail retriever with reliable Maildir and command delivery.

Summary of features:
- Retrieve mail from an unlimited number of POP3 mailboxes and servers. 
- Support for multidrop or domain mailboxes. 
- Safe and reliable delivery to qmail-style Maildirs, as well as program
  (pipe) delivery for use with arbitrary external MDAs. Includes an MDA
  for mbox files that supports mboxrd format and fcntl-type flock locking. 
- Does not destroy information by rewriting mail headers. 
- Does not cause mail loops by doing SMTP injection, and therefore does
  not require that you run an MTA (like qmail or sendmail) on your host. 
- Can remember which mail it has already retrieved, and can be set to
  only download new messages. 
- Written in Python, and therefore easy to extend or customize. 
- Simple to install, configure, and use.
