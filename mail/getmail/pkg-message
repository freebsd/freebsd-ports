=======================================================================

The getmail rc file (configuration file) format has changed since
version 3.x.  If you are upgrading from version 3, you will need
to write a new configuration file based on the contents of your old one.
The new file format resembles the old in many ways.

Each account you retrieve mail from will require a separate rc file,
but getmail can operate with multiple rc files simultaneously
if you wish to retrieve mail from multiple accounts.
