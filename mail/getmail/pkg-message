=======================================================================

The getmail rc file (configuration file) format has changed since 
version 3.x.  If you are upgrading from version 3, you will need 
to write a new configuration file based on the contents of your old one. 
The new file format resembles the old in many ways. 

Each account you retrieve mail from will require a separate rc file, 
but getmail can operate with multiple rc files simultaneously 
if you wish to retrieve mail from multiple accounts.
