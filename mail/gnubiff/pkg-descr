gnubiff is a mail notification program that checks for mail, displays
headers when new mail has arrived and allow to read first lines of
new mails.

It relies on the GNOME and GTK libraries but can be compiled and
used with or without GNOME support. Supported protocols are pop3,
apop, imap4, mh, qmail and mailfile.

Furthermore, gnubiff is fully configurable with a lot of options
like polltime, poptime, sounds, mail reader, mailbox names, etc.
and can also filter spam.
