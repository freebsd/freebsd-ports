Metamail is an implementation of MIME, the Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions, a proposed standard for multimedia mail on the Internet.
Metamail implements MIME, and also implements extensibility and
configuration via the "mailcap" mechanism described in an informational
RFC that is a companion to the MIME document.
