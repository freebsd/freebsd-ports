Archmbox is a simple email archiver written in Perl; it parses one or more
mailboxes, selects some or all messages and then performs specific actions
on the selected messages.  Archmbox supports mbox and mbx mailbox formats.

Four different modes are available:

  - List mode, which is useful to list all selected messages before
    archmbox performs the real operations (archiving or deleting)
  - Kill mode, if messages should be deleted from the mailbox(es) rather
    than archived
  - Archive mode, to archive the selected messages in a different mailbox
  - Copy mode, to copy the selected messages from the source mailbox

Messages selection is based upon a date criteria; an absolute date or days
offset can be specified.  It is also possible to refine the selection using
regular expressions on the header fields of the message.

All archived messages are stored in a new mailbox with the same name of the
original one plus .archived as extension (this is the default, but can be
changed); the archive mailbox can be saved in gz or bz2 compressed format
as well.
