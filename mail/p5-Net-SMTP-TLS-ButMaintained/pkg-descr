Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained is forked from Net::SMTP::TLS.

Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained is a TLS and AUTH capable SMTP client which
offers an interface that users will find familiar from Net::SMTP.
Net::SMTP::TLS::ButMaintained implements a subset of the methods provided
by that module, but certainly not (yet) a complete mirror image of that API.
