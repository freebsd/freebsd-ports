************************************************************************
IMP has been installed in %%IMPDIR%% with your blank
configuration files.

Horde must be configured and the tables created; if not, see
%%PORTSDIR%%/www/horde-devel/pkg-message.

Then, you will have to tune the configuration files located in
%%CONFDIR%%/, specially the files conf.php and
servers.php.

To protect your configuration files, you have to restart Apache.

IMP requires an IMAP server. If you want to install one on this
machine, you may install the ports mail/cyrus-imapd, or
mail/imap-uw, or mail/courier-imap.

To secure your installation, it is at least recommended that you change
the default database password used by horde and imp.
Then, you might change the 'session.save_path' setting in php.ini to a
directory only readable and writeable by your webserver.
