What is OpenEMM?

OpenEMM is a feature-rich web-based enterprise application for email
marketing, newsletters and service mails (transaction mails and
event or time triggered mails). OpenEMM offers a great user interface,
sophisticated bounce management, link tracking, lots of graphical
realtime statistics, a CMS module and a scripting feature to implement
individual tasks.

OpenEMM is the first open source application for e-mail marketing.
Its code base has been developed since 1999 and is used - as part
of the commercial software product E-Marketing Manager (EMM) - by
companies like IBM, Daimler, Siemens and Deutsche Telekom.

OpenEMM offers already more than 95% of the functionality of most
commercial products and some features most commercial products do
not offer right now (for example MySQL support and CMS functionality).
