biffer replaces and enhances the normal result of "biff(1)".  It
can forward notifications between machines and userids (even if
the mail recipient is not currently signed on), ignore messages
that match user-specified patterns in mail headers, do text or X
notifications, and also run an arbitrary program.

Needs a slight modification to the stock comsat, included here
as biffer_comsat.

Written at the University of Waterloo circa 1988, and in use since
then with some modifications.
