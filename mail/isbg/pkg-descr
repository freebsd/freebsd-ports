IMAP Spam Begone (isbg) is a script that makes it easy to scan
an IMAP inbox for spam using SpamAssassin and get your spam
moved to another folder.

Unlike the normal mode of deployments for SpamAssassin, isbg
does not need to be involved in mail delivery, and can run on
completely different machines to where your mailbox actually
is.
