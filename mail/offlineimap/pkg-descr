OfflineIMAP is a tool to simplify your e-mail reading.  With
OfflineIMAP, you can read the same mailbox from multiple computers.  You
get a current copy of your messages on each computer, and changes you
make one place will be visible on all other systems.  For instance, you
can delete a message on your home computer, and it will appear deleted
on your work computer as well.  OfflineIMAP is also useful if you want
to use a mail reader that does not have IMAP support, has poor IMAP
support, or does not provide disconnected operation.
