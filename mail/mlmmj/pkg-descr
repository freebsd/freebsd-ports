Mlmmj (Mailing List Management Made Joyful) is a simple and slim
mailing list manager (MLM) inspired by ezmlm. It works with many
different Mail Transport Agents (MTAs) and is simple for a system
adminstrator to install, configure and integrate with other software.
As it uses very few resources, and requires no daemons, it is ideal
for installation on systems where resources are limited, such as
Virtual Private Servers (VPSes).
