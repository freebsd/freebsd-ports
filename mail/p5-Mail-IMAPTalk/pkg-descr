This module communicates with an IMAP server. Each IMAP server command is 
mapped to a method of this object.

Although other IMAP modules exist on CPAN, this has several advantages 
over other modules.

    * It parses the more complex IMAP structures like envelopes and body 
structures into nice Perl data structures.
    * It correctly supports atoms, quoted strings and literals at any 
point. Some parsers in other modules aren't fully IMAP compatiable and may 
break at odd times with certain messages on some servers.
    * It allows large return values (eg. attachments on a message) to be 
read directly into a file, rather than into memory.
    * It includes some helper functions to find the actual text/plain or 
text/html part of a message out of a complex MIME structure. It also can 
find a list of attachements, and CID links for HTML messages with attached 
images.
    * It supports decoding of MIME headers to Perl utf-8 strings 
automatically, so you don't have to deal with MIME encoded headers 
(enabled optionally).

While the IMAP protocol does allow for asynchronous running of commands, 
this module is designed to be used in a synchronous manner. That is, you 
issue a command by calling a method, and the command will block until the 
appropriate response is returned. The method will then return the parsed 
results from the given command.
