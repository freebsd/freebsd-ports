To run hotwayd you need to add it to inetd.conf.
To use the standard pop3 port for hotwayd, add the following
line to /etc/inetd.conf:

pop3	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/sbin/hotwayd	hotwayd

You may also specify an arbitrary port for hotwayd.  Define it
in /etc/services, and then use a line like this in /etc/inetd.conf:

hotwayd	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/sbin/hotwayd	hotwayd

After making your changes, restart inetd. e.g.:

killall -HUP inetd

You can now use fetchmail or any pop3 mail client to read your e-mail.
The POP username should be your full hotmail or msn e-mail address,
and the password is your hotmail/msn password.
