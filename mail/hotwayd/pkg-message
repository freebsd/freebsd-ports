********************
hotwayd and hotsmtpd should normally be run from inetd (or xinetd).
To use the standard ports for pop3 and smtp, add lines like the
following to /etc/inetd.conf:

pop3	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/sbin/hotwayd	hotwayd
smtp	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/sbin/hotsmtpd hotsmtpd

Alternatively, you may specify arbitrary ports for hotwayd and hotsmtpd.
Define them in /etc/services, and then add lines like the following to
/etc/inetd.conf:

hotwayd	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/sbin/hotwayd	hotwayd
hotsmtpd stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/local/sbin/hotsmtpd hotsmtpd

After making your changes, restart inetd. e.g.:

killall -HUP inetd

You can now use fetchmail or any pop3 mail client to receive your
hotmail (or similar) e-mail. The username should be your full e-mail
address (e.g. example@hotmail.com), and the password is your your
password for hotmail (or whichever service you use).

For more detailed information see hotwayd(1), hotsmtpd(1), and the port
documentation in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/hotwayd.
