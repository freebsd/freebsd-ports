By default, P3Scan is configured to work with McAfee UVSCAN.
Please copy PREFIX/etc/p3scan.conf.sample to p3scan.conf and modify
PREFIX/etc/p3scan.conf and/or PREFIX/etc/rc.d/p3scan.sh to
fit your environment.

Don't forget to copy PREFIX/etc/p3scan.mail.sample to p3scan.mail
and edit your own template for virus notifications.

By the way, you need to enable IPFIREWALL and IPFIREWALL_FORWARD options
in kernel, and add the forwarding rule into your IPFW table,

# ipfw add fwd 192.168.0.254,8110 tcp from 192.168.0.0/24 to any pop3

while 192.168.0.254 is the IP of your internal interface, 8110 is the
default port of P3scan, and 192.168.0.0/24 is the IP range of your LAN.


Don't forget  chown -R <clamavuser> /var/run/p3scan /var/spool/p3scan
<clamavuser> must be same as in running clamd.
