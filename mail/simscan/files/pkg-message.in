NOTES:

* You have to configure your anti-virus and anti-spam products!

* You have to modify your qmail startup files to call simscan.
In most cases, you just need to edit %%QMAIL_PREFIX%%/tcp.smtp in
order to call simscan instead of qmail-queue, by setting up
QMAILQUEUE variable. For example:

127.0.0.1:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""
192.168.0.:allow,RELAYCLIENT="",QMAILQUEUE="%%QMAIL_PREFIX%%/bin/simscan"
:allow,QMAILQUEUE="%%QMAIL_PREFIX%%/bin/simscan"

* Don't forget to rebuild tcp.smtp.cdb from new tcp.smtp using tcprules!

* Also, read documentation about how to configure
attachment blocking and per domain processing.
