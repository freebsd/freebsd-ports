This is a sendmail filter, based on Milter API, intedned to do
spam control and canceling it. This is multi-thread small filter,
which sits between sendmail and local mail agent, checks all mail
by selected rules and cancels spam-qualified messages.

Main features:
- Charset controlling. No more unreadable mails in your box!
  You can selectively setup, which codepages for which users
  are allowed, mail with other codepages will declined
- HTML isolating. You can setup filter to check all incoming,
  outgoing or all (or none) mail to HTML mail and decline it.
  IMHO, HTML mail is a headache only. You can separately setup
  on per-user basis, which users can send HTML mail, which can
  receive

Any other features (content filtering, attachment checking) are
planned, but not imlemented this release.
