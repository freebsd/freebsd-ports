	RTFM before configuring and running Courier!!!

Check and/or modify the following configuration files to suit your needs:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/courierd
	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/esmtpd
	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/esmtpd-msa
	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/esmtpd-ssl
%%SENDFAX%%	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/faxcoverpage.tr
%%SENDFAX%%	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/faxnotifyrc
%%SENDFAX%%	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/faxrc
	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/imapd
	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/imapd-ssl
	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/ldapaddressbook
%%LDAP%%	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/ldapaliasrc
	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/pop3d
	%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/pop3d-ssl

Do not forget to update /etc/pam.d/ or /etc/pam.conf with the contents of
%%PREFIX%%/etc/courier/*.authpam.

To enable Courier-MTA to start at boot time, set these variables in your
/etc/rc.conf file:

	courier_enable="YES"
	sendmail_enable="NONE"

Note: as in newer OS versions NONE for sendmail_enable is deprecated and
will be not supported in future, use following instead:

	courier_enable="YES"
	sendmail_enable="NO"
	sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
	sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
	sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"

Usually editing /etc/mail/mailer.conf is necessary, too, so it contains
following lines:

	sendmail	%%PREFIX%%/bin/sendmail
	send-mail	%%PREFIX%%/bin/sendmail
	mailq		%%PREFIX%%/bin/mailq
	newaliases	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/makealiases

Also, you will want to disable some Sendmail specific daily maintenance
routines in your /etc/periodic.conf file:

	daily_clean_hoststat_enable="NO"
	daily_status_mail_rejects_enable="NO"
	daily_status_include_submit_mailq="NO"
	daily_submit_queuerun="NO"

Documentation (if installed locally) is located in %%DOCSDIR%%,
otherwise see http://www.Courier-MTA.org/

If you are planning to serve shared maildirs, then you should create a cron
job that runs at regular intervals (once every few hours is fine) that
executes the following script to update the shared folder index:

	%%PREFIX%%/share/courier/sharedindexupdate

VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE - unicode Maildirs:

For those:

  Updating Courier-IMAP to version 5.0, and later, from prior versions of Courier-IMAP, or:
  Updating SqWebmail to version 6.0, and later, from prior versions of SqWebmail, or:
  Updating Courier to version 1.0, and later, from prior versions of Courier. 

These versions have been updated to implement native Unicode support in several 
E-mail-related protocols.

Be absolutely sure to Read the instructions in the maildirmake
manual page (see "Converting pre-unicode format maildirs" at
http://www.courier-mta.org/maildirmake.html, or in the man page in
this package) about updating from earlier versions; specifically the
need to convert any existing maildirs to a Unicode naming scheme,
and the need to update any other Courier packages together with
updating this one.

This message is only meant to make sure you are aware of the contents
of the man page about updating from earlier versions, and the need for
manual steps to update any existing maildirs.

If you are installing for the first time, you can simply rerun configure
with this option.
