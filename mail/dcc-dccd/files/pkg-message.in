Installation Notes
------------------

Make certain you edit %%DCCHOME%%/dcc_conf to enable the daemons you
wish to run, in addition to adding their respective dcc*_enable="YES"
lines to /etc/rc.conf or /etc/rc.conf.local.

Daemon startup flags are also specified in %%DCCHOME%%/dcc_conf.


If you run the DCC server, %%LOCALBASE%%/dcc/libexec/cron-dccd should be
run at least daily from the crontab to clean old checksums from the DB.


If you just run the client, you may still wish to add
%%LOCALBASE%%/dcc/libexec/cron-dccd to your crontab to clean up the
client's log files on a regular basis. dcc_conf's DBCLEAN_LOGDAYS
variable controls the number of days to keep logs.


If your site handles more than 100,000 messages per day, to decrease the
load on the public DCC servers and increase the responsiveness of your
DCC clients, you should set up your own, local DCC server connected to
the global network of DCC servers.  See:
