automx makes setting up a mail account easy. All your users need to provide 
is real name, mail address and password. Their mail client and automx will 
safely handle the rest.

automx runs on your server and handles mail account profile requests from 
your mail clients. Put an end to endless phone calls trying to coach users to 
configure settings, whose dialogs they can't find. Stop wasting your time 
writing Tutorials nobody reads.

automx unifies Microsofts and Mozillas mail account provisioning standards in 
one powerful Open Source tool. Choose from many backends, including LDAP and 
SQL, and let automx create standard and individualized profiles for multiple 
domains on the fly!
