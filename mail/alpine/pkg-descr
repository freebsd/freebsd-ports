Alpine is a screen-oriented message-handling tool for news, and POP, IMAP,
and local e-mail.  In its default configuration it offers a limited set of
functions geared toward the novice user, but it also has a large list of
optional "power-user" and personal-preference features.

Alpine's basic feature set includes:
	* View, Save, Export, Delete, Print, Reply and Forward messages.
	    Compose messages in a simple editor with word-wrap and a
	    spelling checker.  Messages may be postponed for later completion.
	* Selection and management of message folders.
	* Address book to keep a list of long or frequently-used
	    addresses.  Personal distribution lists may be defined.
	    Addresses may be taken into the address book from incoming mail
	    without retyping them.
	* New mail checking/notification occurs automatically (configurable).
	* On-line, context-sensitive help screens.

Alpine supports MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), an Internet
Standard for representing multipart and multimedia data in email.
