TurboMail is a TurboGears extension, meaning that it starts up and
shuts down alongside any TurboGears applications you write, in the
same way that visit tracking and identity do.

TurboMail uses built-in Python modules for SMTP communication and
MIME e-mail creation, but greatly simplifies these tasks by performing
the grunt-work for you. Additionally, TurboMail is multi-threaded,
allowing for single or batch enqueueing and background delivery of mail.
