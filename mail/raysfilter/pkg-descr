   The configuration files, header-list.conf and string-list.conf control
   which message headers the filter examines and what strings it looks
   for in those headers. The filter will look for all of the specified
   strings in all of the specified headers.
   
   The configuration files can be changed while the filter is running.
   The mail-filter reset command is then used to signal the program to
   re-read the files.
