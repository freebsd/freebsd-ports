Easily ingest messages from POP3, IMAP, or local mailboxes
into your Django application.

This app allows you to either ingest e-mail content from common e-mail services
(as long as the service provides POP3 or IMAP support), or directly receive
e-mail messages from stdin (for locally processing messages
from Postfix or Exim4).
