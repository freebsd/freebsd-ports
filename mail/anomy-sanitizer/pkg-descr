The Anomy sanitizer is what most people would call 
"an email virus scanner". The most important jobs that the sanitizer 
can do for you - it can scan email attachments for viruses. 

Other things it can do:
- Disable potentially dangerous HTML code, such as javascript, 
  within incoming email.
- Protect you from email-based break-in attempts which exploit 
  bugs in common email programs (Outlook, Eudora, Pine, ...).
- Block or "mangle" attachments based on their file names. 
  This way if you don't need to recieve e.g. visual basic scripts, 
  then you don't have to worry about the security risk they imply 
  (the ILOVEYOU virus was a visual basic program). 
  This lets you protect yourself and your users from whole
  classes of attacks, instead of blocking individual exploits.
