This set of modules tries to provide a correct and usable
implementation of RFC 2047
"MIME Part Three: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text"

- As a replacement of 'text' tokens, for example in a Subject header
- As a replacement for a 'word' entity within a 'phrase',
  for example, one that precedes an address in a From,
  To, or Cc header
