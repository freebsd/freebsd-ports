Notmuch is a great mail indexing tool that can also be used
in conjunction with existing Mail User Agents (MUA) instead
of replacing them.  The advantage of such mixed solutions is
that users can benefit from Notmuch features (such as full-text
search and thread reconstruction) without having to change MUA.

The notmuch-mutt script bridges the gap between Notmuch and
Mutt.
