The OSSP lmtp2nntp program is an LMTP service for use in conjunction
with an MTA (like Sendmail), providing a reli- able real-time mail to
news gateway. Input messages get their headers slightly reformatted
to match Usenet news article format. The article is then posted or
feeded into a remote NNTP service (like INN). Delivery must take
place immediately or the transaction fails. OSSP lmtp2nntp relies
on the queuing capabilities of the MTA in order to provide a fully
reliable service. For this the program returns proper delivery status
notification which indi- cates successful completed action, persistent
transient failure or permanent failure.
