Edit /etc/rc.conf and set

  ovs_enable="YES"

to enable OpenVISP Stats.

Make sure this script should be invoked with privilege to read
/var/log/maillog. For example, you may change the permission of
maillog to be 644. Another way is to make maillog owned by
the mail group, and put ovs_user in that group.
