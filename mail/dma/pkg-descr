The DragonFly Mail Agent is a small Mail Transport Agent (MTA),
designed for home and office use.  It accepts e-mail messages
from locally installed Mail User Agents (MUA) and delivers the
messages either locally or to a remote destination.  Remote
delivery includes several features like TLS/SSL support and
SMTP authentication, but not MX record lookups.  Therefore,
dma is currently not suitable for direct remote delivery.
However, it works very well for handling local mail plus
secure mail submission to a remote smarthost (e.g. for
travelling mobile computers).

Since dma is not intended as a replacement for real, big MTAs
like sendmail(8) or postfix(1), it does not listen on port 25
for incoming connections.
