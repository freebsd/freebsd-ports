exmh is a TCL/TK based interface to the MH mail system.  It provides
the usual layer on top of MH commands, as well as many other features:

    MIME support!  Displays richtext and enriched directly.
    Color feedback in the scan listing.
    A colour coded folder display with one label per folder.
    Smart scan caching.  News read/post.  koi8-r support.
    Facesaver bitmap display.  Ispell support.
    Background inc.  You can set exmh to run inc periodically.
    Searching over folder listing and message body.
    A dialog-box interface to MH pick.
    An editor with emacs-like bindings and MIME support.
    Glimpse interface.  You can index all your mail with glimpse
       and search for messages by content.
    User preferences.  You can tune exmh through a dialog box.
    User hacking support.  A user library of TCL routines is supported.

IMPORTANT: exmh depends on the TK send facility for its background
processing.  With TK 3.3, send now uses xauthority mechanisms by default,
unless you compile TK with -DTK_NO_SECURITY.  Generally, this means that
you **MUST** must run xdm to start your Xserver.
