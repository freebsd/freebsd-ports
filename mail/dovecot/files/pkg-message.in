 You must create the configuration files yourself. Copy them over
 to %%ETCDIR%% and edit them as desired:

 	cp -R %%ETCDIR%%/example-config/* \
 		%%ETCDIR%%

 The default configuration includes IMAP and POP3 services, will
 authenticate users agains the system's passwd file, and will use
 the default /var/mail/$USER mbox files.

 Next, enable dovecot in /etc/rc.conf:

 	dovecot_enable="YES"


 To avoid a risk of mailbox corruption, do not set the
 security.bsd.see_other_uids or .see_other_gids sysctls to 0
 if Dovecot is storing mail for multiple concurrent users (PR 218392).

 Similarly, setting sysctls security.bsd.hardlink_check_uid or
 security.bsd.hardlink_check_gid to 1 might result in non-working
 mailboxes, depending on what mailbox locking mechanism is used
 (PR 242223).

 If you want to be able to search within attachments using the
 decode2text plugin, you'll need to install textproc/catdoc, and
 one of graphics/xpdf or graphics/poppler-utils.


 There are some potentially breaking changes in Dovecot 2.3. If you
 are upgrading from Dovecot 2.2:
 
   * Read https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Upgrading/2.3
   * Merge the configuration file changes from
