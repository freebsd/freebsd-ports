The Qmail virus scanner (QScan) is a mail filter for Qmail that scans
incoming messages using the Clam Antivirus engine, immediately rejecting
infected content.

It is designed to be minimalistic, yet extremely fast and secure, and uses
multiple pipes instead of the traditional temporary files and privilege
separation.

Originally developed for the Sophos Antivirus, this port is patched to
work in conjunction with the ClamAV daemon.
