 This port assumes you are familiar with Dovecot and have it installed
 and running on the system you have installed this service on.

 You can enable the service with this directive in your dovecot.conf:

     protocol managesieve {
	sieve=~/.dovecot.sieve
	sieve_storage=~/sieve
     }

 And don't forget to add "managesieve" to the "protocols" setting
 if you use it.

 Further information on configuration can be found at:
