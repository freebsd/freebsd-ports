Before running these rules please do the following:

1. Read any extra info available with the rules, including the comments
   in the .cf files.
2. Check to make sure that the default scores in these rules fit your
   installation. You might want to modify scores.
3. Make sure to --lint the rules after loading them.
4. Test the new rulesets. Keep an eye on hits from the new rules to
   determine if the scoring is right for you.
