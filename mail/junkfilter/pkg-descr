junkfilter is a set of interlaced procmail scripts whose purpose is
to filter spam, or junk email.  It requires nothing other than
procmail, and takes no overt action upon classifying a message.  All
action is left up to the user, although examples are provided.

Modules include:
	numerous header checks
	a phrase checker for the message body
	an address filter
	a dialup filter
	a domain filter
	an IP filter
