In case you use authpam, you should put the following lines
in your /etc/pam.d/imap:

auth    required    pam_unix.so         try_first_pass
account required    pam_unix.so         try_first_pass
session required    pam_permit.so

You will have to run %%DATADIR%%/mkimapdcert to create
a self-signed certificate if you want to use imapd-ssl.
And you will have to copy and edit the *.dist files to *
in %%CONFDIR%%.
