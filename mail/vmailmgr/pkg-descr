VMailMgr (short for Virtual MAIL ManaGeR) is a package of programs designed to
manage multiple domains of mail addresses and mailboxes on a single host. It
co-operates with qmail for mail delivery and program control. It features:

    * A password checking interface between qmail-popup and qmail-pop3d which
    replaces the usual checkpassword, as well as an authentication module for
    Courier IMAP, that provide access to the virtual mailboxes by one of three
    methods:
          o IP-based virtual server access (invisible to the POP3 user)
          o username-based access (username-virtualuser)
          o hostname-based access (virtualuser@virtual.host or
            virtualuser:virtual.host)
    * CDB-based password tables to speed up access for domains of any size.
    * Tools to setup a virtual domain, add and delete individual virtual users
      and aliases, and to change passwords.  CGI programs to accomplish the
    * above tasks from a set of web pages.
    * A native PHP library to complement or replace the CGIs.
    * A daemon process that securely directs the operation of the CGIs and PHP
      code.
    * A separate delivery agent that automatically deals with any address
      inside a virtual domain from a single .qmail-default file.
