1.  phplist needs a MySQL database in order to operate.
You can create this database by using something like  the following commands:

% mysqladmin -pu root create phplist
% mysql -pu root
mysql> grant all privileges on phplist.* to phplist@localhost identified by
'your_secure_password';

2.  In order to get Apache or your preferred web server to recognise
    phplist's location on your disk, you'll need to put the following line
    (or the equivalent) into the web server configuration:

Alias /phplist %%WWWDIR%%
<Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
</Directory>

3.  The phplist configuration file, edit:

%%WWWDIR%%/lists/config/config.php

    phplist will not operate correctly unless you spend some time setting
    correct options in this file.

4.  You should now be able to log into your phplist installation by pointing
    your browser at: http://www.example.com/lists/admin/.  phplist includes
    a web based configuration system which will guide you through all the
    steps required for creating a useful phplist installation.

5.  Please see the documentation directory (%%DOCSDIR%%)
    for full documentation on how to get the best out of phplist.
