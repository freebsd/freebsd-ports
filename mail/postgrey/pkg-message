NETWORK LISTENER WARNING
------------------------

By default, the startup script specifies "--inet=10023" in postgrey_flags.
This makes postgrey listen on localhost TCP port 10023.  If you want to use a
unix socket, a different port, or an external interface, please see the
postgrey(1) man page about the use of the --inet and --unix flags and set
postgrey_flags as appropriate.


THIRD-PARTY DISCLOSURE WARNING
------------------------------

The default text used when postgrey returns a "greylisted" response includes a
URL of the form:

http://postgrey.schweikert.ch/help/example.com.html

where example.com is the FQDN of the RCPT TO address of the greylisted message.
This is a potential information disclosure in the following ways:

- Indicates you are using David Schweikert's postgrey;
- Someone who goes to that link may disclose to the website's operator that
  they sent email to your domain.

If you do not want this behaviour, you can override the default text by
setting --greylist-text in postgrey_flags.  An example of a generic setting
would be --greylist-text='4.7.1 Greylisted'.

Please see the "Greylist Text" section of the postgrey(1) man page for more
information.
