                  **** NOTE ****
Before the first use of WordPress, copy wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php
in ${WWWDIR} and modify it to fit your MySQL.
Maybe you need 'mysqladmin create wordpress' first.
If you are upgrading from 1.x or 2.x to 3.x, please run
http://your.site/wordpress/wp-admin/upgrade.php to upgrade to WordPress 3.x
