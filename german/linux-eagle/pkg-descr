The EAGLE Layout Editor is an easy to use, yet powerful tool for designing
printed circuit boards (PCBs). The name EAGLE is an acronym, which stands for
Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor.

The program consists of three main modules:

o Layout Editor
o Schematic Editor
o Autorouter

which are embedded in a single user interface. Therefore there is no need for
converting netlists between schematics and layouts.

This is a Light Freeware Edition. It has the following limitations:

o The useable board area is limited to 100 x 80 mm (4 x 3.2 inches).
o Only two signal layers can be used (Top and Bottom).
o The schematic editor can only create one sheet.
o Support is only available via email or through our forum (no fax or phone
  support).
o Use is limited to non-profit applications or evaluation purposes.

Apart from these limitiations the EAGLE Light Edition can do anything the
Professional Edition can do. You can even load, view and print drawings that
exceed these limits!
