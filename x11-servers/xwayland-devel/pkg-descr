Wayland is a complete window system in itself, but even so, if we're
migrating away from X, it makes sense to have a good backwards
compatibility story. With a few changes, the Xorg server can be
modified to use wayland input devices for input and forward either the
root window or individual top-level windows as wayland surfaces. The
server still runs the same 2D driver with the same acceleration code
as it does when it runs natively. The main difference is that wayland
handles presentation of the windows instead of KMS.
