This module provides a simple way to handle transactions sent to WorldPay
for payment when using the WorldPay Select Junior service.

This module aims for simplicity. All it does is track the transaction and
then verify the callback data supplied by WorldPay after a payment has been
made. The module is designed with the requirement to immediately verify that
a payment has been made and is as expected in mind.
