 FrontAccounting has been installed into the following directory:
 %%WWWDIR%%

 Be sure to adjust your web server's configuration to allow you to
 access that directory.

 For example create a conf file (FA.conf) in the Apache Includes 
 directory (/usr/local/etc/apache24/Includes) containing the 
 following:

        Alias /frontaccounting /usr/local/www/frontaccounting24/
        <Directory /usr/local/www/frontaccounting24/>
                Require all granted
                DirectoryIndex index.php
        </Directory>

        Adjust the "Require all granted" statement to suit your 
        security needs in your environment.

 Session Data will be stored by default for this port within:
   %%WWWDIR%%/tmp
 
 Adjust the session settings as you require beginning on line 434 
 in:
     %%WWWDIR%%/tmp/session.inc
