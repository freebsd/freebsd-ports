This module generates commands for the Epson RP-U420 invoice printer for
printing the Unified Invoice in Taiwan.

You must install the driver and printer processor properly before you can
use the module.

You can define multiple lines of headers that will appear on each page of
the printed invoices, and when you do println the module does all the
necessary paging and stamping for you.
