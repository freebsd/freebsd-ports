FinanceToolkit is an open-source toolkit in which all relevant financial
ratios (180+), indicators and performance measurements are written down in the
most simplistic way allowing for complete transparency of the calculation method
(proof). This allows you to not have to rely on metrics from other providers
and, given a financial statement, allow for efficient manual calculations. This
leads to one uniform method of calculation being applied that is available and
understood by everyone.

The Finance Toolkit not only supports Equities. Even for Options, Currencies,
Cryptocurrencies, ETFs, Mutual Funds, Indices, Money Markets, Commodities, Key
Economic Indicators and more, the Finance Toolkit can be used to obtain
historical data as well as important performance and risk measurements such as
the Sharpe Ratio and Value at Risk.

The Finance Toolkit is complimented very well with the Finance Database, a
database that features 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs, Funds,
Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets. By utilising both,
it is possible to do a fully-fledged competitive analysis with the tickers found
from the FinanceDatabase inputted into the FinanceToolkit.
