Kraft is a free software project that helps to create office documents
especially for small enterprise operators such as handcrafters. These
features are provided:

 - Customer management, deeply integrated in the KDE infrastructure
   using KAddressbook
 - Automatted creation of offers, invoices and similar documents
 - Text templates
 - Material management

Kraft comes with a very clear and simple user interface. The central
form to work on a document provides a good overview over the entire
document but avoids overwhelming display of not needed information.
In the Focus there is always the currently important area such as
document header, item list or document footer.

Kraft supports calculated items in documents, items with manually
entered pricing and On-Demand and alternative items.
Documents can be copied completely to shorten the step to create similar
documents. Followup documents such as an invoice following an offer can
be created from the predocuments easily.
