Beanie is a flexible, distributed accounting system for medium-sized
companies. It includes back-end batch processing as well as a
(skeleton) GTK GUI and provides automated purchases, sales, and
nominal ledgers as well as automated invoicing (via email). It also
supports VAT and payroll.

The latest version has considerable updates over the earlier releases
and isn't particularly backwards-compatible. The installation and
compilation is streamlined and the multi-database schema has been
reduced to a single database per company. The gnome GUI is still
lacking, but the command-line interface now has support for automated
bank reconciliation (from online banking QIF files), payroll,
automated billing and reminders, invoice PDF generation, statement
PDF generation, and a general journal.
