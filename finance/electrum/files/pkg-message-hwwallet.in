For hardware wallet devices to work you need to be in the operator group
and need r/w permissions to the appropriate /dev/usb/* device.

Add a user to operator group:

% pw groupmod operator -m satoshi

Edit your configuration:

%%PREFIX%%/etc/devd/*_wallet.conf

Then restart devd to load the new rules:

% /etc/rc.d/devd restart
