rcheckbook is a CLI based ledger to help you keep track of finances,
with import and export support for the following formats:

* JSON (bcheck)
* Excel (xlsx)
* ODS
* TSV
* QIF

This CAN be used in conjunction with the iOS app BCheckbook,
but it only supports bcheck, TSV, and QIF, unlike this program.
