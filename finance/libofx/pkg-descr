LibOFX is a parser and an API designed to allow applications to
very easily support OFX command responses, usually provided by
financial institutions for statement downloads.

LibOFX was implemented directly from the full OFX 1.6 spec, and
currently supports:

- Banking transactions and statements
- Credit card and statements
- Investment transactions
- OFX 2.0

Future projects for LibOFX include:

- Header parsing
- DTD autodetection
- Currency conversion
- QIF import
- QIF export (integrated inside the library)
- OFX export
