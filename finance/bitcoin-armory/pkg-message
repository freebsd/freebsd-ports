================================================================
BitcoinArmory consumes significant disk space in ~/.armory
and ~/.bitcoin, so you need to provide sufficient available
space there, currently >50 gigabytes.

Please note that BitcoinArmory requires bitcoind daemon, so you
need to have either net-p2p/bitcoin-daemon or net-p2p/bitcoin
installed.

Please keep your *.wallet files located under the ~/.armory
directory secure. Loss of these files is equivalent to the loss
of money.
