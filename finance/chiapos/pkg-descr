Chia's proof of space is written in C++. Includes a plotter, prover, and
verifier. It exclusively runs on 64 bit architectures. Read the Proof of
Space document to learn about what proof of space is and how it works.

Notes:
i386 is not supported, and would be too slow for practical use if supported.

This port is for the cmake build (binaries).
