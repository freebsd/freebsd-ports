Nextcloud Cospend is a group/shared budget manager. 
It was inspired by the great IHateMoney.
You can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, 
whenever you share money with others.
It lets you create projects with members and bills. 
Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. 
This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. 
Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you 
which payments to make to reset members balances.
Project members are independent from Nextcloud users. 
Projects can be accessed and modified by people without a Nextcloud account. 
Each project has an ID and a password for guest access.
MoneyBuster Android client is available in F-Droid and on the Play store.
PayForMe iOS client is currently being developped!
