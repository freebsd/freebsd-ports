Hyperledger Fabric is intended as a foundation for developing applications or
solutions with a modular architecture. Hyperledger Fabric allows components,
such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play. Its modular and
versatile design satisfies a broad range of industry use cases. It offers a
unique approach to consensus that enables performance at scale while preserving
