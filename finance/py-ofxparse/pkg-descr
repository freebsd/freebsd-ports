ofxparse is a parser for Open Financial Exchange (.ofx) format files. OFX
files are available from almost any online banking site, so they work well if
you want to pull together your finances from multiple sources. Online trading
accounts also provide account statements in OFX files.

There are three different types of OFX files, called BankAccount,
CreditAccount and InvestmentAccount files. This library has been tested with
real-world samples of all three types. If you find a file that does not work
with this library, please consider contributing the file so ofxparse can be
improved. See the Help! section below for directions on how to do this.
