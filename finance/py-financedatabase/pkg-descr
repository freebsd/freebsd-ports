financedatabase is a database of 300.000+ symbols containing Equities, ETFs,
Funds, Indices, Currencies, Cryptocurrencies and Money Markets.

As a private investor, the sheer amount of information that can be found on the
internet is rather daunting. Trying to understand what type of companies or ETFs
are available is incredibly challenging with there being millions of companies
and derivatives available on the market. Sure, the most traded companies and
ETFs can quickly be found simply because they are known to the public (for
example, Microsoft, Tesla, S&P500 ETF or an All-World ETF). However, what else
is out there is often unknown.
