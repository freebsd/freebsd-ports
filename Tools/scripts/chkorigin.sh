# PKGORIGIN connects packaged or installed ports to the directory they
# originally came from. Although often overlooked, they are extremly
# important for tools like pkg_version or portupgrade to work correctly.
# Wrong PKGORIGINs are usually caused by a wrong order of CATEGORIES
# after a repocopy.
#
# This tool checks all ports in the ports tree (even those not connected
# to the build) for a wrong PKGORIGIN. Run this tool periodically and
# after every repocopy and correct errors immediately.
#
# Usage:
#   [env PORTSDIR=/usr/ports] chkorigin.sh [category ...]
