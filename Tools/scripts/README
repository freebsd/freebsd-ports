NOTE: These scripts need work and are *NOT* safe to use unless you know
      what they do.  Use at your own risk.  Patches would be great, but
      it is preferred they pass through the maintainer of each particular
      script.

MOVEDlint.awk - checks MOVED for common errors
ardiff	- compare two archives easily
bad-pkgdescrs.sh - locate identical pkg descriptions
bump_revision.pl - Small script to bump the PORTREVISION variable of ports
                   which are depending on a port with a changed shared lib
                   version.
checkcats.py - verify that master categories in all ports are correct and
               report any problems. Beware that the full check takes quite
			   some time.
checknewver.sh - checks for availability for a newest version of distfiles on
               MASTER_SITES (ftp only).
checksum.sh  - allows checking of ports to see if their checksums
			match, and if they don't, give a diff against the older version to
			help discover why the checksum didn't match.
chkorigin.sh - checks all ports in the tree for a wrong PKGORIGIN.
               Run this tool after every repocopy.
doportlint - run portlint on every port and return the results
distclean.sh - compare sha256 sums of distfiles in ports/distfiles with currently
            installed ports collection in ports/* and prompt to remove
            unmatched entries
getpatch - downloads patch attachments from a Bug Tracking Systems
getpatch.sh - downloads patch attachments from a Bug Tracking Systems (plain shell script)
mark_safe.pl - utility to set subsets of ports to MAKE_JOBS_(UN)SAFE=yes
neededlibs.sh - Extract direct library dependencies from binaries.
port_conflicts_check.lua - Verify that files installed by more than 1 port are covered
               in CONFLICTS or CONFLICTS_INSTALL entries (and generate portedit commands
	       to fix those issues)x
portsearch - A utility for searching the ports tree. It allows more detailed
             search criteria than ``make search key=<string>'' and accepts
             all perl(1) regular expressions.
search_lib_depends_and_bump.sh - Give it a port that has changed and it will bump
				 all ports having a LIB_DEPENDS on this port
splitpatch.pl - A small script to convert multi-file patches to several
                appropriately named single-file patches.
tindex - script used to build INDEXes for supported FreeBSD branches, which
         are the source of the 'make fetchindex' INDEXes, and the build
         failure reports on ports@FreeBSD.org
update_crates - script used to generate an updated Makefile using make cargo-crates
                output

portsearch - A utility for searching the ports tree.

     portsearch is a utility to for searching of the ports tree. It permits
     much more detailed searches to be performed than ``make search
     key=<string>'' by allowing you to specify which field(s) to search. It
     also supports all valid perl(1) regular expressions for pattern matching.

     portsearch displays matching ports in the same format as ``make search''
     and also displays the number of matching ports found.

     The following command line options are supported:

	   -h	      Prints a multi-line help message and exits

	   -n name    Search for name in the name field

	   -p path    Search for path in the path field

	   -i info    Search for info in the comments field

	   -m maint   Search for maint in the Maintainer field

	   -x index   Search for index in the category field

	   -b b_deps  Search for b_deps in the build-depends field

	   -r r_deps  Search for r_deps in the run-depends field

	   -d deps    Search for deps in the both the build and run dependency
		      fields. This option behaves differently to the other op-
		      tions, see the EXAMPLES section

	   -f file    Use the index file instead of /usr/ports/INDEX

     All searches are case-insensitive

See the file README.portsearch for further information.
