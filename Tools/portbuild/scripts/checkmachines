# Runs in the background on the server.  This script keeps track of
# the relative loads of the client machines, and specifies which machine(s)
# should be handed new jobs, according to the following algorithm:
#
# For each machine listed in ${buildroot}/mlist, check whether its load
# information has been updated in the last 15 seconds (should be updated by
# the reportload script every 5 seconds).  If so, then divide the number of
# running jobs on the client by its weighting in mlist, and output the
# machine(s) with the minimum value to ${buildroot}/ulist.
#
# Dividing by the weight has the effect of grouping machines with similar
# job load (e.g. a weight of 5 will rank machines with job loads 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
# as the same; if the machines all had a weight of 1 then it would only
# choose the machine with the least value of the job load, and would probably
# choose a single machine most of the time).
