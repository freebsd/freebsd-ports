# Keywords:
# chroot : successfully claimed a chroot
# setup  : we own the rights to setup the build env
# wait   : someone else is setting up the build env

# In case of other error, just exit.

# XXX if the setupnode process was a single process invocation we
# could use a lockf lock, and be able to tell if the setup process was
# still running or died prematurely
