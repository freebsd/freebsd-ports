# FreeBSD Ports Collection Contribution Guidelines

Contributions may be submitted to the FreeBSD Ports Collection via one of three methods:

- Attachments to [Bugzilla tickets](https://bugs.freebsd.org) are preferred, as this notifies existing maintainers.
- Code reviews on [Phabricator](https://reviews.freebsd.org/differential) are accepted by some maintainers.
- GitHub Pull Requests are an experimental feature and should expect additional delay.

To learn more about contributing to the FreeBSD Ports Collection, please see the [Porter's Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/) section on [Submitting patches](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/quick-porting/#porting-submitting).
