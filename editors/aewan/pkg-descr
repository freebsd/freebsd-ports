Aewan is a multi-layered ascii-art/animation editor that
produces both stand-alone cat-able art files and an
easy-to-parse format for integration in your terminal
applications.

Aewan is a curses-based program that allows for the creation
and editing of ascii art. The user is able to move the cursor
around the screen by means of the arrow keys and 'paint'
characters by pressing the corresponding keys. There are dialog
boxes that allow the user to choose foreground and background
colors, as well as bold and blink attributes. The user may also
select rectangular areas of the canvas in order to move, copy
and paste them. Aewan also supports 'intelligent' horizontal
and vertical flipping (e.g. converts '\' to '/', etc).
