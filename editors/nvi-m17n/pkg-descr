This ports contains multilingualized nex/nvi.

nex/nvi is a freely redistributable implementation of ex/vi text
editors originally distributed as part of the Fourth Berkeley
Software Distribution (4BSD), by the University of California,
Berkeley.

Multilingual patch enables you to use the following multilingual
encoding methods, such as:
	none iso-8859-[1234789] latin1 latin2
	euc-jp-1978 euc-jp euc-jp-1983 euc-jp-1990 euc-cn euc-kr
	iso-2022-cn iso-2022-jp iso-2022-kr
	iso-2022-7-1 iso-2022-7-2 iso-2022-8-2
	sjis big5 hz euc-tw
Multilingual support has been set up to use some of the above (guess from
the name of the ports/packages) as default value.
You can change encoding style on the fly, or by setting up ~/.exrc.
With configurations, for Japanese encodings, you can also enjoy the
embedded canna support.
See /usr/local/share/vi/README.* for details of multilingual patch.
