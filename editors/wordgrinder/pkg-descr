WordGrinder is an ultra-clean and uncluttered word processor
that runs in a terminal or an X11 window.

The author made WordGrinder to have something to write novels
on. It supports just enough character and paragraph style support
to let you get the job done, while not enough to let you waste
time configuring them.
