dhex is a more than just another hex editor: It includes a diff mode, which can
be used to easily and conveniently compare two binary files. Since it is based
on ncurses and is themeable, it can run on any number of systems and scenarios.
With its utilization of search logs, it is possible to track changes in
different iterations of files easily.
