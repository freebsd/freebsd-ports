Vertico provides a performant and minimalistic vertical completion UI
based on the default completion system. The focus of Vertico is to
provide a UI which behaves correctly under all circumstances. By
reusing the built-in facilities system, Vertico achieves full
compatibility with built-in Emacs completion commands and completion
tables. Vertico only provides the completion UI but aims to be highly
flexible, extendable and modular. Additional enhancements are
available as extensions or complementary packages. The code base is
small and maintainable. The main vertico.el package is only about 600
lines of code without white space and comments.
