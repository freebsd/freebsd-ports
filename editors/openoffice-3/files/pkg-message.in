OpenOffice.org %%RELEASE_NR%% will soon been installed in
%%PREFIX%%/%%EXECBASE%%

1. User installation
--------------------

Just type "%%EXECBASE%%" after you have successfully
installed the package. If there is no installed
OO.org dir in your homedir, you'll be prompted to
install some files and choose an installed JDK.
The setup installs a ".openoffice.org2" folder
in your homedir.

2. Starting OO.org
------------------

There are some wrappers installed for faster startup.
Add "%%PREFIX%%/bin/" to your PATH and you will be able
to use them.

%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sagenda
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-scalc
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sdraw
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-setup
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sfax
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-simpress
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-spadmin
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sweb
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-swriter

OO.org does need $LANG to be set to a suitable value.

3. If you run into problems
--------------------------------------------------
If you somehow run into problems, please remove the already installed
".openoffice.org2" dir in your homedir. Redo the user
installation and the problems should go away.

4. Known issue
--------------------------------------------------
If you invoke English version of OOo setting LANG as C or not
setting LANG environment,
`I18N: Operating system doesn't support locale "en_US"'
in this case you should set LANG as en_US.ISO8859-15
or en_US.ISO8859-1.
