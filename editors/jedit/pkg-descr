easy to use, intuitive interface, and enough features and flexibility to please
even the most hard-core programmer. A very incomplete list of jEdit's features
follows.

o Powerful search and replace - supports regular expressions and multiple file
  search/replace; Search and replace operations can be recorded in macros
o Any number of strings and caret positions can be stored for later use in
  so-called registers
o Rectangular selections for working with column-based files
o Any number of editor windows can be opened, and each view can be split into
  multiple panes for side-by-side viewing of multiple files
