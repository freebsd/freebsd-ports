JOE is the professional freeware ASCII text screen editor for UNIX.  It makes
full use of the power and versatility of UNIX, but lacks the steep learning
curve and basic nonsense you have to deal with in every other UNIX editor. JOE
has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: the key-sequences are reminiscent of
WordStar and Turbo-C.  JOE is much more powerful than those editors, however.
JOE has all of the features a UNIX user should expect:  full use of
termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update optimizations (JOE is fully usable at
2400 baud), simple installation, and all of the UNIX-integration features of
VI.

JOE now has UTF-8 support and Syntax Highlighting.
