The Multilingual Input Method - Egg V4

This enables you to input Multilingual Characters.

Tamago is only coded by emacs lisp.

This input method is working with various translation servers 
(i.e. jserver, cserver, tserver, Wnn6, SJ3 ver 1 and ver 2,
      cannaserver and wxgserver).

This package also includes enhancements from Debian, some of which are:

- Partial support for Wnn7/Wnn8.
- Support connection to cannaserver using UNIX domain socket.
