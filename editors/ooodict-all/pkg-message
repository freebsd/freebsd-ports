First, check if $LANG is set in your environment. Set
it to the appropriate value.

Now, start up OpenOffice.org, and go to:

Tools->Options->LanguageSettings->WritingAids

Hit "Edit" and use the pull down menu to select your locale
and then make sure to check the MySpell Spell Checker for
that locale.
