Pragtical is a code editor which was forked from Lite XL, written mostly in
Lua with a focus on being practical rather than minimalist.  The name of the
editor is a mixture of the words `pragmatic' and `practical', two words that
properly define the project's development approach and differentiate it from
its ancestors by striving to make Pragtical an editor that has amplified the
set of features, better out of the box experience, while keeping an eye on
performance and ease of extensibility.
