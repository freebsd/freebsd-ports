SLIME is a new Emacs mode for Common Lisp development.  Inspired by
existing systems such Emacs Lisp and ILISP, we are working to create a
fresh new environment for hacking Common Lisp in.

Features:
    * slime-mode: An Emacs minor-mode to enhance lisp-mode with:
          o Code evaluation, compilation, and macroexpansion.
          o Online documentation (describe, apropos, hyperspec).
          o Definition finding (aka Meta-Point aka M-.).
          o Symbol and package name completion.
          o Automatic macro indentation based on &body.
          o Cross-reference interface (WHO-CALLS, etc).
          o ... and more.
    * SLDB: Common Lisp debugger with an Emacs-based user interface.
    * REPL: The Read-Eval-Print Loop ("top-level") is written in Emacs
      Lisp for tighter integration with Emacs. The REPL also has
      builtin "shortcut" commands similar those of the McCLIM
      Listener.
    * Compilation notes: SLIME is able to take compiler messages and
      annotate them directly into source buffers.
    * Inspector: Interactive object-inspector in an Emacs buffer.
