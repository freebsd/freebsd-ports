The xi editor project is an attempt to build a high quality text
editor, using modern software engineering techniques.

Goals include:
- Incredibly high performance.  All editing operations should commit
  and paint in under 16ms.  The editor should never make you wait for
  anything.
- Beauty.  The editor should fit well on a modern desktop, and not look
  like a throwback from the '80s or '90s.  Text drawing should be done
  with the best technology available (Core Text on Mac, DirectWrite on
  Windows, etc.), and support Unicode fully.
- Reliability.  Crashing, hanging, or losing work should never happen.
- Developer friendliness.  It should be easy to customize xi editor,
  whether by adding plug-ins or hacking on the core.
