Consult provides search and navigation commands based on the Emacs
completion function completing-read documented in the Elisp
manual. Completion allows you to quickly select an item from a list of
candidates. Consult offers asynchronous and interactive consult-grep
and consult-ripgrep commands, and the line-based search command
consult-line. Furthermore Consult provides an advanced buffer
switching command consult-buffer to switch between buffers, recently
opened files, bookmarks and buffer-like candidates from other
sources. Some of the Consult commands are enhanced versions of
built-in Emacs commands. For example the command consult-imenu
presents a flat list of the Imenu with live preview, grouping and
narrowing.

Consult is fully compatible with completion systems centered around
the standard Emacs completing-read API, Vertico, Mct, and the built-in
default completion system and Icomplete.
