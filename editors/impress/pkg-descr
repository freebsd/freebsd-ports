ImPress is the WYSIWYG Publishing and Presentation for UNIX.
It can also be used within a WWW browser (e.g. Netscape) that is
capable of running the Tcl Plugin.  The Tcl Plugin can be obtained from
the web site at: http://dev.scriptics.com/

ImPress can be significantly enhanced through use of several modified utilities:
 o Pstoedit - Allows you to translate EPS files to Tk for ImPress use.
 o Font3D - Translates TrueType font strings to vectorized Tk.
 o Type1inst - Aids in maintaining Ghostscript Fontmaps and X11 fonts.dir files.
