# 2016-11-14: Email from Prof. (em.) John Rupley
# As far as I am concerned, the code is public domain, with no
# restrictions.  Steven List, in his README for the original
# distribution, said that the original author, Garry Johnson, gave him
# permission to place the code in the public domain.  So, do whatever
# you will with bpatch.  Nice to know it may still have a life.
