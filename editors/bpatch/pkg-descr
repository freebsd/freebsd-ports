Original code written by Garry M. Johnson and Steven Lisk.

This is a neat program that contains some neat code.  It allows you
to dump or edit files (binary or ascii), displayed by 256-byte records
in side-by-side hex and ascii formats.  Other features (eg. toggled
swap within byte pairs) are included.

The most interesting feature of this editor is that it doesn't load the
entire file at once, unlike all other hex editors.  Thus, you can browse
and edit very large files or even raw disks.

The program does not include a redistribution notice, but it was posted
to comp.sources.unix ages ago, and the README mentions the word "public
domain".
