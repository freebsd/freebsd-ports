Hexedit is a Curses based Hex editor.  Unlike a text editor, which
is used for editing text documents in the desired language, hexedit
lets you edit any file as its byte for byte representation.  It can
even let you view and edit your fixed disks on your Linux system.  This
is not ideal for writing a letter or writing c code, but there are my
times when this is ideal:

   * Editing binary executables.

   * Editing your fixed disks (i.e. /dev/xyz)

   * Checking the output of a Program's binary data file.

   * Any place you might use od(1) but need more power.  Compare more
     vs less.
