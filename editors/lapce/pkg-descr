Lapce is written in pure Rust with a UI in Druid. It is designed with
Rope Science from the Xi-Editor which makes for lightning-fast
computation, and leverages OpenGL for rendering.

 - Built-in LSP (Language Server Protocol) support to give you
   intelligent code features such as: completion, diagnostics and code
   actions
 - Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and
   toggleable)
 - Built-in remote development support inspired by VSCode Remote
   Development.
 - Plugins can be written in programming languages that can compile to
   the WASI format (C, Rust, AssemblyScript)
 - Built-in terminal, so you can execute commands in your workspace,
   without leaving Lapce.
