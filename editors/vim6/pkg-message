SECURITY NOTE: The VIM software has had several remote vulnerabilities
discovered within VIM's modeline support.  It allowed remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code as the user running VIM.  All known problems
have been fixed, but the FreeBSD Security Team advises that VIM users
use 'set nomodeline' in ~/.vimrc to avoid the possibility of trojaned
text files.
