A full-featured, super fast implementation of Shaun Lebron's parinfer.

Parinfer is a proof-of-concept editor mode for Lisp programming
languages.  It simplifies the way we write Lisp by auto-adjusting
parens when indentation changes and vice versa.  The hope is to
make basic Lisp-editing easier for newcomers and experts alike,
while still allowing existing plugins like Paredit to satisfy the
need for more advanced operations.

Parinfer-rust comes with plugins for Kakoune, Vim8, and Neovim.
The Rust library can be called from other editors that can load
dynamic libraries.

This plugin implements "smart" mode.  Rather than switching between
"paren" mode and "indent" mode, parinfer uses information about how
the user is changing the file to decide what to do.
