OpenOffice.org Build 1.1.1 Personal Install How-To

Written by:	Martin Blapp <mbr@freebsd.org>

1 User installation
-------------------

Just type "openoffice" after you have successfully
installed the package. If there is no installed
OO.org dir in hour homedir, you'll be prompted to
install some files and choose a installed JDK.
The setup installs a "OpenOffice.org1.1.0" folder
in your homedir.

If the setup tells you there is already an installed
version, you may look at the file ".sversionrc" in
your homedir. In this file OpenOffice and StarOffice
have both a line for each version which is installed.
After removing the problematic line you should be able to
install again.

2 Start OO.org
--------------

There are some wrappers installed for fast startup.
Add "${PREFIX}/bin/" to your PATH and you will be able
to use them.

${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1-sagenda
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1-scalc
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1-sdraw
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1-setup
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1-sfax
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1-simpress
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1-spadmin
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1-sweb
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-1.1-swriter

OO.org does need $LANG to be set to a suitable value.
If it is not already set, a default value is chosen.
Some old X-Servers before XFree86 4.2 do not like the
western locale with Euro symbol (ISO_8859-15).
You should ignore the warning message then or upgrade to
to a more recent X-server.

If you have chosen US-ASCII as locale, you cannot load
and save documents with special characters and these
characters are also not available in swriter and scalc.

3 Setup problems (FreeBSD < 4.7-RELEASE only)
---------------------------------------------

If the setup complains about a missing file "setup.ins",
it's time to upgrade your FreeBSD system to the latest
version. You will encounter this bug only if your OS is
older than FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE.

4 Crashes in URL-location bar (FreeBSD < 4.7-RELEASE only)
----------------------------------------------------------

OO.org can crash if you enter a non existing path
or URL in the location bar. To fix these crashes
you need the following patch. You will see this
bug only if your OS is older than FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE.

5 Crash at startup after using a localized version
--------------------------------------------------

If you had installed the english version, and then have
switched to a localized OO.org, it will crash instantly.

To solve this issue, please remove the already installed
OpenOffice.org1.1Beta dir in your homedir and remove the
appropriate entry from ".sversionrc". After you have done
this, redo the user installation and the problem will
go away.
