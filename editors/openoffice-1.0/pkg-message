OpenOffice.org Build 1.0.1 Personal Install How-To

Written by:	Martin Blapp <mbr@freebsd.org>

OpenOffice.org will soon been installed in
${PREFIX}/OpenOffice.org1.0/

1 User installation
-------------------

1.1 OO.org installed from the ports collection

Once this is done you have to run "make install-user" as the
user you like to use OO.org and choose a standard workstation
installation.

1.2 OO.org installed as package

If you have just installed OO.org as package, there is no
"make install-user" option available. Instead you'll have
to run as the user you like to use OO.org:

"${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-setup" and choose a standard workstation
installation.

2 JDK-Installation
------------------

If OO.org asks you to choose the Java JDK during
"make install-user", you must choose the linux jdk1.3.1.
Native FreeBSD jdk1.3.1 does not work yet with FreeBSD
OO.org does ignore it.

3 Start OO.org
--------------

There are some wrappers installed for fast startup.
Add "${PREFIX}/bin/" to your PATH and you will be able
to use them.

${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-sagenda
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-scalc
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-sdraw
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-setup
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-sfax
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-simpress
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-spadmin
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-sweb
${PREFIX}/bin/openoffice-swriter

4 Setup problems
----------------

If the setup complains about a missing file "setup.ins",
it's time to upgrade your FreeBSD system to the lastest
version. You will encounter this bug only if your OS is
older than FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE. 4.6-RELEASE and
4.6.2-RELEASE are still affected.

5 Crashes in URL-location bar
-----------------------------

OO.org can crash if you enter a non existing path
or URL in the location bar. To fix these crashes
you need a uncommitted system patch for rtld:
