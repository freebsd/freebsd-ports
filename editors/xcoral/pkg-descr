From the docs:

  Xcoral is a multiwindow mouse-based text editor for the X Window System. A
  built-in browser enables you to navigate through C functions, C++ classes,
  methods and files. A SMall Ansi C Interpreter (Smac) is also built-in to
  dynamically extend the editor's possibilities (user functions, key
  bindings, modes etc). Xcoral provides variable width fonts, menus,
  scrollbars, buttons, search, regions, kill-buffers, macros and undo. An
  on-line manual box, with a table of contents and an index, helps you to
  use and customize the editor. Commands are accessible from menus or key
  bindings. Xcoral is a direct Xlib client and runs on color/bw X Display.

The example .xcoralrc is in ${PREFIX}/share/xcoral/xcoralrc.fl; cp it
to ~/.xcoralrc, and fire up xcoral.
