e93 is a portable window based text editor oriented to the needs of
programmers.  It was begun in 1993 (thus the name). It uses the mouse,
selections, cut/copy/paste, and closely follows the model of editors
on the Macintosh and NeXT platforms. 

*  e93 supports columnar selection. It achieves this by allowing multiple pieces
   of the text to be selected simultaneously (this is perhaps its most unique
   feature). 

*  e93 imposes no limits on the line length, file length, or number of
   simultaneous files which it can edit. 

*  e93 is able to handle all 8-bit binary codes without complaint, or confusion.

*  e93 is highly configurable without recompiling because scripts which control
   the editor can be written in Tcl. 

*  e93 supports user-configurable syntax highlighting.
