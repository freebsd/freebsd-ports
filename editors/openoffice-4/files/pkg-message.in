Apache OpenOffice Build %%AOOTAG%% Personal Install How-To

Apache OpenOffice %%AOOTAG%% will soon be installed in
%%PREFIX%%/%%EXECBASE%%

1. Scanner interface
--------------------
To enable the scanner interface, install the sane-backends package.

2. Spell checkers
-----------------
Dictionaries for various languages are available as packages.
They are named LANG-hunspell, where LANG can be "en", "es", "it" etc.
The corresponding ports are in the textproc category.

3. User installation
--------------------
Just type "%%EXECBASE%%" after you have successfully installed
the package.  If there is no installed .openoffice.org directory in your
home directory, the setup installs the "%%AOOUDIR%%" folder.

4. Starting Apache OpenOffice
-----------------------------
There are some wrappers installed for faster startup.  Add "%%PREFIX%%/bin/"
to your PATH and you will be able to use them.

%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-printeradmin
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sbase
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-scalc
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-sdraw
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-simpress
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-smath
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%EXECBASE%%-swriter

OpenOffice does need $LANG to be set to a suitable value.

5. Wiki Publisher Extension
---------------------------
The Wiki Publisher extension is now an integrated extension and manual
installation with the extension manager is no longer needed.

6. If you run into problems
---------------------------
If you somehow run into problems, please remove the already installed
"%%AOOUDIR%%" directory in your home directory, then redo the
user installation and the problems should go away.
