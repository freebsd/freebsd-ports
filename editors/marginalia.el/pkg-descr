This package provides marginalia-mode which adds marginalia to the
minibuffer completions. Marginalia are marks or annotations placed at
the margin of the page of a book or in this case helpful colorful
annotations placed at the margin of the minibuffer for your completion
candidates. Marginalia can only add annotations to the completion
candidates. It cannot modify the appearance of the candidates
themselves, which are shown unaltered as supplied by the original
command.

The annotations are added based on the completion category. For
example find-file reports the file category and M-x reports the
command category. You can cycle between more or less detailed
annotators or even disable the annotator with command
marginalia-cycle.
