Jupp is the portable version of Joe's Own Editor.  This version has been
enhanced by several functions intended for programmers or other professional
users, and has a lot of bugs fixed.  It is based upon an older version of
joe because these behave better overall.

Jupp also does come with the editor flavours known from joe, specifically,
jmacs, joe, jpico, jstar, and rjoe.  Not all features of jupp are available
for these though (but all the bugfixes, and syntax highlighting is still
enabled by default for these, while it is not auto-enabled in jupp).
