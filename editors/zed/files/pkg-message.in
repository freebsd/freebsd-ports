Remote development over ssh:

If you want to use remote development over ssh and a remote host runs
FreeBSD, take the following steps:

1. Create a directory for storing the remote server
   $ ssh <remote-host> mkdir ~/.zed_server
2. Upload the remote server to the remote host
   $ scp %%PREFIX%%/bin/zed-remote-server-stable-%%DISTVERSION%%+stable <remote-host>:~/.zed_server

Now you are all set for remote development.

If your remote host runs Linux or macOS, remote development should
work out of the box.

General information on remote development is available at the
following URL:
- https://zed.dev/docs/remote-development

Limitations on FreeBSD:

Realtime collaboration features based on WebRTC are not yet
supported. In addition, integrated terminal is very laggy (might
depending on a user's environment).
