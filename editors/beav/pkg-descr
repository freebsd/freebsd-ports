BEAV (Binary Editor And Viewer), is a full featured binary file 
editor.	  Just about any operation that you could want to do to a binary 
file is possible with BEAV.   You can insert or delete in the middle of 
a file thereby changing it's size.   You can edit multiple files in 
multiple windows and cut and paste between them.   You can display and 
edit data in hex, octal, decimal, binary, ascii, or ebcdic formats.   You 
can display data in byte, word, or long word formats in either Intel or 
Motorola byte ordering.   You can send the formatted display mode to a 
file or printer.
