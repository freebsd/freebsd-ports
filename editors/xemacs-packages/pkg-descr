Starting with release 21, xemacs does not come with lisp packages
any more. Instead, they are distributed separately from the main
sources.

    This port provides a set of the xemacs-packages category packages provided
by xemacs.org(www.xemacs.org).

To install other categories' packages, use editors/xemacs-*-packages
ports/packages.
