  message: <<EOM
Emacs is now built with native compilation enabled by default, which
requires GCC version 11 or later.  However, it is known that some
elisp applications don't work correctly when compiled.  You can work
around any such issues by disabling native compilation using the
following steps.

1. Add the following lines at the top of your Emacs configuration:

(setq native-comp-deferred-compilation nil
comp-enable-subr-trampolines nil)

2. Exit emacs

3. rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/eln-cache

4. Start emacs again

Whereas all elisp files included in the Emacs source archive are
native compiled at build time, 3rd party elisp files (for example,
from elisp ports/packages) are native compiled at run time. This will
result in high CPU usage when they are compiled. If this annoys you,
you can throttle the number of jobs by changing the value of the
variable 'native-comp-async-jobs-number' in your emacs
configuration. See the output of `C-h v native-comp-async-jobs-number`
for details.
