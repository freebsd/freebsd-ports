Vim is a virtually compatible, extreamly enhanced, version of the UNIX
text editor vi.

There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi-windows
and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing, filename completion,
on-line help, visual selection, etc..  

Many features above standard vi's have been added:
    multiple windows and buffers, multi level undo, command line history,
    filename completion, selection highlighting, block operations (including
    column/rectangular blocks), syntax highlighting, on-line help, etc.
	Embeded Perl, Tcl, and Python support.
	See ":help vi_diff" for a summary of the differences between Vim and Vi.

	An X-windows aware or a full X-windows GUI version can also be built
	that allows full use of the mouse and pull-down menus

See http://www.vim.org/why.html for a full explanation of Vim's features.

Portability to all UNIX platforms, AmigaOS, Archimedes, Atari MiNT, BeOS,
M$-DOS, MacOS, OS/2, VMS, WinNT+Win95.
