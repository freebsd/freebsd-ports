Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing.
It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.

Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that
many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is
perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing
configuration files.

Despite what the above comic suggests, Vim can be configured to work in a very
simple (Notepad-like) way, called evim or Easy Vim.
