Heme is intended to be fast and portable console hex editor for Unix-like
systems.  It has undo support (number of undo operations is only limited by
available memory), ability to fill a range of addresses with the specified
byte, ability to search for a single byte or character string.  Offsets can
be given in hexadecimal, octal, or decimal forms.  There are two editing
modes: hex (binary) and ASCII (text).

Heme uses standard curses library for screen and input handling, and offers
colors support (they can be set in the configuration file).
