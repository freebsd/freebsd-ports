To use the sly-named-readtables contrib, you must:
1. Register sly-named-readtables into SLY.  You just have to add this line to
   some init file:
(require 'sly-named-readtables)
   Doing this is not strictly necessary if you want to automatically activate
   this contrib using `sly-contribs' (see below), but it never hurts.
   This contrib's automatic activation at load was disabled, contrary to what
   upstream does.  Upstream's autoloads file is consequently not necessary, and
   not included in this package.
2. Ensure that system NAMED-READTABLES is loaded by your Common Lisp
   implementation.

If you want sly-named-readtables to be automatically activated on each new SLY
session, put it in the `sly-contribs' list.  E.g., you can add something like
this in some Emacs' init file:
(setq sly-contribs '(sly-fancy sly-named-readtables))
or customize the variable.

To enable it on demand in already running SLY sessions instead, just use the
`sly-enable-contrib' command, or modify `sly-contribs' and run `sly-setup'.
