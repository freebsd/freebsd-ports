This package provides an orderless completion style that divides the
pattern into space-separated components, and matches candidates that
match all of the components in any order. Each component can match in
any one of several ways: literally, as a regexp, as an initialism, in
the flex style, or as multiple word prefixes. By default, regexp and
literal matches are enabled.
