Remote development over ssh:

If you want to use remote development over ssh, download and install
Open Remote - SSH extension[1].

It is a slightly modified version of the extension of the same name
available at the Open VSX Registry[2]. The contents of the
modification is available at the GitHub Pull Request[3].

After installation of the extension, restart code-oss and it should
work out of the box. Please note that the remote extension host will
be downloaded from the following URL[4] to the remote host upon first
connection from the local host.

Supported combination of local and remote hosts is as follows:

Local           Remote
-------------   -------------
FreeBSD amd64   FreeBSD amd64
                Linux x86_64
                Linux arm64

The remote extension host is actually a Node.js-based server and make
it sure that you have dependency packages installed when the remote
host is FreeBSD.

You can check which packages are necessary on the remote host at
FreshPorts[5]. (Install library and runtime dependencies) In addition,
you have to install misc/compat13x package if the remote host is
FreeBSD 14 or later. The remote extension host has been built on
FreeBSD 13 for compatibility reasons.
