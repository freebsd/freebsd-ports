HT is a file editor/viewer/analyzer for executables. The goal is to combine
the low-level functionality of a debugger and the usability of IDEs. We aim
towards a perfect hex-editing ability and support of the most important file
formats.

Support means that HT will be able to correctly display and modify the
executable header, image and other extensions specific to the file (import/
export sections, relocations, debugging information etc.). Support will
probably include the following file formats: 

   - Win32 portable executables (PE) (good support) 
   - Unix executable and linkable format (ELF) (good support) 
   - DOS standard executables (MZ) (supported) 
   - Win32 linear executables (LE) (supported) 
   - Windows/OS2 "new" executables (NE) (supported) 
   - Unix common object file format (COFF) + DJGPP COFF (supported) 
   - OS2 linear executables (LX) 
   - M$ object files (.obj)
