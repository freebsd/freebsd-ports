Thot offers the usual functionality of a word processor, but it also
processes the document structure. It includes a large set of advanced
tools, such as a spell checker and an index generator, and it allows to
export documents to common formats like HTML and LaTeX.
This release should be considered as a snapshot of a work in progress. A
large part of the intended features of Thot Editor are implemented, but
some of them are not complete yet and the software is not supposed to be very
robust. The user interface may change and can be improved.
