Tetradraw is a fully featured ANSI art editor for Unix operating systems.
ANSI art is only made up of the ASCII characters with 16 colours. ANSI art is
mainly used in text mode interfaces. Tetradraw is the first completly usable
ANSI art editor for Unix operating systems. Tetradraw does not just emulate
the ANSI editors for DOS: it also allows two artists to edit the same image
simultaneously over the Internet.
