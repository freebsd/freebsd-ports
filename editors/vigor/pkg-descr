In a recent fit of madness, hacker Joel Holveck has released Vigor, a version
of the popular Unix editor vi featuring the Vigor Assistant. Holveck declined
to comment on his true motives for creating the program, although it has been
confirmed that he was inspired by Pitr of User Friendly the Comic Strip.

Holveck denies rumors that he created the program as part of a plot to
encourage the use of Emacs.
