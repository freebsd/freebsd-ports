FXiTe is an advanced cross-platform text editor built with the Fox GUI
toolkit and the FXScintilla text widget. It features built-in syntax
highlighting for 40+ languages, an embedded Lua scripting engine, macro
recording and playback, multi-line regular expression search and
replace, rudimentary ctags and calltip support, a flexible interface to
external tools, and a built-in "message window" to capture the output of
external commands such as compiler error messages, etc.
