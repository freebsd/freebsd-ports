The Lazarus RAD was installed

1) You can run it using:

   # lazarus

2) The first time that lazarus is running, you should set the path to fpc 
   source directory at lazarus configuration environment. Also it could be 
   setting later.

3) You can obtain freepascal source code from:

   %%PORTSDIR%%/distfiles/freepascal

   It could be extracted to your home directory.

4) You can use %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/gdb debugger instead of gdb installed debugger
   installed from base system. Lazarus works better with this version.

5) The lazbuild.cfg file has been removed, it is not necessary anymore. Now 
   we can use the following ports for aplications that depend of lazarus 
   and these can be built with an interface different than lazarus has compiled 
   by default:

   editors/lazarus-lcl-nogui
   editors/lazarus-lcl-gtk2
   editors/lazarus-lcl-qt

   You can added those ports if you want support for nogui, gtk2 or qt 
   interfaces. Please look at net-p2p/transmission-remote-gui like a example of
   how use it

6) Enjoy it ;)
