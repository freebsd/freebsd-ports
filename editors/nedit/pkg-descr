NEdit is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) style text editor for
programs and plain-text files.  Users of Macintosh and MS Windows
based text editors will find NEdit a familiar and comfortable
environment.  NEdit provides all of the standard menu, dialog,
editing, and mouse support, as well as all of the standard shortcuts
to which the users of modern GUI based environments are accustomed.
For users of older style Unix editors, welcome to the world of
mouse-based editing!

This port requires Motif to build, however it works reasonably well
with the free Motif clone LessTif.
