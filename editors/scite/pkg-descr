SciTE is a SCIntilla based Text Editor. Originally built to demonstrate
Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities for
building and running programs. It is best used for jobs with simple
configurations - I use it for building test and demonstration programs as well
as SciTE and Scintilla, themselves.
