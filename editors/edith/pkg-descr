Edith Pro is a high quality user-friendly text editing system
that combines a modern, colourful multi-window user interface
with large basic editing flexibility. It is intended for those
who want a powerful editing tool, but are not prepared to
spend a wealth of energy into learning and configuring their
applications.

Edith Pro concentrates on editing features that are universal
in applicability; as such it is not a programmable editor, but
it has many well thought-out elementary features that allow
efficient text editing for arbitrary types of text.

This port uses the Linux binary compatibility.
