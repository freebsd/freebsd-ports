This is a package containing only the executables for XEmacs with
Mule(version %%XEMACS_VER%%), the next generation of Emacs.

You need to install a package, xemacs-common-%%XEMACS_VER%%, containing emacs
lisp files, info pages, and so on (except executables) for
XEmacs with Mule(version %%XEMACS_VER%%).

This package is not built with any particular language support except for
already built-in Imput Method - SKK and SJ3.  If you want other built-in
input method, look into the xemacs ports in language- specific directories.
Currently only Japanese (Canna, FreeWnn and Wnn6) is available.

This package and the package, xemacs-common-%%XEMACS_VER%% are designed
*not* to clobber any existing emacs installation.  In particular, the
executables and man pages of etags/ctags are not installed, and the
info pages that come with the original emacs don't get installed too.
The Japanese version is build to install everything, by the way.
