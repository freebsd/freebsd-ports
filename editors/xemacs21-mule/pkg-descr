This is a package containing only the executables for stable
version of XEmacs with Mule, the next generation of Emacs.

This package is not built with any particular language support except for
already built-in Imput Method - SKK and SJ3.  If you want other built-in
input method, look into the xemacs ports in language- specific directories.
Currently only Japanese (Canna, FreeWnn and Wnn6) is available.

This package is designed *not* to clobber any existing emacs installation.
In particular, the executables and man pages of etags/ctags are not
installed, and the info pages that come with the original emacs don't get
installed too. The Japanese version is build to install everything, by the
way.
