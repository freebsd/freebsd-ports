Gobby is a free collaborative editor. This means that it provides you with the
possibility to edit files simultaneously with other users over a network.
The platforms on which you could use Gobby are so far Microsoft Windows, Linux,
Mac OS X and other Unix-like ones. Developed with the GTK+ toolkit it
integrates nicely into the GNOME desktop environment if you want it to.
