TECO is the grand old text editor.  It is powerful and compact precursor
to EMACS and has a completely nongraphical user interface.  It is very fast
(probably the fastes editor in the world) and have a macro language.  TECO
was written by Dan Murphy (http://www.opost.com/dlm) at Digital Equipment
Corporation in 1962.  This is based on Pete Siemsen's TECOC implementation,
and comes with a copy of the originals DECUS TECO documentation.
