	TECO is the grand old text editor. It is powerful and compact
precursor to EMACS and has a completely nongraphical user interface.
It is very fast (probably the fastes editor in the world) and have a
macro language. TECO was written by Dan Murphy (http://www.opost.com/dlm)
at Digital Equipment Corporation in 1962. This is based on Pete Siemsen's
TECOC implementation, and comes with a copy of the originals DECUS TECO
documentation.
