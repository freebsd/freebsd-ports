Powerful and compact editor with nongraphical user interface

The FreeBSD port implements pretty well all that the Linux version does.

There is now a manual page; note carefully that the name of the
executable file is 'tecoc', and that it takes a first argument
specifying how it is to run. The manual page has many more details.

Most users will want to set up aliases for using the program; this is
not done by the port to avoid unnecessary namespace pollution. There is
also the issue that the conventional command for creating a new file
with teco is 'make' - it is suggested that a capitalised version,
'Make', is used instead. However, users can choose any name they like.

An example set of aliases for csh might be:

        alias Make 'tecoc make'
        alias teco 'tecoc teco'
        alias mung 'tecoc mung'
        alias inspect 'tecoc teco -inspect'

For bash, they might be:

        alias Make='tecoc make'
        alias teco='tecoc teco'
        alias mung='tecoc mung'
        alias inspect='tecoc teco -inspect'


If the port is built with the DOCS option set to ON, then documentation
will be installed into %%DOCSDIR%%. This will include
a large teco manual named 'teco.doc', and a quick reference 'wall chart'
named 'wchart.txt'. Other documents located there are outdated and/or
inconsistent, and thus of limited use.

Before starting to use tecoc, see the sections "DESCRIPTION/Command
names" and "SEE ALSO" in the manual page.
