This package contains emacs lisp files, info pages, and so on (except
executables) for mule-2.3, a multilingual editor based on emacs-19.34.

You must install one of packages, mule-2.3, ja-mule-*-2.3 
(ja-mule-canna-2.3, ja-mule-canna+sj3-2.3, etc.), zh-mule-freewnn-2.3
and ko-mule-freewnn-2.3, each of which contains only the executables
for mule-2.3.

This package and the above package of the executables *will* clobber
any existing emacs installation.  In particular, the executables and
man pages of etags/ctags are installed, and the info pages that come
with the original emacs get installed too.

Although this shouldn't cause any problems to run both mule and emacs,
it may cause some confusion when one of them is pkg_delete'd.  If
someone has a solution to this, please tell me.

A "dir" file is supplied in the ${PORTSDIR}/editors/mule-common/files/
subdirectory of the ports package.  Copy it into your /usr/local/info
to read mule info pages, but also make sure you also add everything
that may have been added to that file!
