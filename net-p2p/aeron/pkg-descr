Efficient reliable UDP unicast, UDP multicast, and IPC message transport.
Java, C, C++, .NET clients are available.
All clients can exchange messages across machines, or on the same machine
via IPC, very efficiently. Message streams can be recorded by the Archive module
to persistent storage for later, or real-time, replay. Aeron Cluster provides
support for fault-tolerant services as replicated state machines based on the
Raft consensus algorithm.
