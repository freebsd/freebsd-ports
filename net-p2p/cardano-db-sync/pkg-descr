The purpose of Cardano DB Sync is to follow the Cardano chain and take
information from the chain and an internally maintained copy of ledger state.
Data is then extracted from the chain and inserted into a PostgreSQL database.
Queries can then be written directly against the database schema or as queries
embedded in any language with libraries for interacting with an SQL database.
This package provides a daemon program to run the Cardano DB Sync and a CLI
DB management tool.
