KTorrent has been split into the application ktorrent and the library
libktorrent. Libktorrent contains all the torrent downloading code,
and ktorrent contains all application code and plugins. The goal
is to make libktorrent an independent library (though still closely
related to ktorrent), which can be used by other applications.
