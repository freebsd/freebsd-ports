Oura is a rust-native implementation of a pipeline that connects to the
tip of a Cardano node through a combination of Ouroboros mini-protocol
(using either a unix socket or tcp bearer), filters the events that match
a particular pattern and then submits a succint, self-contained payload
to pluggable observers called "sinks".
