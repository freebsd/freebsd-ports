Stig features:

* Filters are used to select torrents for listing, starting/stopping, deleting,
etc

* Tabs allow you to open and switch between multiple lists (torrents, peers,
files, etc)

* Commands do almost everything, and they can be invoked:
- through single- or multi-key (think GNU/EMACS) keybindings,
- by entering them in a command prompt in the TUI (think vi) with tab completion
- by providing them as CLI arguments when invoking stig (think Git),
- or by listing them in an rc file which is automatically loaded.

* Color themes support 16 and 256 colors

* Complete built-in documentation with help command or --help argument

* Full API abstraction layer makes it possible to add support for other
BitTorrent clients with RPC interfaces (contributors are welcome)
