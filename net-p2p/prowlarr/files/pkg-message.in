  message: <<EOM

This package installs a service file.
Enable it with "sysrc %%PORTNAME%%_enable=TRUE"
Start it with "service %%PORTNAME%% start".

If you are running this in a jail please set "allow_mlock=1" or similar
for this jail otherwise the program will fail to start

Finally, the built-in updater is disabled.
If you like to use the updater, remove the file %%DATADIR%%/package_info,
chown the directory %%DATADIR%%/bin to %%USERS%% and restart %%PORTNAME%%
The built-in updater can now be configured in the Settings tab of %%PORTNAME%%

NOTE: While the built-in updater will update %%PORTNAME%% it has side-effects:
it breaks the ability of pkg to check for corruption in %%PORTNAME%% files
it breaks the ability of pkg to determine if it has removed files correctly
during "pkg remove %%PORTNAME%%" and also
it breaks the fundamental understanding that updates should be handled only
by the system that put the files there in the first place.
