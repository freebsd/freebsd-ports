Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform built by a decentralized
community of scientists, engineers, and thought leaders. Cardano is based on
Ouroboros, an environmentally sustainable, verifiably secure consensus protocol
with rigorous security guarantees.

This package provides a daemon program to run the Cardano node.
