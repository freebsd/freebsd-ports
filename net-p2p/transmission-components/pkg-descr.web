Transmission Web Interface (Clutch) is a WebUI for the Transmission BitTorrent
client. It allows you to manage your torrents from anywhere you can access the
internet, and runs on OS X and various flavors of *nix. It provides most of
the basic features of the desktop client, including torrent upload, torrent
start/stop, file path selection, speed limiting etc.

Use of the Transmission Web Interface requires installation of 
transmission-daemon, transmisssion-gtk, or transmission-qt.
