Deluge is a Bittorrent client written in Python and GTK+. Deluge is intended
to bring a native, full-featured client to Linux, BSD, and other *nix GTK
desktop environments such as Gnome and Xfce.

Deluge uses Rasterbar's version of libtorrent as the main ingredient in its
bittorrent protocol backend.
