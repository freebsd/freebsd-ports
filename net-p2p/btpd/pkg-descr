BTPD is a bittorrent client consisting of a daemon and client commands, which
can be used to read and/or manipulate the daemon state. The daemon is capable of
running several torrents simultaneously and only uses one tcp port. It's fairly
low on resource usage and should be perfect for file distribution sites.
Efficient downloads and ease of use makes this client a good choice for the
casual user as well.
