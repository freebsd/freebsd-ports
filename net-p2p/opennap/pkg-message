*************************************************

A default administrator user has been created.
The user name is 'admin', password 'opennap'.
You will probably want to change these.
To do so, edit the file
${PREFIX}/share/opennap/users .

Example configuration files are located in
${PREFIX}/share/opennap/examples/ .  Copy
them to ${PREFIX}/share/opennap, removing the
'sample.' prefix (e.g. 'sample.conf' becomes
'conf') and edit to your preferences.

Documentation is installed under
${PREFIX}/share/doc/opennap .

If you would like to link your server to the
global Napigator search system, go to
http://www.napigator.com/ and follow the
directions under "CAN I RUN MY OWN NAP SERVER?"

Have fun!
