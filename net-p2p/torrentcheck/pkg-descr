This program is a command-line utility to catalog and verify torrent files.
Run with only the -t option, it displays the metadata, name, and size of
each file in the torrent.  Run with the -t and -p options, it computes the
hashes of all files in the torrent, compares them against the hashes stored
in the metadata, and warns of any errors.

Torrentcheck also verifies the length of each file, and flags an error if
the length is wrong even if the hash codes match.  It is designed to handle
files over 4GB on a 32-bit machine.

If torrentcheck returns "torrent is good" at the end of its output, every
byte of every file in the torrent is present and correct, to a high degree
of certainty (as explained in the README file).
