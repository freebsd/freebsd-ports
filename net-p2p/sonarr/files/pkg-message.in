  message: <<EOM

%%PORTNAME%% relies on Microsoft dotNET5+ SDK to be built
Microsoft does not have an official version of dotNET for FreeBSD

This package was built with an UNOFFICIAL UNSUPPORTED version of dotNET
If this is something that you do not want, remove this package with
"pkg remove %%PORTNAME%%"

This package installs a service file.
Enable it with "sysrc %%PORTNAME%%_enable=TRUE"
Start it with "service %%PORTNAME%% start".

If you are running this in a jail please set "allow_mlock=1" or similar
for this jail otherwise the program will fail to start

Finally, the built-in updater is disabled.
If you like to use the updater, remove the file %%DATADIR%%/package_info,
chown the directory %%DATADIR%%/bin to %%USERS%% and restart %%PORTNAME%%
The built-in updater can now be configured in the Settings tab of %%PORTNAME%%

NOTE: While the built-in updater will update %%PORTNAME%% it has side-effects:
it breaks the ability of pkg to check for corruption in %%PORTNAME%% files
it breaks the ability of pkg to determine if it has removed files correctly
during "pkg remove %%PORTNAME%%" and also
it breaks the fundamental understanding that updates should be handled only
by the system that put the files there in the first place.
