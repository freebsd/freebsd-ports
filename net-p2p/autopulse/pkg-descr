An automated scanning tool that bridges media organizers
such as Sonarr and Radarr with media servers
such as Plex and Jellyfin.

The goal is to provide a simple, efficient, and reliable way to update
your media library reducing full library scans.

A key feature is the ability to provide a hash of the file to the API,
which will then wait for the file to match that hash before updating targets.

Another benefit over autoscan is support for PostgreSQL as backend.
