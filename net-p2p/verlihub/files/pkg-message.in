Scripts and the executable have been installed in %%PREFIX%%/bin/.

This port requires a working MySQL server installation, either
locally or remotely.

Visit http://www.verlihub-project.org/ for the project's homepage,
manual, forums, scripts and etc.

INSTALLATION

Once you have a properly-running MySQL server, please run install
script:

	%%PREFIX%%/bin/vh_install

and follow the instructions given.

UPGRADE

If you upgrade from version prior to 0.9.8e please note the
following:

    - Database charset is now set explicitly to UTF8 - verlihub
      will alter all tables during the first run. So if you have
      used custom charset you should deal with it (backup, i.e.)
      before the first run!
    - You need to rerun vh_install as during the first installation
