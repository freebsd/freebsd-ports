Little GTK+ enabled Perl companion to eDonkey and the ed2k GTK+ GUI
to ease the process of adding files to the download queue using
ed2k:// links. It was designed for better ed2k:// URL handling
within Gnome (especially Galeon) but might be used for any other
purpose. It is quite too few code to take care on drafting out a
license, so regard it as GPLed software.
