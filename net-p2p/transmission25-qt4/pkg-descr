A fast and lightweight QT4 BitTorrent client, loosely based on the GTK+ client.

This is the only Transmission client that can act as its own self-contained
session (as the GTK+ and Mac clients do), and can also connect to a remote
session (as the web client and transmission-remote terminal client do).

Transmission has been built from the ground up to be a lightweight, yet
powerful BitTorrent client. Its simple, intuitive interface is designed
to integrate tightly with whatever computing environment you choose to
use. Transmission strikes a balance between providing useful functionality
without feature bloat. Furthermore, it is free for anyone to use or modify.
