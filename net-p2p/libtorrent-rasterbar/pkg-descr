libtorrent is a C++ library that aims to be a good alternative to all the
other bittorrent implementations around. It is a library and not a full
featured client, although it comes with a working example client.

The main goals of libtorrent are to be cpu efficient, memory efficient and
very easy to use.

Note that this is NOT the same library as the libtorrent port!
