Frost is a Freenet client that provides newsgroup-like messaging, private
encrypted messages, file upload and download functionality and a file sharing
system.

If this is your first time trying Frost, you'll see its quite different from
other filesharing programs. Its anonymous, and yet has a very personal
atmosphere.

If you know how to use newsgroups, you'll find Frost very easy to use and will
feel right at home. If you're used to other filesharing apps, you should know
that the best way to find what you're looking for is to ask for it. If you
can't find it in the search results, post a message to the relevant board and
someone will respond to you. Common questions are answered in the Support area.
