Intel HEXL is an open-source library which provides efficient implementations of
integer arithmetic on Galois fields. Such arithmetic is prevalent in
cryptography, particularly in homomorphic encryption (HE) schemes. Intel HEXL
targets integer arithmetic with word-sized primes, typically 30-60 bits. Intel
HEXL provides an API for 64-bit unsigned integers and targets Intel CPUs.
