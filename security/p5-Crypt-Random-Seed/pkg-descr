Crypt::Random::Seed is a simple mechanism to get strong randomness. The main
purpose of this module is to provide a simple way to generate a seed for a PRNG
such as Math::Random::ISAAC, for use in cryptographic key generation, or as the
seed for an upstream module such as Bytes::Random::Secure. Flags for requiring
non-blocking sources are allowed, as well as a very simple method for plugging
in a source.
