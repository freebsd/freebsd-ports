Pam_helper is a small utility which allows non-PAM, or non-setuid
applications to make use of PAM's authentication services.  It was mainly
created to allow gnome-screensaver to make use of PAM, but any application
could use it.  It accepts two arguments, the PAM service name, and a
username.  It reads the user's password from stdin.
