n2n is a layer-two peer-to-peer virtual private network (VPN) which allows 
users to exploit features typical of P2P applications at network instead of 
application level. This means that users can gain native IP visibility 
(e.g. two PCs belonging to the same n2n network can ping each other) and be 
reachable with the same network IP address regardless of the network where 
they currently belong. In a nutshell, as OpenVPN moved SSL from application 
(e.g. used to implement the https protocol) to network protocol, n2n moves 
P2P from application to network level.
