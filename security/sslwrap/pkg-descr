   This is a port of sslwrap.

   "... sslwrap is a simple Unix service that sits over any simple TCP service
   such as POP3, IMAP, SMTP, and encrypts all of the data on the
   connection using TLS/SSL. It uses ssleay to support SSL version 2 and
   3. It can run out of inetd. It can also encrypt data for services
   located on another computer.

   It works with the servers you already have, and does not require any
   modifications to your existing servers. ..."

   Of course, it works with OpenSSL, too.
