=================================================================
- Universal server building block (OpenXPKI) for arbitrary PKI: installed.
- SCEP prerequisite binary and i18n tools for UI: installed.
- Enable utf8 locale (e.g. en_US.utf8) for the translation staff to operate
  (translation is needed even for English language).
- Install your favorite database (enable utf8 support),
  e.g. databases/mysql56-server
- Install perl interface for your favorite database,
  e.g. databases/p5-DBD-mysql
- Install your favorite web server.
  Choose from two versions of the handler: based on CGI or FastCGI
  perl core modules.
  Copy CGI or FastCGI scripts from %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/cgi-bin to the location
  where your web server can use them. Set executable permissions for them.
  Copy htdocs files from %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/htdocs to the location
  where your web server can use them.
  You can see some samples in %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/config/apache.
- If you want your server to act just as the simplest CA,
  then the basic deployment procedure is all you need:
  copy sample configuration for this case with
    cp -R %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/config/openxpki/* %%PREFIX%%/etc/openxpki/
  and follow advice at:
  https://openxpki.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html
  Without this deployment procedure OpenXPKI server would not start.
- If you want more complex role for your server inside the PKI infrastructure,
  then you need to perform further deployment procedure for your server atop
  the basic deployment.
- This port has created user:group as openxpki:openxpki, which owns
  the OpenXPKI server.
- After first fresh installation, create empty log files as follows
  (assuming your web server is owned by user www):

install -m 660 -o openxpki -g openxpki /dev/null /var/log/openxpki/openxpki.log
install -m 660 -o www -g www /dev/null /var/log/openxpki/webui.log
install -m 660 -o www -g www /dev/null /var/log/openxpki/scep.log
install -m 660 -o www -g www /dev/null /var/log/openxpki/soap.log

- It is essential that www and openpki are two different users in your system.

- Start daemons in this order:
    database server,
    OpenXPKI server (%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/openxpki start),
    web server.
- Docs installed (if you opted so) into %%DOCSDIR%%
- Mind FreeBSD specific file structure:
    %%PREFIX%%/etc/openxpki: server configuration, logs configuration.
    /var/openxpki: pid file, socket file, ...
    /var/openxpki/session: session files.
    /var/log/openxpki: server log files.
    /var/tmp: temporary directory.
