pykeepass_cache is a support library for pykeepass. It is a drop-in
replacement for pykeepass.PyKeePass which caches databases in a
background process to make database access faster.

This is useful in situations where the program is terminated between
invocations (e.g. CLI scripts). The background process will
automatically shut down after 300 seconds.
