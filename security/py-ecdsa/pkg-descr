This is an easy-to-use implementation of ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) with
support for ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) and ECDH
(Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman), implemented purely in Python, released under
the MIT license. With this library, you can quickly create key pairs (signing
key and verifying key), sign messages, and verify the signatures. You can also
agree on a shared secret key based on exchanged public keys. The keys and
signatures are very short, making them easy to handle and incorporate into other
protocols.

This library provides key generation, signing, verifying, and shared secret
derivation for five popular NIST "Suite B" GF(p) (prime field) curves, with key
lengths of 192, 224, 256, 384, and 521 bits. The "short names" for these curves,
as known by the OpenSSL tool (openssl ecparam -list_curves), are: prime192v1,
secp224r1, prime256v1, secp384r1, and secp521r1. It includes the 256-bit curve
secp256k1 used by Bitcoin. There is also support for the regular (non-twisted)
variants of Brainpool curves from 160 to 512 bits. The "short names" of those
curves are: brainpoolP160r1, brainpoolP192r1, brainpoolP224r1, brainpoolP256r1,
brainpoolP320r1, brainpoolP384r1, brainpoolP512r1. Few of the small curves from
SEC standard are also included (mainly to speed-up testing of the library),
those are: secp112r1, secp112r2, secp128r1, and secp160r1. No other curves are
included, but it is not too hard to add support for more curves over prime
fields.
