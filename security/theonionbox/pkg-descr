The Onion Box provides a web interface to monitor the operation of a Tor node.
It is able to monitor any Tor node operated as relay, as bridge and even as
client - as long as it can establish a connection to the node and authenticate
successfully.

The connection to the Tor node to be monitored may be established via a local
ControlSocket or a ControlPort (local or remote). Advanced users may establish
a connection via the Tor network to a node proving access to it's ControlPort by
means of a Hidden Service - supporting on demand as well Hidden Service Client
Authorization.

The Onion Box supports whatever authentication method the Tor node provides.

A single instance of The Onion Box is able to provide monitoring functionality
for as many nodes as you like.

Above that, The Onion Box is able to display Tor network status protocol data
for any Tor node known by Onionoo.
