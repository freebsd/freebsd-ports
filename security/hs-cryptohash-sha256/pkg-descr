A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the SHA-256 hash algorithm
(including HMAC support) with performance close to the fastest implementations
available in other languages.

The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that hides the C
implementation.

NOTE: This package has been forked off cryptohash-0.11.7 because the cryptohash
package has been deprecated and so this package continues to satisfy the need for
a lightweight package providing the SHA256 hash algorithm without any dependencies
on packages other than base and bytestring.

Consequently, this package can be used as a drop-in replacement for cryptohash's
Crypto.Hash.SHA256 module, though with a clearly smaller footprint.
