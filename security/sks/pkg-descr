SKS OpenPGP Key Server

SKS is a new OpenPGP keyserver whose goal is to provide easy to deploy,
decentralized, and highly reliable synchronization. That means that a
key submitted to one SKS server will quickly be distributed to all key
servers; and even wildly out-of-date servers, or servers that experience
spotty connectivity, can fully synchronize with rest of the system.

public PGP databse (about 2Gb) and on customising the local configuration
