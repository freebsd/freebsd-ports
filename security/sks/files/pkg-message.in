=> When updating from a previous sks version be aware that the PGP key
=> database files are not compatible. You should run db_recover-5.
=> See %%DOCSDIR%%/UPGRADING for details.

If you are upgrading to version 1.1.6, and your sksconf file does NOT
already contain 'pagesize' and 'ptree_pagesize' variables, then you may need
to add the following two lines to your sksconf file before starting sks:

pagesize:       4
ptree_pagesize: 1

This is due to the default values for these variables changing in v1.1.6

When installing for the first time, you will need to obtain a PGP
key database dump from somewhere and build database files from this.
See %%DOCSDIR%%/README.md for details.
