Cisco-torch is a mass Cisco Vulnerability Scanner.

The main feature that makes Cisco-torch different from similar 
tools is the extensive use of forking to launch multiple scanning 
processes on the background for maximum scanning efficiency. Also, 
it uses several methods of application layer fingerprinting simultaneously, 
if needed. We wanted something fast to discover remote Cisco hosts running 
Telnet, SSH, Web, NTP and SNMP services and launch dictionary attacks 
against the services discovered.
