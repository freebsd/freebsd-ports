FFI bindings for the rustls TLS library.
Rustls is a TLS library that aims to provide a good level of cryptographic
security, requires no configuration to achieve that security, and provides
no unsafe features or obsolete cryptography by default.

Rustls implements TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 for both clients and servers.
