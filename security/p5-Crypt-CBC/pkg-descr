This is Crypt::CBC, a Perl-only implementation of the cryptographic
cipher block chaining mode (CBC).  In combination with a block
cipher such as Crypt::DES or Crypt::IDEA, you can encrypt and
decrypt messages of arbitrarily long length.  The encrypted messages
are compatible with the encryption format used by B<SSLeay>.
