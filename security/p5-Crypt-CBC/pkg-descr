This is Crypt::CBC, a Perl-only implementation of the cryptographic
cipher block chaining mode (CBC). In combination with a block cipher
such as DES or IDEA, you can encrypt and decrypt messages of
arbitrarily long length. The encrypted messages are compatible with
the encryption format used by the OpenSSL package.
