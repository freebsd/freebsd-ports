NCrypt is intended to give you security in an insecure environment. If you are
wanting to encrypt files (particularly on a multi-user system where you don't
have root), wishing to hide your activites from prying eyes, and want to "cover
your tracks", then NCrypt is for you. It is a symmetrical file
encryptor/decryptor that gives you the choice of the top three candidates for
AES as the encryption algorithm (Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish), tries to minimize
exposure of the plaintext password in memory, and can safely erase the plaintext
version from the hard drive. It compiles without any extra crypto libraries,
making it ideal for systems where you just have a compiler and basic libraries
(such as an ISP's shell server).
