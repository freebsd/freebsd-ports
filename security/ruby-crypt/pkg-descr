The Crypt library is a pure-ruby implementation of a number of 
popular encryption algorithms. Block cyphers currently available 
include Blowfish, GOST, IDEA, and Rijndael (AES). 
Cypher Block Chaining (CBC) has been implemented. 
Twofish, Serpent, and CAST256 are planned for release soon.

Crypt is written entirely in ruby so deployment is simple - 
no platform concerns, no library dependencies, nothing to compile.
