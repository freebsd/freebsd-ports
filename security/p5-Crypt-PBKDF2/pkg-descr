PBKDF2 is a secure password hashing algorithm that uses the techniques of
"key strengthening" to make the complexity of a brute-force attack arbitrarily
high. PBKDF2 uses any other cryptographic hash or cipher (by convention,
usually HMAC-SHA1, but Crypt::PBKDF2 is fully pluggable), and allows for an
arbitrary number of iterations of the hashing function, and a nearly unlimited
output hash size (up to 2**32 - 1 times the size of the output of the backend
hash). The hash is salted, as any password hash should be, and the salt may
also be of arbitrary size.
