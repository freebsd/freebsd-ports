===>  CONFIGURATION NOTE:

  Configuration of sshit is done via main configuration file
  located at %%PREFIX%%/etc/sshit.conf

  To run the script, add a line in /etc/syslog.conf:

auth.info;authpriv.info                         |exec %%PREFIX%%/sbin/sshit

  and restart syslogd.

  If you want to use pf as the firewall, you should add a table and the
  corresponding deny rule. For example,
  (In /etc/pf.conf)

table <badhosts> persist
block on $extdev from <badhosts> to any

  and reload the pf rules.

  If you want to use ipfw2 (with table) as the firewall, you should add a
  table and the corresponding deny rule. For example,

# ipfw add deny ip from table(0) to any
