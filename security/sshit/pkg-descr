sshit is a perl script, which works along with ipfw, ipfw2, and pf.
It parses the output of syslogd, find out SSH/FTP bruteforce attacks.
If the number of failed login is more than a threshold that administarator
set, sshit will block the source IP via firewall for a while
(administrators can set the period of blocking).
