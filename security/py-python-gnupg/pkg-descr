The gnupg module allows Python programs to make use of the functionality
provided by the GNU Privacy Guard (abbreviated GPG or GnuPG). Using this
module, Python programs can encrypt and decrypt data, digitally sign documents
and verify digital signatures, manage (generate, list and delete) encryption
keys, using proven Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) encryption technology based
on OpenPGP.
