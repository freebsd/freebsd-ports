Ruby Exploitation(Rex) Library for Binary Manipulation.  This suite of tools
contains ElfScan, MachScan, PEScan, and BinScan.  These tools are designed to
help you analyze an executable binary and search for particular instruction
sets.  This is particularly useful for things like building ROP chains or SEH
exploits.
