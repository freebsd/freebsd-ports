A generic interface for cryptographic operations, platform independent quality
RNG, property tests and known-answer tests (KATs) for common algorithms, and a
basic benchmark infrastructure. Maintainers of hash and cipher implementations
are encouraged to add instances for the classes defined in Crypto.Classes.
Crypto users are similarly encouraged to use the interfaces defined in the
Classes module.  Any concepts or functions of general use to more than one
cryptographic algorithm (ex: padding) is within scope of this package.
