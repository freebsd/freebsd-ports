Webfwlog is a flexible web-based analysis and reporting tool for firewall
logs.  It supports log files in standard ipfilter or ipfw format.

With Webfwlog you can design reports to use on your firewall logs in whatever
configuration you desire.  Included are example reports as a starting
point.  You can sort a report with a single click, "drill-down" on the reports
all the way to the packet level, and save your reports for later use.  You can
also create a link directly to any saved report.

Webfwlog requires a web server with PHP support and a MySQL or PostgresSQL
database server.
