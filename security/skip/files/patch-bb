+Using SKIP and FreeBSD's NAT (Network Address Translation) together
+-------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Skip and NAT are two very popular strategies for building secure 
+networks with FreeBSD.  They are sometimes believed to be incompatable 
+when applied to the same interface.  They will work together, however,  
+when correctly configured.  This document addresses the reference 
+implementation of SKIP (1.0) and natd as implemented through ipfw.
+
+The key to understanding the operation of SKIP and NAT in parallel is to 
+realize that inbound packets traverse the ipfw ruleset twice - once as an 
+encapsulated packet and once as an de-encapsulated packet with the 
+original destination address restored.  Outbound packets, on the other
+hand, make a single pass in the unencapsulated state.  This understanding
+can be used to advantage in building a nomadic SKIP server.  A nomadic SKIP
+server allows any host equipped with a SKIP client to connect to the
+Internet (eg. via a dialup connection to an ISP) and then establish a
+secure connection to the nomadic SKIP server allowing full access to a
+Local Area Network.  Because the remote host may have a different IP
+address each time it connects it is known as a nomad and its KeyID is
+used for identification rather than the IP address identification normally
+used to establish authenticity.
+
+The primary difficulty in setting up a nomadic server in conjunction with 
+NAT is not in reaching in to the LAN but in returning a response to the 
+remote host.  The remote host IP address cannot, by definition, be known 
+in advance.  Further - authentication of the remote host and 
+identification of its IP address by the SKIP module does not proceed to 
+update the routing tables in the kernel.  A LAN host receiving a 
+connection request has insufficient information to reply to the remote 
+host either via a static route or by dynamic routing.
+
+This leads to the requirement that the nomadic server must be in-line 
+between the Internet and the LAN so that all packets not destined for the 
+LAN are routed to the nomadic server by the gateway address in the LAN 
+host.
+
+The second requirement is to prevent NAT from interfering.  NAT does 
+not bother the SKIP pass as the packet header is directed to the 
+nat/skiphost.  You can count the inbound SKIP packets as they 
+can be identified by the SKIP protocol (57).  Use an ipfw rule 
+before the NAT rule such as:
+
+00010 allow skip from any to any in recv fxp0
+00100 divert 8668 ip from any to any via fxp0
+
+assuming that skip is identified as 57 in /etc/protocols.
+
+A rule is required for the de-encrypted packets to allow them to be 
+forwarded to the LAN by the routing mechanism without interference from 
+NAT during the second pass:
+
+00010 allow skip from any to any in recv fxp0
+00020 allow ip from any to 192.168.0.0/24 in recv fxp0
+00100 divert 8668 ip from any to any via fxp0
+
+Now you can have nomadic hosts connect securely as part of the LAN and 
+hosts on the LAN can continue to access the Internet through NAT. Of 
+course, you have to configure the skiphost ACL correctly and setup the 
+SKIP client on the nomad to match but that's covered in the 
+documentation.
