knockd is a port-knock server.  It monitors all traffic on an Ethernet (or PPP)
interface for special "knock" sequences of port-hits.

A client makes these port-hits by sending a TCP (or UDP) packet to a port on
the server.  The port need not be open -- since knockd monitors at the
link-layer level, it detects all traffic, even if destined for a closed port.
When the server detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it runs a command
defined in its configuration file.  The command can be used to open holes in a
firewall, for quick access.
