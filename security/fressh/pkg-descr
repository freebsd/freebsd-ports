FreSSH is a free implementation of the SSH communication protocol. 
It is compact, modular, portable, and designed for security and
performance.  It is a completely new implementation.  Unlike various
other SSH implementations already available for Unix, it does not
trace its ancestry to the original SSH code written by Tatu Ylonen. 
FreSSH currently implements SSH protocol version 1.5, with extensions
which offer enhanced security when both sides of a connection are
running FreSSH.
