NOTES FOR RUNNING COURIERPASSWD

In order to use courierpasswd, it must be able to access the
authdaemon domain socket, named 'socket'. When courierpasswd runs as
root, this presents no problem. However, if you need to run courierpasswd
as a non-root user, you have three options, all of which require some
manual work.

Option 1: Add the user courierpasswd will run as to the group that
owns the authdaemon socket directory in /etc/group. More than one user
can be added to the group vector in this way. This arrangement works
well if courierpasswd will be run by only a small number of users.
If the authdaemon socket directory is owned by courier:courier and you
run courierpasswd as user vmail, your /etc/group file will have a line
something like this:

    courier:x:465:vmail

Option 2: Some programs, such as tcpserver, allow you to separately set
the uid and gid of programs they call but don't honour the group vector
found in /etc/group. If you invoke courierpasswd from such a program,
set the gid to the group ownership of the authdaemon socket directory.
For tcpserver, you could do something like this:

    #!/bin/sh

    QMAILUID=`/usr/bin/id -u qmaild`
    COURIERGID=`/usr/bin/id -g courier`

    exec /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -u "$QMAILUID" -g "$COURIERGID" \
    0 smtp /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd /usr/local/sbin/courierpasswd -- \
    /usr/bin/true 2>&1

Option 3: Change the permissions on courierpasswd to set gid to the
group ownership of the socket directory. Again, if the socket directory
is owned by courier:courier, change the ownership and permissions
of courierpasswd like so:

    chgrp courier courierpasswd
    chmod g+s courierpasswd

Be aware that courierpasswd does not provide any max-failed-retry
functionality so it is possible for local users to perform dictionary
attacks against account passwords if courierpasswd is set up this way.

The location of the authdaemon domain socket is listed in the
authdaemonrc configuration file as the parameter authdaemonvar.
