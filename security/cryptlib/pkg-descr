cryptlib is a powerful security toolkit which allows even inexperienced
crypto programmers to easily add encryption and authentication services to
their software. The high-level interface provides anyone with the ability to
add strong security capabilities to an application in as little as half an
hour, without needing to know any of the low-level details which make the
encryption or authentication work. Because of this, cryptlib dramatically
reduces the cost involved in adding security to new or existing applications.

cryptlib provides a standardised interface to a number of popular encryption
algorithms, as well as providing a high-level interface which hides most of
the implementation details and provides an operating-system-independent
encoding method which makes it easy to transfer secured data from one operating
environment to another.
