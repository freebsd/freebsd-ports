Python OpenID library implements recent changes to the OpenID
specification as well as making API changes that should make
integration with applications easier.

This library allows the use of XRI as OpenID identifiers, allowing users
to log in with their i-names.  For full XRI compatibility,
relying parties integrating this library should take note of the user's
CanonicalID, as described in the "Identifying the End User" section of
the OpenID 2.0 specification.
