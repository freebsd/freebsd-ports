CALDERA a cyber security platform designed to easily automate adversary
emulation, assist manual red-teams, and automate incident response.

It is built on the MITRE ATT&CK framework and is an active research project 
at MITRE.

The framework consists of two components:

- The core system. This is the framework code, consisting of what is available
  in this repository. Included is an asynchronous command-and-control (C2)
  server with a REST API and a web interface.
- Plugins. These repositories expand the core framework capabilities and
  providing additional functionality. Examples include agents, reporting,
  collections of TTPs and more.
