Lynis is an auditing tool for Unix (specialists). It scans the
system and available software, to detect security issues. Beside
security related information it will also scan for general system
information, installed packages and configuration mistakes.

This software aims in assisting automated auditing, software patch
management, vulnerability and malware scanning of Unix based systems.
It can be run without prior installation, so inclusion on read only
storage is no problem (USB stick, cd/dvd).
