HotSSH is an interface to Secure Shell, for GNOME and OpenSSH. It
intends to be a better experience than simply invoking "ssh" from an
existing terminal window.

   * Fast search-based interface for new connections
   * Also display and search of local (Avahi) SSH servers
   * Tabbed display with automatic session saving (Firefox style)
   * Status bar with information like latency to server and output of
     remote uptime
   * Close integration with OpenSSH features like connection sharing
     (near-instant new tabs)
   * NetworkManager integration to easily reconnect after a network
     change, great for laptops
