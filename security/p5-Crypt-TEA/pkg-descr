TEA is a 64-bit symmetric block cipher with a 128-bit key and a variable number
of rounds (32 is recommended). It has a low setup time, and depends on a
large number of rounds for security, rather than a complex algorithm. It was
developed by David J. Wheeler and Roger M. Needham, and is described at
