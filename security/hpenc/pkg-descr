Hpenc is a fast encryption command line tool with the following features:

* Authenticated encryption - your data cannot be forged or corrupted without
detection.
* Parallel processing - hpenc uses block IO and you can process multiple blocks
simultaneously, which is extremely useful if you have multi-core environment.
* Strong ciphers - hpenc uses the state-of-art aes-gcm and chacha20 ciphers
* Easy interface
* Hardware acceleration - hpenc can utilize all its
advanced cryptography functions defined for AES-NI and PCLMULQDQ instructions
(that must be supported by openssl). For those with old or embedded CPU (such
as ARM), hpenc provides portable and fast chacha20 cipher.
* Simple key management
* Secure random numbers generator - hpenc can work as pseudo-random numbers
generator. In a set of standard tests (diehard) on the generated sequences
hpenc generates secure sequences of pseudo-random numbers on a very high
speed (gigabytes per second).
