OpenCDK - Open Crypto Development Kit

This library provides basic parts of the OpenPGP message format.
The aim of the library is *not* to replace any available OpenPGP version.
There will be no real support for key management (sign, revoke,
alter preferences, ...) and some other parts are only rudimentary
available. The main purpose is to handle and understand OpenPGP
packets and to use basic operations. For example to encrypt/decrypt
or to sign/verify and packet routines.

Hint: Because of the fact that sentensive data is used, the library
      doesn't contain any real cryptographic code. For all crypto
      routines we referring to the Libgcrypt library!
