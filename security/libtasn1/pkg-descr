libtasn1 library was developed for ASN1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)
structures management.

The main features of this library are:

- on-line ASN1 structure management that does not require any C code
  file generation;
- off-line ASN1 structure management with C code file generation
  containing an array;
- DER (Distinguish Encoding Rules) encoding;
- no limits for INTEGER and ENUMERATED values
