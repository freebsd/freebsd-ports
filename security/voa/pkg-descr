This project provides Rust libraries, command line tools and a test
suite to interact with the File Hierarchy for the Verification of
OS Artifacts (VOA).

The VOA specification has been created to provide the means for a
generic, OS artifact verification scheme, that can work with different
technologies while relying on a unifying lookup directory to retrieve
verifiers for signatures.

This project provides a reference implementation for the VOA
specification as well as a canonical test suite that is usable by
any other implementation.
