[ excerpt (with adaptations) from developer's WWW site ]

This is the Unix daemon required for the pGina PAM plugin.

We have developed this plugin to allow for authentication using
PAM. This means you can authenticate your windows machines against
an existing Unix user base without substantial changes!

Just install the Unix daemon, and the pGina plugin on windows and
your set!

Sound too good to be true? It's not!

As always, your mileage may vary.
