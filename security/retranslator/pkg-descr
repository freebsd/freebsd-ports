The update utility is designed to download and save updates and modules
of the Kaspersky Lab's applications into a separate folder.

With the help of the utility you can download updates for selected
Kaspersky Lab's applications installed either in your network or at
a home PC. The utility has a function for saving downloaded updates
and autopatches in a local folder, a network folder connected as a
disc to the computer file system, or onto a flash-carrier.
