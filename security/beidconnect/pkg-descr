BeIDConnect is a browser extension to sign documents with a Belgian eID
card.

Only belgium.be and fgov.be websites can make use of the BeIDConnect
extension to create an electronic signature.  These websites are
operated by institutions of the Belgian federal government.

This package only contains the backend that connects with your card
reader.  The extension itself has to be installed through your web
browser.
