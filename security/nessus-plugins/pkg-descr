Nessus is a security scanner. That is, it's a program which will scan a
given network and will seek for vulnerabilities which could be exploited
by some remote intruder.

The Nessus Project was originally started by Renaud Deraison
(deraison@worldnet.fr). Many people contributed in many ways to the
project, and the Nessus core team is now made up of Alexis de Bernis
(alexisb@mygale.org), who is the Java specialist, Noam Rathaus
(dolittle@isrealmail.com) who is in charge of the Nessus client for
Windows, and Renaud Deraison who is still here and who is the project
leader.
