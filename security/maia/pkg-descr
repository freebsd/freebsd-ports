Maia Mailguard is a web-based interface and management system based on the
popular amavisd-new e-mail scanner and SpamAssassin. Written in Perl and PHP,
Maia Mailguard gives end-users control over how their mail is processed by
virus scanners and spam filters, while giving mail administrators the power
to configure site-wide defaults and limits.
