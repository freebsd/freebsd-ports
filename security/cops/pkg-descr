Cops is a set of programs to check how secure your system is.  It
checks file and directory privileges, SUID programs, etc.  It has
support for checking passwords, but this port doesn't include it
as it is DES based.  This port installs cops in a single directory
area.  The directory has no non-user privileges and cops is meant
to be run locally to that directory.  The perl version of cops is
also included in a subdirectory.
