Cops is a set of programs to check how secure your
system is.  It checks file and directory privledges,
SUID programs, etc.  It has support for checking
passwords, but this port doesn't include it as it
is DES based.  This port installs cops in a single
directory area.  The directory has no non-user
privledges and cops is meant to be run locally to
that directory.  The perl version of cops is also
included in a subdirectory.

This is version 1.04
