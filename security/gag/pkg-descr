"gag" is a program to scan for "stacheldraht" agents, which are part
of an active "stacheldraht" network.  It will not detect trinoo,
the original Tribe Flood Network (TFN), or TFN2K agents.  For methods
of detecting trinoo and Tribe Flood Network, see:

(Why "gag"?  Its supposed to be a running joke I started in the trinoo
analysis.  trinoo/trinot, "tribe"/civilize, gag/sicken&gesundheit!.
Read the ddos trilogy to find out!)
