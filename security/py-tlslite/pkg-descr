TLS Lite is a free python library that implements SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, and TLS
1.1. TLS Lite supports non-traditional authentication methods such as SRP,
shared keys, and cryptoIDs in addition to X.509 certificates. TLS Lite is pure
Python, however it can access OpenSSL, cryptlib, pycrypto, and GMPY for faster
crypto operations. TLS Lite integrates with httplib, xmlrpclib, poplib,
imaplib, smtplib, SocketServer, asyncore, and Twisted.
