Hockeypuck implements the HKP draft protocol specification,
as well as several extensions to the protocol supported by SKS.

Public key material conforming to RFC 4880 is supported by the keyserver,
as are RFC 6637 ECC keys.
As-of-yet unsupported key material, such as recent Ed25519 signing keys,
may be distributed by Hockeypuck, however Hockeypuck is not able to
validate them yet.
