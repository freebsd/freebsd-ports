Sguil (pronounced "sgweel") is a graphical interface to snort
(www.snort.org), an open source intrusion detection system.
The actual interface and GUI server are written in tcl/tk
(www.tcl.tk). Sguil also relies on other open source software
in order to function properly.

The client requires tls, gpg, iwidgets and other tcl packages and may
also use wireshark, sancp and festival depending on your selection
of options.  Run "make config" in the port to see what options
are available.

Sguil currently functions as an analysis interface and does not yet
have rule management capabilities.
