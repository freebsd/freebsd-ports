[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

I2P is an anonymous overlay network - a network within a network.
It is intended to protect communication from dragnet surveillance
and monitoring by third parties such as ISPs.

I2P is used by many people who care about their privacy: activists,
oppressed people, journalists and whistleblowers, as well as the
average person.

No network can be "perfectly anonymous". The continued goal of I2P
is to make attacks more and more difficult to mount. Its anonymity
will get stronger as the size of the network increases and with
ongoing academic review.
