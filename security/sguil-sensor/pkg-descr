Sguil (pronounced "sgweel") is a graphical interface to snort
(www.snort.org), an open source intrusion detection system.
The actual interface and GUI server are written in tcl/tk
(www.tcl.tk). Sguil also relies on other open source software
in order to function properly.

The sensor list includes security/barnyard, security/snort, 
security/sancp, net-mgmt/pads, tcpdump (a part of the OS) 
and devel/tcltls as well as lang/tcl84 and lang/tclX.  Care 
has been taken to ensure that everything you need to build 
a working sguil operation is in the FreeBSD ports system or 
is part of the OS already. 

Sguil currently functions as an analysis interface and has
rule management capabilities.
