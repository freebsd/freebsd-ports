            ***********************************

If you already had barnyard installed, this port will NOT deinstall
it and install the barnyard-sguil6 port instead.  You will need to
deinstall the barnyard port and install the barnyard-sguil6 port yourself
instead.  This port WILL NOT WORK without the barnyard-sguil6 port!!

You MUST edit the log_packets.conf file (located in %%PREFIX%%/etc/%%SGUILDIR%%)
to fit your configuration before running the log_packets.sh script.
See the %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL doc for details on the 
configuration and for croning the script.  

WARNING!!!  Sguil et al will fill up your /tmp directory very 
quickly.  You should probably configure sguil et al to log to
another partition/location (e.g. /nsm/tmp/).

You must ALSO edit all of the sensor conf fileis (located in 
%%PREFIX%%/%%SGUILDIR%%/etc/) to reflect your configuration before 
starting the sensor_agents.

If you chose to run sancp, and you already had a sancp.conf file in
%%PREFIX%%/etc, copy it to sancp.conf.orig before creating the new one.
The new sancp.conf-sample file contains the settings for squil.
If you still want to maintain the customized sancp.conf file, then copy 
the new sancp.conf-sample file to sguild-sancp.conf (for example) and 
add sancp_conf=%%PREFIX%%/etc/sguild-sancp.conf to /etc/rc.conf.
