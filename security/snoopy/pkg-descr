snoopy is merely a shared library that is used as a wrapper to the execve()
function provided by libc as to log every call to syslog (authpriv). System
administrators may find snoopy useful in tasks such as light/heavy system
monitoring, tracking other administrator's actions as well as getting a good
'feel' of what's going on in the system (for example Apache running CGI
scripts).
