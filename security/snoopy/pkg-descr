snoopy is merely a shared library that is used as a wrapper
to the execve() function provided by libc as to log every call
to syslog (authpriv).  system administrators may find snoopy
useful in tasks such as light/heavy system monitoring, tracking other
administrator's actions as well as getting a good 'feel' of
what's going on in the system (for example apache running cgi
scripts).
