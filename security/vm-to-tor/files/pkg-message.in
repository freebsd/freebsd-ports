======================================================================
You installed vm-to-tor: framework that allows to connect virtual
machines to the tor network.

It requires sysctl variable net.link.tap.user_open=1 set in
/etc/sysctl.conf.

To start vm-to-tor manually, you can use this command:
# service vm-to-tor onestart
This will connect an adapter tap0 to tor. Then you need to change
settings of one virtual machine to use tap0 interface (in VirtualBox
you need to set "Bridged Adapter" as a network type and choose tap0
as an adapter name, in bhyve tap0 will just work).

To enable at system startup, you can add one of these lines:
. %%PREFIX%%/etc/vm-to-tor.rc.conf.simple
or
. %%PREFIX%%/etc/vm-to-tor.rc.conf.complex
to /etc/rc.conf, and modify %%PREFIX%%/etc/vm-to-tor.rc.conf.*
according to your needs. Please read there the explanation of
vm-to-tor features.

Before changing configuration, you need to stop vm-to-tor with
# service vm-to-tor {one}stop
After changing configuration, you need to start it again:
# service vm-to-tor start

To see the status of vm-to-tor:
# service vm-to-tor status

To connect to the virtual machine tap1 with ssh:
# ssh 172.16.1.2

To change tor router setting for machine tapN with ctrl protocol:
# vm-ctrl tapN

By design, you can't connect to the host from the virtual machine for
security reasons. Machine is isolated from the host environment, and
is not host-aware. Besides the optional NFS connection, all
communication initiated by the virtual machine happens only through
tor.
