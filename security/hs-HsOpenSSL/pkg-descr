HsOpenSSL is an OpenSSL binding for Haskell. It can generate RSA and DSA
keys, read and write PEM files, generate message digests, sign and
verify messages, encrypt and decrypt messages. It has also some
capabilities of creating SSL clients and servers. Please note that this
project has started at the time when there were no pure-Haskell
implementations of TLS. Now there is tls package, which looks pretty
saner than HsOpenSSL especially for initialisation and error handlings.
So PHO (the initial author of HsOpenSSL) highly encourages you to use
and improve the tls package instead as long as possible.
