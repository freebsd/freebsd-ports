Bytes::Random::Secure provides two interfaces for obtaining crypto-quality
random bytes. The simple interface is built around plain functions. For greater
control over the Random Number Generator's seeding, there is an Object Oriented
interface that provides much more flexibility.

The "functions" interface provides functions that can be used any time you need
a string of a specific number of random bytes. The random bytes are available as
simple strings, or as hex-digits, Quoted Printable, or MIME Base64. There are
equivalent methods available from the OO interface, plus a few others.

This module can be a drop-in replacement for Bytes::Random, with the primary
enhancement of using a cryptographic-quality random number generator to create
the random data. The random_bytes function emulates the user interface of
Bytes::Random's function by the same name. But with Bytes::Random::Secure the
random number generator comes from Math::Random::ISAAC, and is suitable for
cryptographic purposes. The harder problem to solve is how to seed the
generator. This module uses Crypt::Random::Seed to generate the initial seeds
for Math::Random::ISAAC.
