KeyNote is a simple and flexible trust-management system designed to
work well for a variety of large- and small- scale Internet-based
applications.  It provides a single, unified language for both local
policies and credentials.  KeyNote policies and credentials, called
`assertions,' contain predicates that describe the trusted actions
permitted by the holders of specific public keys.  KeyNote assertions
are essentially small, highly-structured programs.  A signed
assertion, which can be sent over an untrusted network, is also
called a `credential assertion.'  Credential assertions, which also
serve the role of certificates, have the same syntax as policy
assertions but are also signed by the principal delegating the trust.

This is an example implementation of the KeyNote Trust-Management System
as specified in IETF draft <draft-blaze-ietf-trustmgt-keynote-02.txt>.
