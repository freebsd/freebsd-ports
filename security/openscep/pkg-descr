OpenSCEP is an open source implementation of the SCEP protocol used by Cisco
routers for certificate enrollment to build VPNs. It implements most of the
draft specification.

OpenSCEP includes a client and a server implementation, as well as some CGI
programs to simplify certificate and revocation list management.
