Sudosh2 is a tool which can provide systems administrators with extensive
auditing of user shell usage.

There are two distinct modes of operation for sudosh2: as a filter for sudo,
and directly as a login shell. In either case, you will be able to audit
user sessions by replaying them to your screen, much like a VCR.

Sudosh2 is a fork of sudosh (by Douglas Hanks). He stopped updating sudosh
in 2005, and this fork was created in 2007. Sudosh2 is licensed with the
Open Source License v2.0.
