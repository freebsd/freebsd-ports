crowdsec-firewall-bouncer is installed.

Note: If you are using OPNsense or pfSense, ignore the following instructions and use the settings page of the
CrowdSec plugin.

-----

If you are running crowdsec on this machine, the bouncer will register itself with
the Local API when it's started the first time.

If the LAPI is on a different machine, you need to manually register the bouncer
and fill api_key and api_url in %%ETCDIR%%/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.yaml before
starting the service.

This package depends on the Packet Filter service.
To make sure it's active:

----------
# service pf enable
pf enabled in /etc/rc.conf
# service pf start
Enabling pf.
----------

Add the following in /etc/pf.conf to create the firewall tables and rules. If the start
command complained about missing pf.conf, you'll have to run it again.

----------
table <crowdsec-blacklists> persist
table <crowdsec6-blacklists> persist
block drop in quick from <crowdsec-blacklists> to any
block drop in quick from <crowdsec6-blacklists> to any
----------

If you already have any pass rule, you may want to put the block rules before them.

To apply the file:

# pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

Then activate the bouncer service and run it:

----------
# service crowdsec_firewall enable
crowdsec_firewall enabled in /etc/rc.conf
# service crowdsec_firewall start
----------
