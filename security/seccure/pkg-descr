The seccure toolset implements a selection of asymmetric algorithms 
based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). In particular it offers 
public key encryption / decryption, signature  generation / 
verification and key establishment.

ECC schemes offer a much better key size to security ratio than 
classical systems (RSA, DSA). Keys are short enough to make direct 
specification of keys on the command line possible (sometimes this 
is more convenient than the management of PGP-like key rings).
seccure builds on this feature and therefore is the tool of choice 
whenever lightweight asymmetric cryptography -- independent of key 
servers, revocation certificates, the Web of Trust or even 
configuration files -- is required.
