To view the statistics via you browser you must:
create a symlink, like:
cd /usr/local/www/data ; ln -s ../amavis-stats amavis-stats

or modify your Apache httpd.conf including this line:
Alias /amavis-stats %%PREFIX%%/www/amavis-stats

You can view then the statistics in http://your-site/amavis-stats

To update the statistics every 5 minutes, you also
can setup cronjob for amavis-stats by putting this line to /etc/crontab
*/5 * * * * amavis %%PREFIX%%/sbin/amavis-stats /var/log/maillog 2>&1 > /dev/null
