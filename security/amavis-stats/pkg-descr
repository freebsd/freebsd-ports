amavis-stats is a simple AMaViS statistics generator based on rrdtool.
It produces graphs of clean emails, spam emails and infected emails
broken down by virus, from amavis log entries. RRD files are created
and updated by a perl script run from cron. Graphs are generated by
a php script and viewed with a web browser.
