Pwned Passwords are hundreds of millions of real world passwords exposed in 
data breaches. This exposure makes them unsuitable for ongoing use as they
are at much greater risk of being used to take over other accounts. 

This script uses a downloaded copy of the pwned passwort hashes available
from https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords/ to allow passwords to be locally
checked, whether they are known to have been obtained in a data breach and
therefore should not be used.
