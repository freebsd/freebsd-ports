.Op Fl u
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility checks the passwords piped in via standard input  (one per line)
against a huge database of passwords that are known to have been stolen
in data breaches.
.Pp
SHA1 hashes of these passwords have been published at
.Lk https://haveibeenpwned.com/
.Pp
If any of the checked passwords is found in the database, it is printed
on standard output and the exit status of
.Nm
is set to 1.
No output is generated for passwords not found in the database.
.Pp
Instead of plain passwords, SHA1 hashes of passwords may be supplied.
Matches will be reported, but there is no provision to report the
plain text password corresponding to a given SHA1 hash.
.Pp
If the option
.Fl u
is used, the password hash database is downloaded and initialized.
This process will temporarily require some 18 GB of free space in the
database directory, which is
.Pa /var/db/pwned-check
by default.
This location can be changed in the configuration file, prior to starting
the download.

option is used to download the pwned password hashes, an exit code of 0
indicates success, 1 failure to fetch and initialize the database.
