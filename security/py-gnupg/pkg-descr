This module allows easy access to GnuPG's key management, encryption and
signature functionality from Python programs, by interacting with GnuPG through
file descriptors. Input arguments are strictly checked and sanitised, and
therefore this module should be safe to use in networked applications requiring
direct user input. It is intended for use with Python 2.6 or greater.

This is a fork of python-gnupg-0.3.2, patched to fix a potential vulnerability
which could result in remote code execution, do to unsanitised inputs being
passed to subprocess.Popen([...], shell=True).
