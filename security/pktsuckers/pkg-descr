The two programs tcpsuck and udpsuck run out of the Inetd daemon on
unused ports. They log the contents of packets or connections to these
ports. This allows you to read the contents of the network strobe
attacks on your machine. It also slows the strobes down, as they think
you're actually running a service on several ports when you aren't.
