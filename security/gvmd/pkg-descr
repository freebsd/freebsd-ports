The Greenbone Vulnerability Manager is the central management service between
security scanners and the user clients.

It manages the storage of any vulnerability management configurations and of
the scan results. Access to data, control commands and workflows is offered
via the XML-based Greenbone Management Protocol (GMP). Controlling scanners
like OpenVAS is done via the Open Scanner Protocol (OSP).
