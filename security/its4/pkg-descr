ITS4 is  a tool  that   statically scans C  and   C++ source code  for
potential security vulnerabilities.   It  is a command-line  tool that
works across Unix  environments  (hopefully) and will also  work under
Windows with CygWin installed.  ITS4  scans code, looking for function
calls that  are potentially dangerous.  For some  calls, ITS4 tries to
perform some code analysis  to determine  how  risky the call is.   In
each    case,  ITS4 provides  a  problem    report, including  a short
description of the potential problem and suggestions on how to fix the
code.
