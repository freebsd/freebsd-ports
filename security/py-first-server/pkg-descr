The main idea behind FIRST is to preserve an engineer's analysis of
certain functions (name, prototype, comment, etc) by using methods
like opcode hashing, mnemonic hashing, locality sensitive hashing,
etc. By collecting and storing these signatures centrally the framework
can provide them later to the community via the API/Plugin. The goal is
to provide quick lookups for similar functions (see Fig. A) to avoid
losing time with analysing a function which was already analysed before
in another sample or by another engineer.
