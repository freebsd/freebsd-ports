Twisted Conch is an SSHv2 implementation written in Python. SSH is a protocol
designed to allow remote access to shells and commands, but it is generic
enough to allow everything from TCP forwarding to generic filesystem access.
Since conch is written in Python, it interfaces well with other Python
projects, such as Imagination. Conch also includes a implementations of the
telnet and vt102 protocols, as well as support for rudamentary line editing
behaviors. A new implementation of Twisted's Manhole application is also
included, featuring server-side input history and interactive syntax coloring.
