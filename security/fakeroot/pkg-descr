Fakeroot runs a command in an environment were it appears to have
root privileges for file manipulation, by setting LD_PRELOAD to a
library with alternative versions of getuid(), stat(), etc. This
is useful for allowing users to create archives (tar, ar, .deb .rpm
etc.) with files in them with root permissions/ownership.
