Solitaire is a top-notch pencil-and-paper encryption system developed
by Bruce Schneier. Here is the description in Schneier's own words:

"Solitaire gets its security from the inherent randomness in a
shuffled deck of cards. By manipulating this deck, a communicant
can create a string of "random" letters that he then combines with
his message. Of course Solitaire can be simulated on a computer,
but it is designed to be implemented by hand.

"Solitaire may be low-tech, but its security is intended to be
high-tech. I designed Solitaire to be secure even against the most
well-funded military adversaries with the biggest computers and the
smartest cryptanalysts. Of course, there is no guarantee that someone
won't find a clever attack against Solitaire, but the algorithm is
certainly better than any other pencil-and-paper cipher I've ever
seen."

Simple system, easy to use, and relatively fast.
