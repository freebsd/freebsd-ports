The python bindings for yara.

"YARA is a tool aimed at helping malware researchers to identify and classify
malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families
based on textual or binary patterns contained on samples of those families.
Each description consists of a set of strings and a Boolean expression which
determines its logic."
