PEDA (Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB) is a plugin for GDB. It
extends GDB with a colorful text-based UI making it easier to work with the
debugger.

Note that PEDA requires that GDB is compiled with Python support.

Its key features are:

- Enhance the display of GDB: colorize and display disassembly codes,
  registers, memory information during debugging.
- Add commands to support debugging and exploit development.
