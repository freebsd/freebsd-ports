Should you installed the py36 flavor of this package and are presented to
the following error:

  RuntimeError: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was
  configured to use ASCII as encoding for the environment. Either switch
  to Python 2 or consult the Python 3 section of the docs for
  mitigation steps.

It's an issue related to Click, not muacrypt. You can workaround that by
exporting LC_ALL and LANG variables, using your locale settings and
running muacrypt again:

  # setenv LC_ALL en_US.UTF-8
  # setenv LANG en_US.UTF-8
  # muacrypt
