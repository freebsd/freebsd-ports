Arti is a complete rewrite of the C Tor codebase, and it is currently under
active development. It is written in Rust, and it is designed to be modular,
reusable, and easy to audit.

This is the full version of the port, offering additional features and
binaries, for example to run onion services. For regular client mode, the
default version is just fine.
