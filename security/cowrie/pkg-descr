Cowrie is a medium and high interaction SSH and Telnet honeypot.

Cowrie is designed to log brute force attacks and the shell interaction
performed by an attacker. In medium interaction mode, it emulates a shell
and filesystem, while in high interaction mode, it proxies traffic to
another host.

Features:
- Fake filesystem with the ability to add/remove files.
- Session logging in a format compatible with `ttyrec`.
- Stores files uploaded with SFTP and SCP for later analysis.
- Logs events to JSON files for processing with tools like Elasticsearch.
