Easy-RSA is a small RSA key management package, based on the openssl
command line tool, that can be found in the easy-rsa subdirectory of the
OpenVPN distribution.  While this tool is primary concerned with key
management for the SSL VPN application space, it can also be used for
building web certificates.
