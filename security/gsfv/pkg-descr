GSFV is a graphical interface written in GTK+ for manipulating .sfv
(Simple File Verification) files.

The Simple File Verification (SFV) system is a file integrity verification
system which is popular on some platforms.  A software package may be
accompanied by an SFV file (usually with extension .sfv) which contains
CRC-32 checksums for all the files that comprise the package.
