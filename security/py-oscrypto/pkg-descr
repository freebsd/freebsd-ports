oscrypto is a compilation-free, always up-to-date encryption library for Python
that works on Windows, OS X, Linux and BSD.

The library integrates with the encryption library that is part of the operating
system. This means that a compiler is never needed, and OS security updates take
care of patching vulnerabilities.
