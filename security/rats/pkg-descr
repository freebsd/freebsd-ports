This is RATS, a rough auditing tool for security, developed by
Secure Software Solutions.  It is a tool for scanning source code
(C, C++, Perl, and Python) and flagging common security related
programming errors such as buffer overflows and TOCTOU (Time Of
Check, Time Of Use) race conditions.  As its name implies, the tool
performs only a rough analysis of source code.  It will not find
every error and will also find things that are not errors.  Manual
inspection of your code is still necessary, but greatly aided with
this tool.
