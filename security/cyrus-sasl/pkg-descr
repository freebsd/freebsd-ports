	This is a port of Cyrus SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer).
SASL is a method for adding authentication support to connection-based
protocols.  To use SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating protection of
subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is negotiated, a security layer is
inserted between the protocol and the connection.
	The following mechanisms are included in this distribution: ANONYMOUS,
CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT Kerberos 5 or Heimdal Kerberos 5), KERBEROS_V4
and PLAIN.
	The library can use a Berkeley DB, gdbm or ndbm file on the server side
to store per-user authentication secrets.  The utility saslpasswd has been
included for adding authentication secrets to the file.
	PLAIN can either check /etc/passwd, Kerberos V4, use PAM, or the sasl
secrets database.  By default PAM is used if PAM is found, then Kerberos,
finally /etc/passwd (non-shadow).  This is tweakable in the configuration file.
Please see "${PREFIX}/share/doc/sasl/sysadmin.html".
	The sample directory contains two programs which provide a reference for
using the library, as well as making it easy to test a mechanism on the command
line.  See "${PREFIX}/share/doc/sasl/programming.html" for more information.
