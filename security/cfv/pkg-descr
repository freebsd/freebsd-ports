cfv is a utility to both test and create .sfv, .csv and md5sum files. These
files are commonly used to ensure the correct retrieval or storage of data.

Features:
   - supports .sfv, .csv(2, 3, and 4 field variants), md5sum, bsd md5
     sha1sum, .torrent and (test-only) .par, .par2 file formats
   - automatic checksum file naming ability in create mode
   - recursive operation
   - show unverified files option
   - ignore case and fix path seperator options for cross platform use
   - transparent gzip support for checksum files
   - configurable renaming of bad files (with testing against previous bad
     files, to save only unique differing copies)
