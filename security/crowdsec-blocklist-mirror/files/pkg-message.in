  message: <<EOM

crowdsec-blocklist-mirror is installed.

If you are running crowdsec on this machine, the bouncer will register itself with
the Local API when it's started the first time.

If the LAPI is on another machine, you need to manually register the bouncer
and fill lapi_key and lapi_url in %%ETCDIR%%/crowdsec-blocklist-mirror.yaml before
starting the service.

Please refer to the documentation at
https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/bouncers/blocklist-mirror/

Then activate the bouncer via sysrc and run it:

----------
# sysrc crowdsec_mirror_enable="YES"
crowdsec_mirror_enable: NO -> YES
# service crowdsec_mirror start
----------

The blocklist is available by default at
'http://127.0.0.1:41412/security/blocklist', check the configuration file to
change address, endpoint or add some authentication.
