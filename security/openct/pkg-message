********************************************************
Before using OpenCT, you should create the configuration
file, by copying the installed sample.

To enable hot-plug support for your USB reader/token,
you need a devd enabled system. A configuration sample
for the Aladdin eToken PRO crypto token has been put
in the examples directory.
