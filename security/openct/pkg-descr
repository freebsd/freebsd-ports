OpenCT is a middleware framework for smart card terminals.

OpenCT implements drivers for several smart card readers.
It comes as driver in ifdhandler format for PC/SC-Lite,
as CT-API driver, or as a small and lean middleware, so
applications can use it with minimal overhead.
OpenCT also has a primitive mechanism to export smart card
readers to remote machines via TCP/IP.
