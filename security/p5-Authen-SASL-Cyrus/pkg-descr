SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network
protocols.  Authen::SASL::Cyrus provides an implementation framework
that all protocols should be able to share.

The XS framework makes calls into the existing libsasl2.so shared
library to perform SASL client connection functionality, including
loading existing shared library mechanisms.
