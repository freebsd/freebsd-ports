This module implements a chaining block cipher using a one
way hash. This method of encryption is the same that is
used by radius (RFC2138) and is also described in Applied
Cryptography.
Two interfaces are provided in the module. The first is
straight block encryption/decryption the second does base64
mime encoding/decoding of the encrypted/decrypted blocks.
The idea is the two sides have a shared secret that
supplies one of the keys and a randomly generated block of
bytes provides the second key. The random key is passed in
cleartext between the two sides.
An example client and server are packaged as modules with
this module. They are used in the tests.
