Digest::BubbleBabble takes a message digest (generated by
either of the MD5 or SHA-1 message digest algorithms) and creates
a fingerprint of that digest in "bubble babble" format.
Bubble babble is a method of representing a message digest
as a string of "real" words, to make the fingerprint easier
to remember. The "words" are not necessarily real words, but
they look more like words than a string of hex characters.

Bubble babble fingerprinting is used by the SSH2 suite
(and, consequently, by Net::SSH::Perl, the Perl SSH
implementation) to display easy-to-remember key fingerprints.
The key (a DSA or RSA key) is converted into a textual form,
digested using Digest::SHA1, and run through bubblebabble
to create the key fingerprint.
