Sst  can  be used to connect to SSL-encrypted network ser-
vices or it can be used as an  SSL  front-end  to  network
servers.   Sst  can  be used interactively, or in an inetd
setting, or it can be embedded inside other programs  (eg.
Amanda).


One of the main goals of sst is to be as basic as possible
so in most non-embedded cases sst uses netcat to setup the
networking  I/O.  Sst uses a socketpair(2) pipe to stay in
contact with its netcat child process.  In  this  way  sst
only has to concern itself with file descriptors.

In the embedded mode sst expects the parent program to set
up the networking I/O and to provide the appropriate  file
descriptors.   In  embedded client mode ("-c"), clear data
is read from (or written to) stdin  (fildes  0)  and  SSL-
encrypted data is read from (or written to) stdout (fildes
1).  In embedded server mode ("-s"), SSL-encrypted data is
read  from  (or written to) stdin and clear data read from
(or written to) stdout.
