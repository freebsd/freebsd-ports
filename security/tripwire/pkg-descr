Tripwire is a tool that aids system administrators and
users in monitoring a designated set of files for any changes.
Used with system files on a regular (e.g., daily) basis, Tripwire
can notify system administrators of corrupted or tampered files,
so damage control measures can be taken in a timely manner.
