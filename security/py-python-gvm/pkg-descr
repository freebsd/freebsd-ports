The Greenbone Vulnerability Management Python API library (python-gvm) is a
collection of APIs that help with remote controlling a Greenbone Security
Manager (GSM) appliance and its underlying Greenbone Vulnerability Manager
(GVM).

The library essentially abstracts accessing the communication protocols
Greenbone Management Protocol (GMP) and Open Scanner Protocol (OSP)
