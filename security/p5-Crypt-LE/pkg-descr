Crypt::LE provides the functionality necessary to use Let's Encrypt
API and generate free SSL certificates for your domains. It can
also be used to generate RSA keys and Certificate Signing Requests
or to revoke previously issued certificates. Crypt::LE is shipped
with a self-sufficient client for obtaining SSL certificates -
le.pl.

The client supports 'http' and 'dns' domain verification out of the box.
