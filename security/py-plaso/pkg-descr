Plaso is the Python based back-end engine used by tools such as log2timeline
for automatic creation of a super timelines. The goal of log2timeline (and thus
plaso) is to provide a single tool that can parse various log files and
forensic artifacts from computer and related systems, such as network equipment
to produce a single correlated timeline. This timeline can then be easily
analysed by forensic investigators/analysts, speeding up investigations by
correlating the vast amount of information found on an average computer system.
