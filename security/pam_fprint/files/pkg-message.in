The security/fprint_demo port contains the graphical `fprint_demo'
application that allows you to manage your finger prints in a comfortable
way.

After enrolling fingerprints for your user(s), you can enable finger
print authentication by adding the following line to the corresponding
PAM configuration file(s) (see the PAM documentation and the pam_fprint
web site for more information).

auth            sufficient      %%PREFIX%%/lib/pam_fprint.so

/etc/pam.d/system is used for system-wide defaults,
/etc/pam.d/{gdm, kde} are used by the GDM/KDM login managers.
