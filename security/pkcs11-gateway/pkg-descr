pkcs11-gateway is a software that allows you to use a Linux 32-bit PKCS#11
module on FreeBSD i386/amd64.
It consists of a FreeBSD Cryptoki wrapper library that serializes and forwards
PKCS#11 function calls to a Linux server program that dlopen() and use the
real module. The communication between the two components is via a UNIX socket.
pkcs11-gateway is based on the rpc-layer of Gnome Keyring.
