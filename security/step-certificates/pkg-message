Step Certificates requires additional configuration:

The simple way is via the service start script step_ca with:
service step_ca configure
When there is no configuration it will be created. User input is required!!!

The hard way would be manually via the step command.

Ensure to set the STEPPATH environment variable. This makes using the
commands much simpler.

Following are the defaults for step certificates and can be overridden by rc.conf variables::
* The service is run under user step customizable by step_ca_user
* The service is run inder group step customizable by step_ca_group
* The base directory used for storing CA information is step_ca_stepdir (%%PREFIX%%/etc/step)
* The CA informations is held under step_ca_steppath (%%PREFIX%%/etc/step/ca)
* The password required for automatic startup is in step_ca_password (%%PREFIX%%/etc/step/password.txt)
* By default step certificates logs to syslog with a tag of step_ca
