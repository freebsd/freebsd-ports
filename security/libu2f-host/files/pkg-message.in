======================================================================

The package requires read/write access to USB devices. To facilitate
such access it comes with a devd.conf(5) file, but you still need to
restart devd(8), add the desired users to "u2f" group and log those
out of the current session. For example:

$ pw group mod u2f -m <user>
$ shutdown -r now

For details, see %%PREFIX%%/etc/devd/u2f.conf
