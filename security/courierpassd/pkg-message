In order to run this port, please add the following line to
/etc/inetd.conf if not already there:

pop3pw stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/courierpassd courierpassd -s imap

"imap" can be replaced with the service you wish to authenticate (and change)
passwords against, eg: "pop3".

After modifying /etc/inetd.conf, you must (as root) run:

	killall -HUP inetd
