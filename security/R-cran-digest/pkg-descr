The digest package provides a function 'digest' for the creation
of hash digests of arbitrary R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256
and crc32 algorithms) permitting easy comparison of R language
objects, as well as a function hmac() to create hash-based message
authentication code. The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified
in RFC 1321, the SHA-1 and SHA-256 algorithms are specified in
FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, and the crc32 algorithm is described in
ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt. For md5,
sha-1 and sha-256, this packages uses small standalone implementations
that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32, code from the
zlib library is used. Please note that this package is not meant
to be deployed for cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive
(and widely tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
