Implementation of a function 'digest()' for the creation of hash
digests of arbitrary R objects (using the md5, sha-1, sha-256,
crc32, xxhash and murmurhash algorithms) permitting easy comparison
of R language objects, as well as a function 'hmac()' to create
hash-based message authentication code. The md5 algorithm by Ron
Rivest is specified in RFC 1321, the sha-1 and sha-256 algorithms
are specified in FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, and the crc32 algorithm
is described in ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt.
For md5, sha-1, sha-256 and aes, this package uses small standalone
implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For crc32,
code from the zlib library is used. For sha-512, an implementation
by Aaron D. Gifford is used. For xxHash, the implementation by Yann
Collet is used. For murmurhash, an implementation by Shane Day is
used. Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for
cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely
tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
