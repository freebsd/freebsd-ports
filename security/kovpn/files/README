Kovpn's configuration steps

First of all, you have to enable OpenVPN's management interface either by 
modifying its configuration file or by adding command line options.

 o Modifying OpenVPN's configurations files:
   + Add these lines to every OpenVPNconfiguration file you have.

  management 127.0.0.1 11194 pwfile.txt
  management-query-passwords
  management-hold

 NOTE: If you have any problems with configuring OpenVPN or if there are 
 obscurities, please take a look at the OpenVPN sample config file.

 o Adding command line options:
   + Set the openvpn_flags on /etc/rc.conf file:

  openvpn_flags="--management 127.0.0.1 11194 pwfile.txt
                 --management-query-passwords
                 --management-hold"

 o Restart OpenVPN server

The next thing you have to do is to configure kovpn itself.
 o Start kovpn
 o right-click on kovpn's icon in the system tray to open the popup menu.
 o left-click on the "Configure kovpn" menu item.
 o Go to the page "OpenVPN" (which should already be on top).
 o Click on the "Add" Button on the right side to add a new OpenVPN connection.
 o Fill in the fields in the "OpenVPN connection" dialog.
   + Name can be choosen freely but must be unique
   + Host must be the hostname you told OpenVPN 
     (the management option in the first step)
   + Port must be the port you told OpenVPN 
     (the management option in the first step)
 o The other options are not important for kovpn to work but can raise your 
   comfort.
 o That's it ! Click on all OKs and you're done.
