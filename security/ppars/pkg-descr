Welcome to the Proactive Abuse Reporting System.

In an effort to be proactive in doing my part to stop the massive 
quantities of internet traffic probing for open ports or more 
specifically the probing for known ports that ms/windows spy ware, 
Trojans, and what ever other ms/windows ports are commonly probed 
which result in increasing my bandwidth usage changes, I wrote this 
perl application for reporting that abuse to the senders ISP, with 
the hopes they will monitor the abuser and terminate the abuser's 
internet account and or take legal action.

Script is installed into /usr/local/sbin where you can edit the 
defaults to meet your requirements. Issue rehash command to enable.
Run abuse.Reporting.system.pl script for complete overview description
of system.
