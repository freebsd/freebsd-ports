Welcome to the Proactive Abuse Reporting System.

In an effort to be proactive in doing my part to stop the massive
quantities of internet traffic probing for open ports or more
specifically the probing for known ports that Windows spy ware,
Trojans, and what ever other Windows ports are commonly probed
which result in increasing my bandwidth usage changes, I wrote this
perl application for reporting that abuse to the senders ISP, with
the hopes they will monitor the abuser and terminate the abuser's
internet account and or take legal action.

Script is installed into /usr/local/sbin where you can edit the
defaults to meet your requirements. Issue rehash command to enable.
Run abuse.Reporting.system.pl script for complete overview description
of system.

domain. It can be copied and distributed for free by anyone to anyone
by any manner.
