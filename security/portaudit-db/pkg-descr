In contrast to security/portaudit, which is designed to be an
install-and-forget solution, portaudit-db requires a current
ports tree and generates a database that can be used locally
or distributed over a network.

Furthermore committers that want to add entries to the VuXML
database may use this port to check their changes locally.
It also features a file `database/portaudit.txt' where UUIDs
for vulnerabilities can be allocated before they have been
investigated thoroughly and moved to the VuXML database by
the security officer team.

Call `packaudit' after upgrading your ports tree.
