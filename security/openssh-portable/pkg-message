To enable this port, add openssh_enable="YES" in your rc.conf. To
prevent conflict with openssh in the base system add sshd_enable="NO"
in your rc.conf. Also you can configure openssh at another TCP port (via
sshd_config 'Port' and 'Listen' options or via 'openssh_flags'
variable in rc.conf) and run it in same time with base sshd.

'PermitRootLogin no' is the default for the OpenSSH port.
This now matches the PermitRootLogin configuration of OpenSSH in
the base system.  Please be aware of this when upgrading your
OpenSSH port, and if truly necessary, re-enable remote root login
by readjusting this option in your sshd_config.

Users are encouraged to create single-purpose users with ssh keys, disable
Password authentication by setting 'PasswordAuthentication no' and
'ChallengeResponseAuthentication no', and to define very narrow sudo
privileges instead of using root for automated tasks.
