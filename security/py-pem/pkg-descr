pem is an MIT-licensed Python module for parsing and splitting of PEM files,
i.e. Base64-encoded DER keys and certificates.

It runs on Python 3.7+, has no dependencies, and does not attempt to interpret
the certificate data in any way.

It's born from the need to load keys, certificates, trust chains, and DH
parameters from various certificate deployments: some servers (like Apache)
expect them to be a separate file, others (like nginx) expect them concatenated
to the server certificate and finally some (like HAProxy) expect key,
certificate, and chain to be in one file.

Additionally to the vanilla parsing code, pem also contains helpers for Twisted
that save a lot of boilerplate code.
