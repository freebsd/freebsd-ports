4.3       Extensions may be created for the use of the Licensee Provided that
if any such Extension is published (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
include sharing such Extension with another Licensee or a third party unless
the party to which the Extension is provided is either a client of the Licensee
and the relevant Extension has been created for use on an engagement for that
or another client of the Licensee, or another Licensee within your
organisation) the Licensee shall notify the Licensor and provide to it a copy
of such Extension and the Licensee agrees that any such Extension shall, at the
option of the Licensor, become either

4.3.1    a Burp App; or

4.3.2    part of the Software.

4.4       When the creation of an Extension is notified to the Licensor or
shared publicly and comes to the attention of the Licensor the Licensor has the
option to make the Extension a Burp App (Burp App, or BApp) after having
carried out the necessary checks to ensure that the Extension is efficacious
and suitable for use with the Software.

4.5       The Licensor has established the BApp Store product feature where
Burp Apps are described and may be downloaded without charge for use as an

Extension has been checked by the Licensor and has been deemed suitable for use
with the Software.

4.7       All Extensions and Burp Apps remain the property of the author but by
creating such Extension, the author has granted an irrevocable perpetual
licence free of charge to the Licensor to incorporate such Extension in the
Software at the Licensor's option and an irrevocable perpetual licence free of
charge to all Licensees who download the Burp App from the BApp Store.

4.8       If, at the sole option of the Licensor, the Licensor incorporates an
Extension into the Software a notice will be placed on the BApp Store to that
effect.

4.9    The Licensor retains the right without incurring any liability to the
Licensee to disable without notice any Burp App being used by the Licensee
where the Licensor considers in its sole discretion that use of such Burp App

contravention of the terms of this Licence, the Licensor will, at its sole
option, either repair or replace the Software, provided that you make available
