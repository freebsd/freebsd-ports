cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic recipes and
primitives to Python developers. Our goal is for it to be your "cryptographic
standard library".

cryptography includes both high level recipes, and low level interfaces to
common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests
and key derivation functions.
