**********************************************************************

In order to start using clamav-unofficial-sigs, you need to configure
it first. Sample configuration files have been installed to:

%%ETCDIR%%

All user configuration changes should go in file "user.conf". Modify
it according to your needs and when you are done set the value of 
"user_configuration_complete" parameter to "yes".

NOTE: Starting with version 5.0.0 configuration has been split into
multiple files, which now reside in:

%%ETCDIR%%

If you had previous version installed, you can remove the old
obsolete configuration file:

%%PREFIX%%/etc/clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf

To run the script periodically by cron, you also need to add it to 
your crontab. Sample crontab and logrotate files are located in:

%%EXAMPLESDIR%%
