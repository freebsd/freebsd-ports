WARNING:
The private keys on the eID cards are created by the Belgian government and
not by the citizens.  You should assume that the government can forge digital
signatures and decrypt encrypted content.

The procfs file system must be mounted on /proc for these libraries to work
correctly.  Add the following line to /etc/fstab and run "mount procfs".

procfs		/proc		procfs	rw		0	0

To use your eID in Firefox you can add libbeidpkcs11.so as a security module:
- Make sure you have installed a pcsc-lite driver for your card reader (such
  as devel/libccid) and that pcscd is running (add pcscd_enable="YES" to
  /etc/rc.conf and start the service by running "service pcscd start").
- Connect your card reader.
- In Firefox go to Edit->Preferences->Advanced->Certificates and press
  "Security Devices", then "Load".
- Enter a name such as "Belgian eID" and browse for libbeidpkcs11.so.  Then
  close the two windows by pressing "OK" twice.
- If all went well you can now plug in your eID card and see your certificates
  listed under "View Certificates->Your Certificates".
