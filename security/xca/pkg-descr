Graphical certification authority is an interface for managing RSA keys
and certificates, and the creation and signing of PKCS#10 requests. It
uses the OpenSSL library and a Berkeley DB for key and certificate
storage. It supports importing and exporting keys and PEM DER PKCS8
certificates, signing and revoking of PEM DER PKCS12, and selection of
x509v3 extensions. A tree view of certificates is presented.
