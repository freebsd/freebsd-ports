Graphical certification authority is an interface for managing 
RSA keys and certificates, and the creation and signing of PKCS#10 requests. 
It uses the OpenSSL library and a Berkeley DB for key and certificate storage. 
It supports importing and exporting keys and PEM DER PKCS8 certificates, 
signing and revoking of PEM DER PKCS12, and selection of x509v3 extensions. 
A tree view of certificates is presented.
