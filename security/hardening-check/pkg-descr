Hardening-check is a perl script to verify that the resulting binary
does, in fact, have hardening features enabled, you can use it to
test each ELF binary and the output will show if the binary has
position independent executable, stack protected, fortify source
functions(not supported on FreeBSD now), read only relocations or
immediate binding supported.
