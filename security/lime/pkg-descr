LIME is an end-to-end encryption library for one-to-one and group
instant messaging, allowing users to exchange messages privately and
asynchronously. It uses modern ciphering curve X448 and double ratchet
algorithm for perfect forward secrecy.

LIME is composed of a portable client library coupled with a public key
server developed by Belledonne Communications to allow end-to-end
encryption for messaging, without having to exchange cryptographic keys
simultaneously.

The library exposes a C, C++, Python and Java API for easy integration
in mobile and desktop environments.

LIME supports multiple devices per user and multiple users per device.
