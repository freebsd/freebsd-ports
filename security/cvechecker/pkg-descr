The goal of cvechecker is to report about possible vulnerabilities on your
system, by scanning a list of installed software and matching results with
the CVE database.

This is not a bullet-proof method and you may have many false positives (ie:
vulnerability is fixed with a revision-release, but the tool isn't able to
detect the revision itself), yet it is still better than nothing, especially
if you are running a distribution with little security coverage.
