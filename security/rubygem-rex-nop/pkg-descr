This library contains the opty2 library for dynamic generation of x86 multi-byte
NOPs. This is useful in writing exploits and encoders. It allows you to dynamic
generate variable length instruction sets that are equivalent to a No Operation
(NOP) without using the actual 0x90 bytecode. The original code was written by
Optyx and spoonm.
