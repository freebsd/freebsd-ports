Acmetool is an easy-to-use command line tool for automatically acquiring
certificates from ACME servers (such as Let's Encrypt).  It is designed
to flexibly integrate into your webserver setup to enable automatic
verification, however, unlike the official Let's Encrypt client, it
doesn't modify your web server configuration.
