There are example scripts in
    %%PREFIX%%/etc/acme
that you can use for renewing and deploying multiple certificates

In order to run the script regularly to update
the certificates add this line to /etc/periodic.conf

    weekly_acme_client_enable="YES"

Additionally the following parameters can be added to
/etc/periodic.conf (showing default values):

To specify the domain name(s) to include in the certificate
    weekly_acme_client_domains="$(hostname -f)"

To specify the .well-known/acme-challenge directory (full path)
    weekly_acme_client_challengedir="%%WWWDIR%%"

To set additional acme-client arguments (see acme-client(1))
    weekly_acme_client_args="-b"

To run a specific script for the renewal (ignore previously set variables)
allows generating/renewing multiple keys/certificates
    weekly_acme_client_renewscript=""%%PREFIX%%/etc/acme/%%PORTNAME%%.sh"

To run a script after the renewal to deploy changed certs
    weekly_acme_client_deployscript="%%PREFIX%%/etc/acme/deploy.sh"
