OpenIKED is a lean Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) daemon which performs
mutual authentication and which establishes and maintains IPsec VPN
flows and security associations (SAs) between the two peers.

This version of OpenIKED is derived from OpenIKED's iked, but changed
to support transport mode IPSec and lazy creation of associations,
among many other improvements.
