Under some circumstances simple wrapper around OpenSSH ssh command-line
utility seems more preferable than paramiko machinery.

This project proposes yet another hopefully thin wrapper around ssh to
execute commands on remote servers. All you need thereis to make sure that
OpenSSH client and Python interpreter are installed, and then install
openssh-wrapper package.
