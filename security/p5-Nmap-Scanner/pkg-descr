This set of modules provides perl class wrappers for the network mapper
(nmap) scanning tool (see http://www.insecure.org/nmap/).  Using these
modules, a developer, network administrator, or other techie can create
perl routines or classes which can be used to automate and integrate
nmap scans elegantly into new and existing perl scripts.
