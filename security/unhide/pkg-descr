Unhide is a forensic tool to find hidden processes and TCP/UDP ports by
rootkits / LKMs or by another hidden technique. It consists of two
programs: unhide and unhide-tcp.

unhide detects hidden processes through:
   * Comparison of /proc vs /bin/ps output.
   * Comparison of info gathered from /bin/ps with info gathered from.
   * Syscalls (syscall scanning).
   * Full PIDs space ocupation (PIDs bruteforcing).

unhide-tcp identifies TCP/UDP ports that are listening but not listed in
/bin/netstat by doing brute forcing of all TCP/UDP ports availables.
