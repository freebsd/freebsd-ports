Chaosreader is a perl script that parses snoop or tcpdump logs
and extracts sessions for a number of different appplications:
ssh, telnet, smtp, irc, ftp, etc.  The data are formatted into
an html file and can be used to replay some sessions.

Sshkeydata is a perl script that attempts to recreate ssh
sessions extracted by chaosreader by estimating what commands
may have been typed.

Both scripts are installed in ${PREFIX}/bin
