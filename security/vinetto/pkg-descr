Vinetto extracts the thumbnails and associated metadata from the Thumbs.db
files.

The Windows systems (98, ME, 2000, XP and 2003 Server) can store thumbnails
and metadata of the picture files contained in the directories of its FAT32
or NTFS filesystems.

The thumbnails and associated metadata are stored in Thumbs.db files.
The Thumbs.db files are undocumented OLE structured files.

Once a picture file has been deleted from the filesystem, the related thumbnail
and associated metada remain stored in the Thumbs.db file. So, the data
contained in those Thumbs.db files are an helpful source of information
for the forensics investigator.
