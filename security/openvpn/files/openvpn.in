# PROVIDE: openvpn
# REQUIRE: DAEMON
# KEYWORD: shutdown

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This script supports running multiple instances of openvpn.
# To run additional instances link this script to something like
# % ln -s openvpn openvpn_foo
# and define additional openvpn_foo_* variables in one of
# /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf.d/openvpn_foo
#
# Below NAME should be substituted with the name of this script. By default
# it is openvpn, so read as openvpn_enable. If you linked the script to
# openvpn_foo, then read as openvpn_foo_enable etc.
#
# The following variables are supported (defaults are shown).
# You can place them in any of
# /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf.d/NAME
#
# NAME_enable="NO"	# set to YES to enable openvpn
# NAME_if=		# driver(s) to load, set to "tun", "tap" or "tun tap"
#			# it is OK to specify the if_ prefix.
#
# # optional:
# NAME_flags=				# additional command line arguments
# NAME_configfile="%%PREFIX%%/etc/openvpn/NAME.conf"	# --config file
# NAME_dir="%%PREFIX%%/etc/openvpn"	# --cd directory
#
# You also need to set NAME_configfile and NAME_dir, if the configuration
# file and directory where keys and certificates reside differ from the above
# settings.
#
# Note that we deliberately refrain from unloading drivers.
#
# For further documentation, please see openvpn(8).
