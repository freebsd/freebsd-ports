Note that "Tunnelblick" is a controversial option.
It is included for compatibility, not enabled by default,
and should only be used with due consideration, and it should not
replace proper cryptography use in OpenVPN.

Note that this patch does NOT add documentation for the new --scramble
option, neither to the --help output, nor the manual page.
