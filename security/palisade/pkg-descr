PALISADE is a general lattice cryptography library that currently includes
efficient implementations of the following lattice cryptography capabilities:

* Homomorphic Encryption (HE): Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (3 variants),
  Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan, and Stehle-Steinfeld schemes
* Proxy Re-Encryption for all HE schemes
* Digital Signature
* Identity-Based Encryption
* Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption
