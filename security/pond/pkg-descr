Pond is not email. Pond is forward secure, asynchronous messaging for the
discerning. Pond messages are asynchronous, but are not a record; they expire
automatically a week after they are received. Pond seeks to prevent leaking
traffic information against everyone except a global passive attacker.

Pond is experimental software! DO NOT USE IT FOR ANYTHING REAL!!!
Use security/gnupg instead.
