This is a library for verifying YubiKey OTP tokens. It includes both the
low-level implementation for verifying tokens locally and clients for multiple
versions of the Yubico validation web service. The primary audience is
developers who wish to verify YubiKey tokens in their applications, presumably
as part of a multi-factor authentication scheme.
