CPANSA::DB provides the CPAN Security Advisory data as a Perl data structure,
mostly for CPAN::Audit.

The db subroutine returns the CPAN Security Advisory (CPANSA) reports as a Perl
data structure. However, anything can use this.

Each release also comes with a .gpg file that has the signature for the file. If
you cannot confirm that the module file has the right signature, it might have
been corrupted or modified.

This module is available outside of CPAN as a release on GitHub:
https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory/releases. Each release on
GitHub includes an attestation.

There is also a JSON file that provides the same datastructure.
