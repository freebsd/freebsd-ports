Sqlninja is a tool targeted to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities on
a web application that uses Microsoft SQL Server as its back-end.

Its main goal is to provide a remote shell on the vulnerable DB server,
even in a very hostile environment. It should be used by penetration
testers to help and automate the process of taking over a DB Server when
a SQL Injection vulnerability has been discovered.
