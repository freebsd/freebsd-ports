  message: <<EOM
Edit /etc/rc.conf[.local] to start OpenVPN automatically at system
startup. See %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/openvpn for details.

Connect to VPN server as a client with this command to include
the client.up/down scripts in the initialization:
openvpn-client <spec>.ovpn

For compatibility notes when interoperating with older OpenVPN
versions, please see <http://openvpn.net/relnotes.html>

Note that OpenVPN does not officially support LibreSSL.

Note that OpenVPN configures a separate user and group "openvpn",
which should be used instead of the NFS user "nobody"
when an unprivileged user account is desired.

You may want to add user openvpn and group openvpn when creating your
configuration files, the example configuration shows this only as comments.
