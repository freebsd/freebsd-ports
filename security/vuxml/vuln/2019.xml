	<blockquote cite="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16782">
	  <p>There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in
	    Rack (RubyGem rack). This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12
	    and 2.0.8. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using
	    timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored
	    and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up
	    lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time
	    it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid
	    session id and hijack the session. The session id itself may be
	    generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing
	    store does not use a secure comparison.</p>

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<p>Typo3 core team reports:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://typo3.org/article/typo3-10-2-1-9-5-12-and-8-7-30-security-releases-published">
	  <p>It has been discovered that the output of field validation errors in the Form Framework is vulnerable
	    to cross-site scripting.</p>
	  <p>It has been discovered that t3:// URL handling and typolink functionality are vulnerable to cross-site
	    scripting. Not only regular backend forms are affected but also frontend extensions which use the rendering
	    with typolink.</p>
	  <p>It has been discovered that the output table listing in the Files backend module is vulnerable to cross-site
	    scripting when a file extension contains malicious sequences. Access to the file system of the server - either
	    directly or through synchronization - is required to exploit the vulnerability.</p>
	  <p>It has been discovered that the extraction of manually uploaded ZIP archives in Extension Manager is vulnerable
	    to directory traversal. Admin privileges are required in order to exploit this vulnerability. Since TYPO3 v9 LTS,
	    System Maintainer privileges are required as well.</p>
	  <p>Failing to properly escape user submitted content, class QueryGenerator is vulnerable to SQL injection.
	    Having system extension ext:lowlevel installed and a valid backend user having administrator privileges are
	    required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
	  <p>It has been discovered that classes QueryGenerator and QueryView are vulnerable to insecure deserialization.
	    Requirements for successfully exploiting this vulnerability (one of the following):
	    - having system extension ext:lowlevel (Backend Module: DB Check) installed and valid backend user having
	    administrator privileges
	    - having system extension ext:sys_action installed and valid backend user having limited privileges</p>
	  <p>TYPO3 allows to upload files either in the backend user interface as well as in custom developed extensions.
	    To reduce the possibility to upload potential malicious code TYPO3 uses the fileDenyPattern to deny e.g. user
	    submitted PHP scripts from being persisted. Besides that it is possible for any editor to upload file assets
	    using the file module (fileadmin) or changing their avatar image shown in the TYPO3 backend.

	    Per default TYPO3 allows to upload and store HTML and SVG files as well using the mentioned functionalities.
	    Custom extension implementations probably would also accept those files when only the fileDenyPattern is evaluated.

	    Since HTML and SVG files - which might contain executable JavaScript code per W3C standard - could be directly
	    displayed in web clients, the whole web application is exposed to be vulnerable concerning Cross-Site Scripting.
	    Currently the following scenarios are known - given an authenticated regular editor is able to upload files using
	    the TYPO3 backend:
	    - directly target a potential victim to a known public resource in a URL, e.g. /fileadmin/malicious.svg or
	    /fileadmin/malicious.html
	    - using the TypoScript content object “SVG” (implemented in class ScalableVectorGraphicsContentObject)
	    having renderMode set to inline for SVG files (available since TYPO3 v9.0)
	    - custom implementations that directly output and render markup of HTML and SVG files

	    SVG files that are embedded using an img src=”malicious.svg” tag are not vulnerable since potential
	    scripts are not executed in these scenarios (see https://www.w3.org/wiki/SVG_Security). The icon API of TYPO3
	    is not scope of this announcement since SVG icons need to be registered using an individual implementation,
	      which is not considered as user submitted content.</p>
	    <p>It has been discovered that request handling in Extbase can be vulnerable to insecure deserialization.
	      User submitted payload has to be signed with a corresponding HMAC-SHA1 using the sensitive TYPO3 encryptionKey
	      as secret - invalid or unsigned payload is not deserialized.

	      However, since sensitive information could have been leaked by accident (e.g. in repositories or in commonly
	      known and unprotected backup files), there is the possibility that attackers know the private encryptionKey
	      and are able to calculate the required HMAC-SHA1 to allow a malicious payload to be deserialized.

	      Requirements for successfully exploiting this vulnerability (all of the following):
	      - rendering at least one Extbase plugin in the frontend
	      - encryptionKey has been leaked (from LocalConfiguration.php or corresponding .env file). </p>

	  <p>CVE-2019-19118: Privilege escalation in the Django admin.</p>
	  <p>Since Django 2.1, a Django model admin displaying a parent model with related
	    model inlines, where the user has view-only permissions to a parent model but
	    edit permissions to the inline model, would display a read-only view of the parent
	    model but editable forms for the inline.</p>
	  <p>Submitting these forms would not allow direct edits to the parent model, but would
	    trigger the parent model's save() method, and cause pre and post-save signal handlers
	    to be invoked. This is a privilege escalation as a user who lacks permission to edit
	    a model should not be able to trigger its save-related signals.</p>

	  <p>urllib3 before version 1.23 does not remove the Authorization HTTP header when following a cross-origin redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs in host, port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the Authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or transmitted in cleartext.</p>
	  <p>In the urllib3 library through 1.24.1 for Python, CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls the request parameter.</p>
	  <p>The urllib3 library before 1.24.2 for Python mishandles certain cases where the desired set of CA certificates is different from the OS store of CA certificates, which results in SSL connections succeeding in situations where a verification failure is the correct outcome. This is related to use of the ssl_context, ca_certs, or ca_certs_dir argument.</p>

	<h1>Problem Description:</h1>
	<p>The kernel driver for /dev/midistat implements a handler
	for read(2). This handler is not thread-safe, and a
	multi-threaded program can exploit races in the handler to
	cause it to copy out kernel memory outside the boundaries
	of midistat's data buffer.</p>
	<h1>Impact:</h1>
	<p>The races allow a program to read kernel memory within
	a 4GB window centered at midistat's data buffer. The buffer
	is allocated each time the device is opened, so an attacker
	is not limited to a static 4GB region of memory.</p>
	<p>On 32-bit platforms, an attempt to trigger the race may
	cause a page fault in kernel mode, leading to a panic.</p>

	<p>curl security problems:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html">
	  <p>CVE-2019-5481: FTP-KRB double-free</p>
	  <p>libcurl can be told to use kerberos over FTP to a server, as set with
	    the CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL option.</p>
	  <p>During such kerberos FTP data transfer, the server sends data to curl
	    in blocks with the 32 bit size of each block first and then that amount
	    of data immediately following.</p>
	  <p>A malicious or just broken server can claim to send a very large block
	    and if by doing that it makes curl's subsequent call to realloc() to
	    fail, curl would then misbehave in the exit path and double-free the
	    memory.</p>
	  <p>In practical terms, an up to 4 GB memory area may very well be fine to
	    allocate on a modern 64 bit system but on 32 bit systems it will fail.</p>
	  <p>Kerberos FTP is a rarely used protocol with curl. Also, Kerberos
	    authentication is usually only attempted and used with servers that the
	    client has a previous association with.</p>
	  <p>CVE-2019-5482: TFTP small blocksize heap buffer overflow</p>
	  <p>libcurl contains a heap buffer overflow in the function
	    (tftp_receive_packet()) that receives data from a TFTP server. It can
	    call recvfrom() with the default size for the buffer rather than with
	    the size that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that might
	    overwrite the heap memory is controlled by the server.</p>
	  <p>This flaw is only triggered if the TFTP server sends an OACK without
	    the BLKSIZE option, when a BLKSIZE smaller than 512 bytes was requested
	    by the TFTP client. OACK is a TFTP extension and is not used by all
	    TFTP servers.</p>
	  <p>Users choosing a smaller block size than default should be rare as the
	    primary use case for changing the size is to make it larger.</p>
	  <p>It is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most
	    commonly used within local networks. TFTP as a protocol is always
	    inherently insecure.</p>
	  <p>This issue was introduced by the add of the TFTP BLKSIZE option
	    handling. It was previously incompletely fixed by an almost identical
	    issue called CVE-2019-5436.</p>

	<p>The Asterisk project reports:</p>
	<blockquote cite="http://www.asterisk.org/downloads/security-advisories">
	  <p>When audio frames are given to the audio transcoding
	  support in Asterisk the number of samples are examined
	  and as part of this a message is output to indicate that
	  no samples are present. A change was done to suppress
	  this message for a particular scenario in which the message
	  was not relevant. This change assumed that information
	  about the origin of a frame will always exist when in
	  reality it may not.</p>
	  <p>This issue presented itself when an RTP packet containing
	  no audio (and thus no samples) was received. In a particular
	  transcoding scenario this audio frame would get turned
	  into a frame with no origin information. If this new frame
	  was then given to the audio transcoding support a crash
	  would occur as no samples and no origin information would
	  be present. The transcoding scenario requires the genericplc
	  option to be set to enabled (the default) and a transcoding
	  path from the source format into signed linear and then
	  from signed linear into another format.</p>
	  <p>Note that there may be other scenarios that have not
	  been found which can cause an audio frame with no origin
	  to be given to the audio transcoding support and thus
	  cause a crash.</p>

	  <p>Vulnerability Details:

IMAP and ManageSieve protocol parsers do not properly handle NUL byte
when scanning data in quoted strings, leading to out of bounds heap
memory writes.

Risk:

This vulnerability allows for out-of-bounds writes to objects stored on
the heap up to 8096 bytes in pre-login phase, and 65536 bytes post-login
phase, allowing sufficiently skilled attacker to perform complicated
attacks that can lead to leaking private information or remote code
execution. Abuse of this bug is very difficult to observe, as it does
not necessarily cause a crash. Attempts to abuse this bug are not
directly evident from logs.

  <p>Node.js reports:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/aug-2019-security-releases/">
    <p>Node.js, as well as many other implementations of HTTP/2, have been found vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks. See https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-002.md for more information.</p>
    <p>Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines, including Linux ARMv6 builds for Node.js 8.x (which had been delayed).</p>
    <p>We recommend that all Node.js users upgrade to a version listed below as soon as possible.</p>
    <h1>Vulnerabilities Fixed</h1>
    <p>Impact: All versions of Node.js 8 (LTS "Carbon"), Node.js 10 (LTS "Dubnium"), and Node.js 12 (Current) are vulnerable to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CVE-2019-9511 "Data Dribble": The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.</li>
      <li>CVE-2019-9512 "Ping Flood": The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.</li>
      <li>CVE-2019-9513 "Resource Loop": The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service.</li>
      <li>CVE-2019-9514 "Reset Flood": The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.</li>
      <li>CVE-2019-9515 "Settings Flood": The attacker sends a stream of SETTINGS frames to the peer. Since the RFC requires that the peer reply with one acknowledgement per SETTINGS frame, an empty SETTINGS frame is almost equivalent in behavior to a ping. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.</li>
      <li>CVE-2019-9516 "0-Length Headers Leak": The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory, potentially leading to a denial of service.</li>
      <li>CVE-2019-9517 "Internal Data Buffering": The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.</li>
      <li>CVE-2019-9518 "Empty Frames Flood": The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service. (Discovered by Piotr Sikora of Google)</li>

	<blockquote cite="https://virtualmin.com/node/66890">
	  <p>I've rolled out Webmin version 1.930 and Usermin version 1.780
	  for all repositories. This release includes several security
	  fixes, including one potentially serious one caused by malicious
	  code inserted into Webmin and Usermin at some point on our build
	  infrastructure. We're still investigating how and when, but the
	  exploitable code has never existed in our github repositories, so
	  we've rebuilt from git source on new infrastructure (and checked
	  to be sure the result does not contain the malicious code).</p>

	  <p>I don't have a changelog for these releases yet, but I wanted
	  to announce them immediately due to the severity of this issue.
	  To exploit the malicious code, your Webmin installation must have

	  <p>CVE-2019-9511 "Data Dribble": The attacker requests a large amount of
	    data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate
	    window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in
	    1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this
	    can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a

	  <p>CVE-2019-9513 "Ping Flood": The attacker sends continual pings to an

	  <p>
	    Given a suitable `SECURITY DEFINER` function, an attacker can execute arbitrary
	    SQL under the identity of the function owner.  An attack requires `EXECUTE`
	    permission on the function, which must itself contain a function call having
	    inexact argument type match.  For example, `length('foo'::varchar)` and
	    `length('foo')` are inexact, while `length('foo'::text)` is exact.
	    As part of exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker uses `CREATE DOMAIN`
	    to create a type in a `pg_temp` schema. The attack pattern and fix are similar
	    to that for CVE-2007-2138.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Writing `SECURITY DEFINER` functions continues to require following
	    the considerations noted in the documentation:

	  <p>
	    In a database containing hypothetical, user-defined hash equality operators,
	    an attacker could read arbitrary bytes of server memory. For an attack to
	    become possible, a superuser would need to create unusual operators.
	    It is possible for operators not purpose-crafted for attack to have
	    the properties that enable an attack, but we are not aware of specific examples.

	  <p>CVE-2019-14232: Denial-of-service possibility in
	    django.utils.text.Truncator</p>
	  <p>If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were
	    passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate
	    certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a
	    regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to
	    implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template
	    filters, which were thus vulnerable</p>
	  <p>The regular expressions used by Truncator have been simplified in
	    order to avoid potential backtracking issues. As a consequence, trailing
	    punctuation may now at times be included in the truncated output.</p>
	  <p>CVE-2019-14233: Denial-of-service possibility in strip_tags()</p>
	  <p>Due to the behavior of the underlying HTMLParser,
	    django.utils.html.strip_tags() would be extremely slow to evaluate
	    certain inputs containing large sequences of nested incomplete HTML
	    entities. The strip_tags() method is used to implement the corresponding
	    striptags template filter, which was thus also vulnerable.</p>
	  <p>strip_tags() now avoids recursive calls to HTMLParser when progress
	    removing tags, but necessarily incomplete HTML entities, stops being
	    made.</p>
	  <p>Remember that absolutely NO guarantee is provided about the results of
	    strip_tags() being HTML safe. So NEVER mark safe the result of a
	    strip_tags() call without escaping it first, for example with
	    django.utils.html.escape().</p>
	  <p>CVE-2019-14234: SQL injection possibility in key and index lookups for
	    JSONField/HStoreField</p>
	  <p>Key and index lookups for JSONField and key lookups for HStoreField
	    were subject to SQL injection, using a suitably crafted dictionary,
	    with dictionary expansion, as the **kwargs passed to QuerySet.filter().</p>
	  <p>CVE-2019-14235: Potential memory exhaustion in
	    django.utils.encoding.uri_to_iri()</p>
	  <p>If passed certain inputs, django.utils.encoding.uri_to_iri() could lead
	    to significant memory usage due to excessive recursion when
	    re-percent-encoding invalid UTF-8 octet sequences.</p>
	  <p>uri_to_iri() now avoids recursion when re-percent-encoding invalid
	    UTF-8 octet sequences.</p>

	<h1>Problem Description:</h1>
	<p>While processing acknowledgements, the RACK code uses
	several linked lists to maintain state entries. A malicious
	attacker can cause the lists to grow unbounded. This can
	cause an expensive list traversal on every packet being
	processed, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of
	service.</p>
	<h1>Impact:</h1>
	<p>An attacker with the ability to send specially crafted
	TCP traffic to a victim system can degrade network performance
	and/or consume excessive CPU by exploiting the inefficiency
	of traversing the potentially very large RACK linked lists
	with relatively small bandwidth cost.</p>

	<blockquote cite="https://lists.tartarus.org/pipermail/putty-announce/2019/000028.html">
	  <p>Vulnerabilities fixed in this release include:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>A malicious SSH-1 server could trigger a buffer overrun by sending
	      extremely short RSA keys, or certain bad packet length fields.
	      Either of these could happen before host key verification, so even
	      if you trust the server you *intended* to connect to, you would
	      still be at risk.
	    <br/>
	      (However, the SSH-1 protocol is obsolete, and recent versions of
	      PuTTY do not try it by default, so you are only at risk if you work
	      with old servers and have explicitly configured SSH-1.)</li>
	    <li>If a malicious process found a way to impersonate Pageant, then it
	      could cause an integer overflow in any of the SSH client tools
	      (PuTTY, Plink, PSCP, PSFTP) which accessed the malicious Pageant.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Other security-related bug fixes include:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The 'trust sigil' system introduced in PuTTY 0.71 to protect
	      against server spoofing attacks had multiple bugs. Trust sigils
	      were not turned off after login in the SSH-1 and Rlogin protocols,
	      and not turned back on if you used the Restart Session command.
	      Both are now fixed.</li>

	  <p>
	    An authenticated user could create a stack-based buffer overflow
	    by changing their own password to a purpose-crafted value. In addition
	    to the ability to crash the PostgreSQL server, this could be further
	    exploited to execute arbitrary code as the PostgreSQL operating system account.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Additionally, a rogue server could send a specifically crafted
	    message during the SCRAM authentication process and cause a libpq-enabled client
	    to either crash or execute arbitrary code as the client's operating system account.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This issue is fixed by upgrading and restarting your PostgreSQL
	    server as well as your libpq installations. All users running
	    PostgreSQL 10, 11, and 12 beta are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.

	  <h3>Summary</h3>
	  <p>CSRF vulnerability in login form</p>

	  <h3>Description</h3>
	  <p>A vulnerability was found that allows an attacker to
	    trigger a CSRF attack against a phpMyAdmin user. The
	    attacker can trick the user, for instance through a broken
	    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag pointing at the victim's
	    phpMyAdmin database, and the attacker can potentially
	    deliver a payload (such as a specific INSERT or DELETE
	    statement) through the victim.</p>

	  <h3>Severity</h3>
	  <p>We consider this vulnerability to be severe.</p>


	  <h3>Mitigation factor</h3> <p>Only the 'cookie'
	    auth_type is affected; users can temporary use
	    phpMyAdmin's http authentication as a workaround.</p>

	  <p>The following Denial of Service vulnerabilities are addressed:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Integer type mismatches in BinPAC-generated parser code
	  and Bro analyzer code may allow for crafted packet data
	  to cause unintentional code paths in the analysis logic
	  to be taken due to unsafe integer conversions causing the
	  parser and analysis logic to each expect different fields
	  to have been parsed.  One such example, reported by Maksim
	  Shudrak, causes the Kerberos analyzer to dereference a
	  null pointer.  CVE-2019-12175 was assigned for this issue.</li>

	  <li>The Kerberos parser allows for several fields to be left
	  uninitialized, but they were not marked with an &amp;optional
	  attribute and several usages lacked existence checks.
	  Crafted packet data could potentially cause an attempt
	  to access such uninitialized fields, generate a runtime
	  error/exception, and leak memory.  Existence checks and
	  &amp;optional attributes have been added to the relevent
	  Kerberos fields.</li>

	  <li>BinPAC-generated protocol parsers commonly contain fields
	  whose length is derived from other packet input, and for
	  those that allow for incremental parsing, BinPAC did not
	  impose a limit on how large such a field could grow,
	  allowing for remotely-controlled packet data to cause
	  growth of BinPAC's flowbuffer bounded only by the numeric
	  limit of an unsigned 64-bit integer, leading to memory
	  exhaustion.  There is now a generalized limit for how
	  large flowbuffers are allowed to grow, tunable by setting
	  "BinPAC::flowbuffer_capacity_max".</li>

	  <p>CVE-2019-5435: Integer overflows in curl_url_set()</p>
	  <p>libcurl contains two integer overflows in the curl_url_set()
	    function that if triggered, can lead to a too small buffer
	    allocation and a subsequent heap buffer overflow.</p>
	  <p>The flaws only exist on 32 bit architectures and require
	    excessive string input lengths.</p>
	  <p>CVE-2019-5436: TFTP receive buffer overflow</p>
	  <p>libcurl contains a heap buffer overflow in the function
	    (tftp_receive_packet()) that recevives data from a TFTP server. It
	    calls recvfrom() with the default size for the buffer rather than
	    with the size that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that
	    might overwrite the heap memory is entirely controlled by the server.</p>
	  <p>The flaw exists if the user selects to use a "blksize" of 504 or
	    smaller (default is 512). The smaller size that is used, the larger
	    the possible overflow becomes.</p>
	  <p>Users chosing a smaller size than default should be rare as the
	    primary use case for changing the size is to make it larger.</p>
	  <p>It is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most
	    commonly used within local networks.</p>

	    The Rust Programming Language Standard Library 1.34.x
	    before 1.34.2 contains a stabilized method which, if
	    overridden, can violate Rust's safety guarantees and
	    cause memory unsafety.  If the Error::type_id method
	    is overridden then any type can be safely cast to any
	    other type, causing memory safety vulnerabilities in
	    safe code (e.g., out-of-bounds write or read).  Code
	    that does not manually implement Error::type_id is

	    PostgreSQL maintains statistics for tables by sampling

	    able to execute SQL queries with permissions to read a

	    could effectively bypass the policy. This is fixed by only

	<blockquote cite="https://blog.jupyter.org/open-redirect-vulnerability-in-jupyter-jupyterhub-adf43583f1e4">
	  <p>Login pages tend to take a parameter for redirecting back to a page
	    after successful login, e.g. /login?next=/notebooks/mynotebook.ipynb, so
	    that you aren't disrupted too much if you try to visit a page, but have
	    to authenticate first. An Open Redirect Vulnerability is when a
	    malicious person crafts a link pointing to the login page of a trusted
	    site, but setting the "redirect after successful login" parameter to
	    send the user to their own site, instead of a page on the authenticated
	    site (the notebook or JupyterHub server), e.g.
	    /login?next=http://badwebsite.biz. This doesn't necessarily compromise
	    anything immediately, but it enables phishing if users don't notice
	    that the domain has changed, e.g. by showing a fake "re-enter your
	    password" page. Servers generally have to validate the redirect URL to
	    avoid this. Both JupyterHub and Notebook already do this, but the
	    validation didn't take into account all possible ways to redirect to
	    other sites, so some malicious URLs could still be crafted to redirect
	    away from the server (the above example does not work in any recent
	    version of either package). Only certain browsers (Chrome and Firefox,
	    not Safari) could be redirected from the JupyterHub login page, but all
	    browsers could be redirected away from a standalone notebook server.</p>

	  <p>Vulnerability Details:
When reading FTS or POP3-UIDL header from dovecot index, the input
buffer size is not bound, and data is copied to target structure causing
stack overflow.

Risk:
This can be used for local root privilege escalation or executing
arbitrary code in dovecot process context. This requires ability to
directly modify dovecot indexes.
Steps to reproduce:
Produce dovecot.index.log entry that creates an FTS header which has
more than 12 bytes of data.
Trigger dovecot indexer-worker or run doveadm index.
Dovecot will crash.

Mitigations:
Since 2.3.0 dovecot has been compiled with stack smash protection, ASLR,
read-only GOT tables and other techniques that make exploiting this bug
much harder.</p>

	  <p>5.7.6 contains a security fix for a cross-site inclusion (XSSI)
	    vulnerability, where files at a known URL could be included in a page
	    from an unauthorized website if the user is logged into a Jupyter
	    server. The fix involves setting the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

	    to GET requests to API endpoints and the /files/ endpoint.</p>
	  <p>The attacking page is able to access some contents of files when using
	    Internet Explorer through script errors, but this has not been
	    demonstrated with other browsers. A CVE has been requested for this

	<p>Node.js reports:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2019-security-releases/">
	  <p>Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines. In addition to fixes for security flaws in Node.js, they also include upgrades of Node.js 6 and 8 to OpenSSL 1.0.2r which contains a fix for a moderate severity security vulnerability.</p>
	  <p>For these releases, we have decided to withhold the fix for the Misinterpretation of Input (CWE-115) flaw mentioned in the original announcement. This flaw is very low severity and we are not satisfied that we had a complete and stable fix ready for release. We will be seeking to address this flaw via alternate mechanisms in the near future. In addition, we have introduced an additional CVE for a change in Node.js 6 that we have decided to classify as a Denial of Service (CWE-400) flaw.</p>
	  <p>We recommend that all Node.js users upgrade to a version listed below as soon as possible.</p>
	  <h1>OpenSSL: 0-byte record padding oracle (CVE-2019-1559)</h1>
	  <p>OpenSSL 1.0.2r contains a fix for CVE-2019-1559 and is included in the releases for Node.js versions 6 and 8 only. Node.js 10 and 11 are not impacted by this vulnerability as they use newer versions of OpenSSL which do not contain the flaw.</p>
	  <p>Under certain circumstances, a TLS server can be forced to respond differently to a client if a zero-byte record is received with an invalid padding compared to a zero-byte record with an invalid MAC. This can be used as the basis of a padding oracle attack to decrypt data.</p>
	  <p>Only TLS connections using certain ciphersuites executing under certain conditions are exploitable. We are currently unable to determine whether the use of OpenSSL in Node.js exposes this vulnerability. We are taking a cautionary approach and recommend the same for users. For more information, see the advisory and a detailed write-up by the reporters of the vulnerability.</p>

	<h1>Problem Description:</h1>
	<p>FreeBSD 12.0 attempts to handle the case where the
	receiving process does not provide a sufficiently large
	buffer for an incoming control message containing rights.
	In particular, to avoid leaking the corresponding descriptors
	into the receiving process' descriptor table, the kernel
	handles the truncation case by closing descriptors referenced
	by the discarded message.</p>
	<p>The code which performs this operation failed to release
	a reference obtained on the file corresponding to a received
	right. This bug can be used to cause the reference counter
	to wrap around and free the file structure.</p>
	<h1>Impact:</h1>
	<p>A local user can exploit the bug to gain root privileges
	or escape from a jail.</p>

	  <p>The function handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages
	    (lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target) does not validate incoming
	    data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability.</p>
	  <p>Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick

	  <p>CVE-2019-3822: NTLMv2 type-3 header stack buffer overflow</p>
	  <p>libcurl contains a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability.</p>
	  <p>The function creating an outgoing NTLM type-3 header
	    (lib/vauth/ntlm.c:Curl_auth_create_ntlm_type3_message()), generates the
	    request HTTP header contents based on previously received data. The
	    check that exists to prevent the local buffer from getting overflowed is
	    implemented wrongly (using unsigned math) and as such it does not
	    prevent the overflow from happening.</p>
	  <p>This output data can grow larger than the local buffer if very large
	    "nt response" data is extracted from a previous NTLMv2 header provided
	    by the malicious or broken HTTP server.</p>
	  <p>Such a "large value" needs to be around 1000 bytes or more. The actual
	    payload data copied to the target buffer comes from the NTLMv2 type-2
	    response header.</p>
	  <p>CVE-2019-3823: SMTP end-of-response out-of-bounds read</p>
	  <p>libcurl contains a heap out-of-bounds read in the code handling the
	    end-of-response for SMTP.</p>
	  <p>If the buffer passed to smtp_endofresp() isn't NUL terminated and
	    contains no character ending the parsed number, and len is set to 5,
	    then the strtol() call reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read
	    contents will not be returned to the caller.</p>

	<p>Aki Tuomi (Open-Xchange  Oy) reports:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.mail-archive.com/dovecot@dovecot.org/msg76117.html">
	  <p>Normally Dovecot is configured to authenticate
imap/pop3/managesieve/submission clients using regular username/password
combination. Some installations have also required clients to present a
trusted SSL certificate on top of that. It's also possible to configure
Dovecot to take the username from the certificate instead of from the
user provided authentication. It's also possible to avoid having a
password at all, only trusting the SSL certificate.

If the provided trusted SSL certificate is missing the username field,
Dovecot should be failing the authentication. However, the earlier
versions will take the username from the user provided authentication
fields (e.g. LOGIN command). If there is no additional password
verification, this allows the attacker to login as anyone else in the
system.

This affects only installations using:

auth_ssl_require_client_cert = yes
auth_ssl_username_from_cert = yes

Attacker must also have access to a valid trusted certificate without
the ssl_cert_username_field in it. The default is commonName, which
almost certainly exists in all certificates. This could happen for
example if ssl_cert_username_field is a field that normally doesn't
exist, and attacker has access to a web server's certificate (and key),
which is signed with the same CA.

Attack can be migitated by having the certificates with proper Extended
Key Usage, such as 'TLS Web Server' and 'TLS Web Server Client'.

Also, ssl_cert_username_field setting was ignored with external SMTP
AUTH, because none of the MTAs (Postfix, Exim) currently send the
cert_username field. This may have allowed users with trusted
certificate to specify any username in the authentication. This does not
apply to Dovecot Submission service.</p>

	  <h3>Description</h3>
	  <p>When <code>AllowArbitraryServer</code> configuration set
	    to <code>true</code>, with the use of a rogue MySQL server,
	    an attacker can read any file on the server that the web
	    server's user can access.</p>
	  <p>phpMyadmin attempts to block the use of <code>LOAD DATA
	    INFILE</code>, but due to a <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77496">bug in PHP</a>,
	    this check is not honored. Additionally, when using the
	    'mysql' extension, <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mysql.configuration.php#ini.mysql.allow-local-infile">mysql.allow_local_infile</a>
