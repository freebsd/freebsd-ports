MUNGE (MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium) is an authentication service for creating and
validating credentials. It is designed to be highly scalable for use in an HPC
cluster environment. It allows a process to authenticate the UID and GID of
another local or remote process within a group of hosts having common users and
groups. These hosts form a security realm that is defined by a shared
cryptographic key. Clients within this security realm can create and validate
credentials without the use of root privileges, reserved ports, or
platform-specific methods.
