Prelude is a Universal "Security Information & Event Management" (SIEM)
system.  Prelude collects, normalizes, sorts, aggregates, correlates and
reports all security-related events.

As well as being capable of recovering any type of log (system logs, syslog,
flat files, etc.), Prelude benefits from a native support with a number of
systems dedicated to enriching information even further (snort, samhain,
ossec, auditd, etc.).

This library provides a framework for easy access to the Prelude database.
