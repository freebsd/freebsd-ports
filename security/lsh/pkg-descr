lsh is a client that can connect to the corresponding lshd server.  It uses
the SECSH protocol, which means that it is compatible with SSH 2.0, except
for file transfer, which is not part of SECSH.

SECSH uses compression and encryption algorithms that are unencumbered, and
lsh itself is GPL.

lsh is not as feature-rich as OpenSSH, as it doesn't currently support
password-protected keyrings, the SSH 1.X protocols, TCP wrappers, etc.
On the other hand, it doesn't require OpenSSL, and doesn't take a lot of
work to avoid patented algorithms.
