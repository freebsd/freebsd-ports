KeePassX is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you
to manage your passwords in a secure way.  You can put all your
passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a
key-disk.  So you only have to remember one single master password or
insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database.  The databases are
encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently
known (AES and Twofish).
