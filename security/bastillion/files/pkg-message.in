Bastille is now installed in %%PREFIX%%/%%WWWDIR%% and %%PREFIX%%/jetty_bastillion.

Before the first start (but not if you update), you have to set a DB password in
    %%PREFIX%%/jetty_bastillion/bastillion/WEB-INF/classes/BastillionConfig.properties
You can do that via e.g.:
    # sed -i '' -e "s:dbPassword=:dbPassword=$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=10 | openssl base64):" \
       %%PREFIX%%/jetty_bastillion/bastillion/WEB-INF/classes/BastillionConfig.properties

You may want to activate it in /etc/rc.conf:
    # sysrc bastillion_enable="YES"

Once Bastille is started, point your web browser to the login page at
    https://<hostname>:8443/.

The update to 3.12.00 contains an incompatible DB change. Either recreate your
DB (rm %%PREFIX%%/jetty_bastillion/bastillion/WEB-INF/classes/keydb/bastillion.*
and restart) by hand, or export the old DB while the old version is
installed and import the data into a new DB. See
