ZXID aims at full stack implementation of all federated identity
management and identity web services protocols. Initial goal is
supporting SP role, followed by ID-WSF WSC and IdP roles.

ZXID is light weight, has a small foot print, and is implemented in C.
It is suitable for both high performance and embedded applications.
Scripting languages are supported using SWIG, including Perl, PHP and
Java. The "full stack" nature of ZXID means it's self contained and
has minimal external library dependencies (see downloads).
