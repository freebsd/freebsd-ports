The Simple File Verification (SFV) system is a file integrity verification
system which is popular on some platforms.  A software package may be
accompanied by an SFV file (usually with extension .sfv) which contains
CRC-32 checksums for all the files that comprise the package.

cksfv (Check SFV) can both create simple file verification (SFV) files, and
test file integrity against existing SFV files.
