This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence (a
group of easy to remember words) for the generation of deterministic wallets.

It consists of two parts: generating the mnenomic, and converting it into a
binary seed. This seed can be later used to generate deterministic wallets using
BIP-0032 or similar methods.
