The DES cipher should no longer be considered secure. Please consider
using a more modern alternative.

The bdes utility implements all DES modes of operation described in FIPS
PUB 81, including alternative cipher feedback mode and both authentica-
tion modes. The bdes utility reads from the standard input and writes to
the standard output. By default, the input is encrypted using cipher
block chaining (CBC) mode. Using the same key for encryption and decryp-
tion preserves plain text.
