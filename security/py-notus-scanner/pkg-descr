Notus Scanner detects vulnerable products in a system environment. The scanning
method is to evaluate internal system information. It does this very fast and
even detects currently inactive products because it does not need to interact
with each of the products.

To report about vulnerabilities, Notus Scanner receives collected system
information on the one hand and accesses the vulnerability information from the
feed service on the other. Both input elements are in table form: the system
information is specific to each environment and the vulnerability information
is specific to each system type.

Notus Scanner integrates into the Greenbone Vulnerability Management framework
which allows to let it scan entire networks within a single task. Any
vulnerability test in the format of .notus files inside the Greenbone Feed will
be considered and automatically matched with the scanned environments.
