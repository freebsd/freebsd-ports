saslauthd is a daemon process that handles plaintext authentication
requests on behalf of the SASL library.
 
The server fulfills two roles: it isolates all code requiring
superuser privileges into a single process, and it can be used to
provide proxy authentication services to clients that do not
understand SASL based authentication.
