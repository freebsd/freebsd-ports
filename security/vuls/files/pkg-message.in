  message: <<EOM
Congratulations, you have installed %%PORTNAME%%!

To use vuls, install vuls on all your machines and activate the daily
periodic script using

sysrc -f /etc/periodic.conf daily_vuls_enable="YES"

and perhaps also add some config parameters; check the information header of
%%PREFIX%%/etc/periodic/daily/%%PORTNAME%%.

Configure vuls by editing %%ETCDIR%%/config.toml.

Vuls uses the port security/go-cve-dictionary to look up information about
packages' CVEs. Install that port separately somewhere in your infrastructure,
start the service and point vuls to it for CVE queries by editing vuls'
configuration in %%PREFIX%%/etc/vuls.conf and setting the cveDict url properly.

If you want to use vuls to collect reports from several nodes, set up the vuls
service somewhere in your infrastructure. Set it up by enabling it and start it
using service:

sysrc %%PORTNAME%%_enable="YES"
service %%PORTNAME%% start

Also consider installing security/vulsrepo to present the resports in a
friendly human-readable web gui.
