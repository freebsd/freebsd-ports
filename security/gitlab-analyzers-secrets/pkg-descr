secrets analyzer performs Secret Detection scanning. It reports possible secret
leaks, like application tokens and cryptographic keys, in the source code and
files contained in your project.
The analyzer wraps Gitleaks tool, and is written in Go. It's structured
similarly to other Static Analysis analyzers because it uses the shared
command package.
The analyzer is built and published as a Docker image in the GitLab Container
Registry associated with this repository. You would typically use this analyzer
in the context of a SAST, IaC, or Secret Detection job in your CI/CD pipeline.
However, if you're contributing to the analyzer or you need to debug a problem,
you can run, debug, and test locally using Docker.
