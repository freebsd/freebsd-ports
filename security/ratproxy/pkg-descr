Ratproxy is a semi-automated, largely passive web application security audit
tool. It is meant to complement active crawlers and manual proxies more
commonly used for this task, and is optimized specifically for an accurate and
sensitive detection, and automatic annotation, of potential problems and
security-relevant design patterns based on the observation of existing,
user-initiated traffic in complex web 2.0 environments.
