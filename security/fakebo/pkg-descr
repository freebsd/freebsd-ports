FakeBO emulates a BackOrifice client (a trojan which can be used to
covertly monitor and alter Windows machines remotely), and can log
attempted commands and packets, as well as providing configurable
responses. Useful for catching script kiddies trying to find a hackable
Windows box, for providing evidence to their sysadmin, etc.
