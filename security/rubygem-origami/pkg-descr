Origami is NOT a PDF rendering library.  It aims at providing a scripting tool
to generate and analyze malicious PDF files.  As well, it can be used to create
on-the-fly customized PDFs, or to inject (evil) code into already existing
documents.
- Create PDF documents from scratch.
- Parse existing documents, modify them and recompile them.
- Explore documents at the object level, going deep into the document
  structure, uncompressing PDF object streams and desobfuscating names and
  strings.
- High-level operations, such as encryption/decryption, signature, file
  attachments...
