fchksum is a Python module to find the checksum of files. Currently it
supports crc32 and md5 checksums.

The advantage of using fchksum over the python md5 and zlib(.crc32) modules
is both ease of use and speed. You only need to tell it the filename and the
actual work is done by C code. Compared to the implementing a read loop in
python with the standard python modules, fchksum is approximatly 2.0x faster
in md5 and 1.1x faster in crc32.
