Secure Shell is a set of programs for logging into a remote machine and for
executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to replace rlogin,
rsh, rcp, etc. and provide secure encrypted communications between two
untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and arbitrary
TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

OpenSSH is a version of Secure Shell based upon a much less encumbered
SSH version 1.2.12, which has a BSD-style license.  Maintained by the
OpenBSD project, this is the most free and secure SSH implementation
in the world.  OpenSSH supports SSH protocol version 1.5 and 2.0.

If you don't need SKEY/OPIE you like to use openssh-portable
