liboqs provides:
* a collection of open source implementations of quantum-safe key encapsulation
  mechanism (KEM) and digital signature algorithms; the full list can be found
  below
* a common API for these algorithms
* a test harness and benchmarking routines

liboqs is part of the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project led by Douglas Stebila and
Michele Mosca, which aims to develop and integrate into applications
quantum-safe cryptography to facilitate deployment and testing in real world
contexts. In particular, OQS provides prototype integrations of liboqs into TLS
and SSH, through OpenSSL and OpenSSH.
