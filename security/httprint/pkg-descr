httprint is a web server fingerprinting tool. It relies on web server
characteristics to accurately identify web servers, despite the fact that
they may have been obfuscated by changing the server banner strings, or
by plug-ins such as mod_security or servermask. httprint can also be used
to detect web enabled devices which do not have a server banner string,
such as wireless access points, routers, switches, cable modems, etc.
httprint uses text signature strings and it is very easy to add signatures
to the signature database.
