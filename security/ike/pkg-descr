This port contains the Shrew Soft IKE daemon and client tools. The
software supports IKE V1 communications with an emphasis on client
functionality. It was orginally designed to compliment a gateway
running the ipsec-tools racoon daemon. The latest version offers a
high level of compatibility with Cisco, Juniper, Zywall, Fortigate
and many other commercial IPsec VPN gateways.
