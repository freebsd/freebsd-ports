This Python package is a high-level wrapper for Kerberos (GSSAPI) operations.
The goal is to avoid having to build a module that wraps the entire
Kerberos.framework, and instead offer a limited set of functions that do what is
needed for client/server Kerberos authentication based on
<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt>.
