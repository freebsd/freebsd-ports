Maltrail is a malicious traffic detection system, utilizing publicly
available (black)lists containing malicious and/or generally suspicious
trails, along with static trails compiled from various AV reports and
custom user defined lists, where trail can be anything from domain name
(e.g. zvpprsensinaix.com for Banjori malware), 
URL (e.g. http://109.162.38.120/harsh02.exe for known malicious executable),
IP address (e.g. 185.130.5.231 for known attacker) or HTTP User-Agent header
value (e.g. sqlmap for automatic SQL injection and database takeover tool).
Also, it uses (optional) advanced heuristic mechanisms that can help in 
discovery of unknown threats (e.g. new malware).
