The Greenbone Vulnerability Management Tools gvm-tools are a collection of
tools that help with remote controlling a Greenbone Security Manager (GSM)
appliance and its underlying Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM). The tools
aid in accessing the communication protocols GMP (Greenbone Management
Protocol) and OSP (Open Scanner Protocol).

This module is comprised of interactive and non-interactive clients. The
programming language Python is supported directly for interactive scripting.
But it is also possible to issue remote GMP/OSP commands without programming
in Python.
