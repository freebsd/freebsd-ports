Logcheck helps spot problems and security violations in your logfiles 
automatically and will send the results to you in e-mail.

Logcheck is part of the Abacus Project of security tools. It is a program 
created to help in the processing of UNIX system logfiles generated by the 
various Abacus Project tools, system daemons, Wietse Venema's TCP Wrapper 
and Log Daemon packages, and the Firewall Toolkit(c) by Trusted Information 
Systems Inc.(TIS). Logcheck also works very well at reporting on other 
common operating system security violations and strange events.
