Logcheck helps spot problems and security violations in your logfiles 
automatically and will send the results to you in e-mail.

It is a program created to help in the processing of UNIX system logfiles
generated by the various system daemons.  Logcheck also works very well at
reporting on other common operating system security violations and strange
events.
