LibreSSL is an open-source implementation of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and
Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. It was forked from the OpenSSL
cryptographic software library in April 2014 as a response by OpenBSD
developers to the Heartbleed security vulnerability in OpenSSL,
with the aim of refactoring the OpenSSL code so as to provide a more secure
implementation.

LibreSSL was forked from the OpenSSL library starting with the 1.0.1g branch
and will follow the security guidelines used elsewhere in the OpenBSD project.
