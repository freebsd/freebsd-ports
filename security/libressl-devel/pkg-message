In version 2.4.0, the OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER patch has been removed.

Before, the version for the FreeBSD ports was locked to the time of forking,
which was 1.0.1f (0x1000107fL). Now the version is unmodified (0x20000000L).

Ports that check e.g. >= 0x10002000 to determine features added in OpenSSL
1.0.2 are likely to fail during build. Fixes for ports known to fail this
way are collected in:
