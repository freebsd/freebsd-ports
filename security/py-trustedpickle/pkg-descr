TrustedPickle is a Python module that can save most any arbitrary Python object
 in a signed pickle file. There are two big differences between this module and
 the standard pickle module. First, TrustedPickle can pickle a module, but the
standard pickle module cannot. Second, TrustedPickle includes a signature that
can verify the data's origin before the data is unpickled.
