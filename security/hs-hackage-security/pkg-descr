The hackage security library provides both server and client utilities for
securing the Hackage package server (http://hackage.haskell.org/). It is based on
The Update Framework (http://theupdateframework.com/), a set of recommendations
developed by security researchers at various universities in the US as well as
developers on the Tor project (https://www.torproject.org/).

The current implementation supports only index signing, thereby enabling
untrusted mirrors. It does not yet provide facilities for author package
signing.

The library has two main entry points: Hackage.Security.Client is the main entry
point for clients (the typical example being cabal), and Hackage.Security.Server
is the main entry point for servers (the typical example being hackage-server).
