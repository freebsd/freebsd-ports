  message: <<EOM

crowdsec is installed.

You need to check/edit the following files in %%ETCDIR%% as described in https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/configuration/crowdsec_configuration

 - config.yaml: main configuration
 - acquis.yaml: where to find logs to parse (this port does not include automatic discovery of the running services)
 - profiles.yaml: remediation policies (ban, duration, etc)

Then you can enable the daemon via sysrc and run it.

# sysrc crowdsec_enable="YES"
crowdsec_enable: NO -> YES
# service crowdsec start
EOM
