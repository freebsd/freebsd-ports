Scan Apache log files for CodeRed, Nimda, FormMail, proxy scanners and
other malicious probes. For each one found, track down the contact email
from WHOIS data and send a notice. Built-in rate controls prevent flooding
an admin even when his machines are scanning at high rates. Runs as a
non-privileged cron job to not interfere with the HTTP daemon's operation.
