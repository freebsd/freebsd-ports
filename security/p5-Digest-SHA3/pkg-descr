Digest::SHA3 is a complete implementation of the NIST SHA-3 cryptographic hash
function, as specified in Draft FIPS 202 (SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based
Hash and Extendable-Output Functions).

The module gives Perl programmers a convenient way to calculate SHA3-224,
SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512 message digests, as well as variable-length
hashes using SHAKE128 and SHAKE256. Digest::SHA3 can handle all types of input,
including partial-byte data.
