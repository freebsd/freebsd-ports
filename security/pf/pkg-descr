Packet Filter (from here on referred to as PF) is OpenBSD's system for 
filtering TCP/IP traffic and doing Network Address Translation. PF is also 
capable of normalizing and conditioning TCP/IP traffic and providing bandwidth
control and packet prioritization. 

Version 2.00 of this port has the same function set as found in OpenBSD 3.4
