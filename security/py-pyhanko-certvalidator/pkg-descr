pyhanko-certvalidator is a Python library for validating X.509 certificates
paths. It supports various options, including: validation at a specific moment
in time, whitelisting and revocation checks.

This library started as a fork of wbond/certvalidator with patches for pyHanko,
but has since diverged considerably from its parent repository.
