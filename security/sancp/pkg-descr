Sancp is a network security tool designed to collect 
statistical information regarding network traffic, as 
well as, collect the traffic itself in pcap format, all 
for the purpose of: auditing, historical analysis, and 
network activity discovery. Rules can be used to distinguish 
normal from abnormal traffic and support tagging connections 
with: rule id, node id, and status id.  From an intrusion 
detection standpoint, every connection is an event that must 
be validated through some means. Sancp uses rules to identify, 
record, and tag traffic of interest. 'Tagging' a connection 
is a new feature since v1.4.0 Connections ('stats') can be 
loaded into a database for further analysis.
