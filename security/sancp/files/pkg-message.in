A startup script was installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/.  Enable the script
in /etc/rc.conf using the usual rc.subr syntax.  See rc.conf(5) or go to
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/configtuning-rcng.html

Configuration files named sancp.conf-dist and sancp.conf
were installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc.  See the INSTALL doc, located in
%%PREFIX%%/share/doc/sancp/ for details on configuration
options or type "sancp -h" on the commandline.

Note that if you are installing sancp for use with sguil, the
sancp.conf file will not be altered unless it is identical to
the sancp.conf-dist file.  In that case, during the
sguil-sensor install, the sancp.conf file will be overwritten with
the one that comes with squil.  That file needs no editing.  If the
sancp.conf has been altered (you used sancp for something else) a
new conf file, named sguil-sancp.conf-sample will be installed in the
%%PREFIX%%/etc directory.  You should use that one for sguil.

All of the configuration options for sancp are documented in the 
startup script in %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d (don't forget to specify interface
in /etc/rc.conf)

If you're running sguil, you probably want to use at least the following flags:
sancp_flags="-D -P -R -u sancp -g sancp -d /var/log/sancp"
