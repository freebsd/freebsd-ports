Crypt::Password::Util is a crypt password utilities.

Its crypt($str) works like Perl's crypt(), but automatically choose the
appropriate crypt type and random salt. Will first choose SSHA512 with 64-bit
random salt. If not supported by system, fall back to MD5-CRYPT with 32-bit
random salt. If that is not supported, fall back to CRYPT.

Its crypt_type($str) returns crypt type, or undef if $str does not look like a
crypted password. Currently known types: CRYPT (traditional DES crypt),
MD5-CRYPT (including Apache variant), SSHA256 (salted SHA256), SSHA512 (salted
SHA512), and PLAIN-MD5.

See also Authen::Passphrase which recognizes more encodings (but currently not
SSHA256 and SSHA512).
