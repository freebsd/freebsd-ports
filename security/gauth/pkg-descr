gauth is a command-line utility that replaces Google Authenticator, providing a
convenient way to generate two-factor authentication codes from your terminal.
It stores secrets locally, supports encryption, and offers features like
displaying progress bars, adding/removing keys, and compatibility with
various services like AWS, Github, and more. This tool is ideal for
users who prefer managing their 2FA on their computers rather than
relying solely on their smartphones.
