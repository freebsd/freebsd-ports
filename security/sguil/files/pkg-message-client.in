Sguil-client
============
See the USAGE document in the %%DOCSDIR%% for instructions
on how to use the sguil client to connect to and maintain
the sguil network monitoring system.

NOTE: This port installs a sguil.conf-sample file in
%%PREFIX%%/bin/%%CLIENT_SGUILDIR%%/.  If you are installing this on a
multi-user system, each user might want to have a
sguil.conf file in their home directory.  Sguil.tk sources
the home directory first for the sguil.conf file.

There are several items in the conf file that may need
editing, including the path to your web browser, the name
of the sguil server you connect to and possibly the port
you connect to (if you're not using the default port.)
