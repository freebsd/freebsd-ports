To enable SSHGuard at startup, add the following line to your 'rc.conf':
sshguard_enable="YES"

Starting SSHGuard through syslogd(8) is discouraged and not supported.

Configure SSHGuard by editing BACKEND in '%%PREFIX%%/etc/sshguard.conf'. See
sshguard-setup(7) for instructions on setting up your firewall.

Please note that a few rc script parameters have been renamed to
better reflect the documentation:

sshguard_safety_thresh -> sshguard_danger_thresh
sshguard_pardon_min_interval -> sshguard_release_interval
sshguard_prescribe_interval -> sshguard_reset_interval
