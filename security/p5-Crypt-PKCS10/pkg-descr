A small command line utility for parsing PKCS#10 certificate signing
requests to perl data structure and provides accessor methods to
supported elements.

It is based on the generic ASN.1 module by Graham Barr and on the
x509decode example by Norbert Klasen. It is also based upon the
works of Duncan Segrests Crypt-X509-CRL module. The module parses
common fields and extensions. Some fields might be missing.
