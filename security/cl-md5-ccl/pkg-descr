This package implements the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm, as defined in RFC
1321, in Common Lisp.

Warning: The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm has been compromised as a
cryptographically secure hash for a long time, with known theoretical and
practical attacks.  Therefore, use of this implementation is recommended only
for legacy purposes or cases where a cryptographically secure hash is not
required.  For all other uses, consider one of the newer SHA-2 or SHA-3 secure
hash standards, or whatever is currently deemed cryptographically secure.

This package is compiled with CCL.
