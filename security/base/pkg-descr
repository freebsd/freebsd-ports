BASE is the Basic Analysis and Security Engine. It is based on the code
from the ACID project. This application provides a PHP-based web front-end
to query and analyze the alerts coming from a Snort IDS system.

BASE is a web interface to perform analysis of intrusions that Snort has
detected on your network. It uses a user authentication and role-base
system, so that you as the security admin can decide what and how much
information each user can see. It also has a simple to use, web-based
setup program for people not comfortable with editing files directly.
