This ident daemon runs as either a standalong daemon or as a child of inetd.
Replies of your choice can be generated through a .ident file in the users
home directory.   A .noident will make it do an ident will not be conducted
if the file is found in the users home directory.

The server can also send random replies to all requests.  This simplifies
the problem of using IRC through a NATD network.
