git-secret is a bash tool which stores private data inside a git repo. 
git-secret encrypts tracked files with public keys for users whom you 
trust using gpg, allowing permitted users to access encrypted data 
using their secret keys. With git-secret, changes to access rights are 
made easy and private-public key issues are handled for you. Passwords 
do not need to be changed with git-secret when someone's permission 
is revoked - just remove their key from the keychain using git secret 
killperson their@email.com, and re-encrypt the files, and they won't 
be able to decrypt secrets anymore.
