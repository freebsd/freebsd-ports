During deinstall of this package, the cfg files for broctl are not
deleted if you have edited them. Instead the software will create
a .sample file instead and the edited files will remain in place
when you upgrade. If you want to delete them, you have to remove
the %%PREFIX%%/etc directory manually.

The rc.d script now honors the zeek_user rc.d variable.  To run as
a user other than root (the default) you need to make a few changes.
For example to run as the user zeek, add this to /etc/rc.conf:

    zeek_enable="YES"
    zeek_user="zeek"

Add this to /etc/devfs.conf:

    own     bpf     root:bpf
    perm    bpf     0660

And add zeek to the bpf group:

    bpf:*:81:zeek

and restart the devfs service:

    service devfs restart

or reboot.

If the interface defined in node.cfg is configured for NIC checksum
offloading (the default when this feature is supported by the
hardware) you will want to set ignore_checksums in site/local.zeek:

    redef ignore_checksums = T;
EOM
}
