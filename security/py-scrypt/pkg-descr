This is is a set of Python bindings for the scrypt key derivation function.

Scrypt is useful when encrypting password as it is possible to specify a
minimum amount of time to use when encrypting and decrypting. If, for example,
a password takes 0.05 seconds to verify, a user won't notice the slight delay
when signing in, but doing a brute force search of several billion passwords
will take a considerable amount of time. This is in contrast to more
traditional hash functions such as MD5 or the SHA family which can be
implemented extremely fast on cheap hardware.
