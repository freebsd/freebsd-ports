American fuzzy lop is a fuzzer that employs a novel type of compile-time
instrumentation and genetic algorithms to automatically discover clean,
interesting test cases that trigger new internal states in the targeted
binary. This substantially improves the functional coverage for the
fuzzed code.

afl++ is a fork of afl that incorporates all community patches into
a single source distribution.
