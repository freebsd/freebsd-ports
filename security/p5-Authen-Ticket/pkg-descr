Authen::Ticket provides the framework for implementing a ticketing system
for web authentication.  Both the client website and ticket server code
can be constructed from Authen::Ticket.  The framework allows for customization
at all phases in the process.  This includes not only the login screens, but
the cookie creation and optional digital signature algorithm as well.  Consult
the README for more details on this module.
