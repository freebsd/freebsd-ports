The Hidden Lake is an anonymous network built on a micro-service
architecture. At the heart of HL is the core - HLK (service), which generates
anonymizing (queue based) traffic and combines many other services
(HLS=filesharer, HLS=messenger, HLS=pinger and etc). Thus, Hidden Lake is not a
whole and monolithic solution, but a composition of several combined
services. The HL is a friend-to-friend (F2F) network, which means building
trusted communications. Due to this approach, members of the HL network can
avoid spam in their direction, as well as possible attacks if vulnerabilities
are found in the code.
