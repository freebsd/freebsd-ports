pdfcrack is a simple tool for recovering passwords (both owner and
user ones) from pdf-documents.  It should be able to handle all
pdfs that uses the standard security handler but the pdf-parsing
routines are a bit of a quick hack so you might stumble across some
pdfs where the parser needs to be fixed to handle.
