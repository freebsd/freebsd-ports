The Bro Package Manager makes it easy for Bro users to install
and manage third party scripts as well as plugins for Bro and
BroControl. The command-line tool is preconfigured scripts as
well as plugins for Bro and BroControl. The command-line tool 
is preconfigured to download packages from the Bro package source,
a GitHub repository that has been setup such that any developer
can request their Bro package be included. See the README file
of that repository for information regarding the package submission
process. NOTE: It's left up to users to decide for themselves 
via code review, GitHub comments/stars, or other metrics whether
any given package is trustworthy as there is no implied guarantees
that it's secure just because it's been accepted into the default
package source. See the package manager documentation for further
usage information, how-to guides, and walkthroughs. For offline
reading, it's also available in the doc/ directory of the
source code distribution.
