libpwstor is a library implementing a password storage format
for C programmers.  This format provides a reasonable level of
security by utilizing SHA-256 in addition to a random salt to
mitigate dictionary and rainbow table attacks.

In addition to the core functionality, libpwstor also offers
some additional functions such as Base64 encoding and decoding.
All functionality is implemented and designed in such a way as
to be easy to use for C programmers of varying skill levels,
while preserving reasonable security in the underlying storage
format.
