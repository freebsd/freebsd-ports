Use OSV-Scanner to find existing vulnerabilities affecting your projects
dependencies.

OSV-Scanner provides an officially supported frontend to the OSV database
that connects a projects list of dependencies with the vulnerabilities
that affect them. Since the OSV.dev database is open source and distributed,
it has several benefits in comparison with closed source advisory databases
and scanners:

* Each advisory comes from an open and authoritative source.
* Anyone can suggest improvements to advisories, resulting in a very high
  quality database.
* The OSV format unambiguously stores information about affected versions
  in a machine-readable format that precisely maps onto a developers list
  of packages.

The above all results in fewer, more actionable vulnerability notifications,
which reduces the time needed to resolve them.
