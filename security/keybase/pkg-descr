Keybase.io client and Keybase Filesystem (KBFS)

Keybase will be a public directory of publicly auditable public keys. All
paired, for convenience, with unique usernames.

kbfs is the official Keybase implementation of the client-side code for the
Keybase filesystem (KBFS). This client allows you to mount KBFS as a proper
filesystem at some mountpoint on your local device (by default, /keybase/). It
communicates locally with the Keybase service, and remotely with three types of
KBFS servers (block servers, metadata servers, and key servers).
