Skein is a family of fast secure cryptographic hash functions designed
by Niels Ferguson, Stefan Lucks, Bruce Schneier, Doug Whiting, Mihir
Bellare, Tadayoshi Kohno, Jon Callas and Jesse Walker.  This package
uses bindings to the optimized C implementation of Skein.  We provide a
high-level interface (see module Crypto.Skein) to some of the Skein use
cases.  We also provide a low-level interface (see module
Crypto.Skein.Internal) should you need to use Skein in a different way.
Currently we have support for Skein as cryptographic hash function as
Skein as a message authentication code (Skein-MAC).
