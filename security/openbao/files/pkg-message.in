  message: <<EOM
The %%USER%% user created by the bao package is now a member of the daemon
class, which will allow it to use mlock() when started by the rc script. This
will not be reflected in systems where the user already exists. Please add the
bao user to the daemon class manually by running:

pw usermod -L daemon -n %%USER%%

or delete the user and reinstall the package.

You may also need to increase memorylocked for the daemon class in
/etc/rc.conf to more than 1024M (the default) or more:

openbao_limits_mlock="2048M"

Or to disable mlock, add:

disable_mlock = 1

to %%PREFIX%%/etc/openbao.hcl
EOM
}
