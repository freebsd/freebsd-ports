Native Haskell TLS and SSL protocol implementation for server and
client.  This provides a high-level implementation of a sensitive
security protocol, eliminating a common set of security issues through
the use of the advanced type system, high level constructions and common
Haskell features.  Currently implement the SSL3.0, TLS1.0, TLS1.1 and
TLS1.2 protocol, and support RSA and Ephemeral (Elliptic curve and
regular) Diffie Hellman key exchanges, and many extensions.
