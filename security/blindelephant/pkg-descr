The BlindElephant Web Application Fingerprinter attempts to discover
the version of a (known) web application by comparing static files
at known locations against precomputed hashes for versions of those
files in all all available releases. The technique is fast,
low-bandwidth, non-invasive, generic, and highly automatable.
