"dds" is a program to scan for a limited set of distributed denial of
service (ddos) agents.

At present, it scans for active instances of "trinoo", "Tribe Flood
Network" ("TFN") and "stacheldraht" agents, which were compiled
using the default values in known source distributions, such as those
found at:

	http://packetstorm.securify.com/distributed/

It will *not* detect TFN2K agents.

For analyses of the three distributed denial of service attack
tools it scans for, and the methods being used by dds to identify
them, see:
