Wassima offers you a great alternative to certifi. It is a simple yet efficient
wrapper around MIT licensed rustls-native-certs.

This project allows you to access your original operating system trust store,
thus helping you to verify the remote peer certificates.

It works as-is out-of-the-box for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Automatically
fallback on Certifi otherwise. Available on PyPy and Python 3.7+

If your particular operating system is not supported, we will make this happen!
Open an issue on the repository.

For now, it is not supported to call your OS certificate verify native function.
Use your Python native capabilities for it.
