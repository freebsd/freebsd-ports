Enc is a CLI tool for encryption, a modern and friendly alternative
to GnuPG. It is easy to use, secure by default and can encrypt and
decrypt files using password or encryption keys, manage and download
keys, and sign data. Our goal was to make encryption available to
all engineers without the need to learn a lot of new words, concepts,
and commands. It is the most beginner-friendly CLI tool for encryption,
and keeping it that way is our top priority.
