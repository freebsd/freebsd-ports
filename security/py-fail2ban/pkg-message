Please do not edit the fail2ban.conf, jail.conf, or any other 
files in the distributen as they will be overwritten upon each 
upgrade of the port. Instead, create new files named *.local e.g. 
fail2ban.local or jail.local.

For more information, see the official manual:
http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/MANUAL_0_8#Configuration

If you have custom filters or actions and you are upgrading from
0.9.x please check them.

Users of pf: please read the notes in action.d/pf.conf and the
discussion at https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/pull/1925
Please note that fail2ban will put curly braces '{}' around the
ports in the action so you shouldn't do it yourself.
