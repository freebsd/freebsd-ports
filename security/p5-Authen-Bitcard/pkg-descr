Authen::Bitcard is an implementation of verification for signatures
generated by Bitcard authentication. For information on the Bitcard protocol
and using Bitcard in other applications, see http://www.bitcard.org/api.

The module and the protocol are heavily based on Authen::Typekey. (In fact,
the Bitcard authentication server also supports the TypeKey API!)
