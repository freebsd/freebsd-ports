The GNOME Password Manager - GPass for short - is a simple
application, written for the GNOME 2 desktop, that lets you manage a
collection of passwords.  The password collection is stored in an
encrypted file, protected by a master-password.

GPass is released under the GNU GPL2 licence.

Features:

    * Clean and easy-to-use user interface.
    * Quick-search facility.
    * Username and password may easily be copied to the clipboard.
    * Encryption is done using the OpenSSL cryptographics library.
    * The built-in password generator helps you generate secure passwords.
    * You can launch a website and the associated username/passwords
      direct from GPass
