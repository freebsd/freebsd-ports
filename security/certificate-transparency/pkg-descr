Google's Certificate Transparency project is an open framework for monitoring
and auditing SSL certificates in nearly real time.  It makes it possible
to detect SSL certificates that have been mistakenly issued by a certificate
authority or maliciously acquired from an otherwise unimpeachable certificate
authority. It also makes it possible to identify certificate authorities
that have gone rogue and are maliciously issuing certificates.
