Important security considerations
===============================================================================

Before using the 'edit' subcommand interactively, it's recommended to set the
SECURE_TMPDIR environment variable to a location that isn't written to disk,
such as a tmpfs mount, ideally using encrypted swap:

	https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/swap-encrypting.html

Also keep in mind your editor may create temporary files and backups in other
locations - consider disabling these features for files matching the pattern
lpass.* or within your $SECURE_TMPDIR.  For example, with vim:

	autocmd BufRead lpass.* setlocal noundofile nowritebackup noswapfile


===============================================================================
Using OpenSSL from ports
===============================================================================

If you're using security/openssl, ensure ftp/curl is configured with the
HEIMDAL_PORT option to avoid linking to two different OpenSSL libraries.


===============================================================================
Other steps
===============================================================================

lpass requires /proc to be mounted for correct operation.  To enable it add
the following to /etc/fstab and run 'mount /proc':

	proc		/proc		procfs	rw		0	0
