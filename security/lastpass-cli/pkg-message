Important security considerations
===============================================================================

Before using the 'edit' subcommand interactively, it's recommended to set the
SECURE_TMPDIR environment variable to a location that isn't written to disk,
such as a tmpfs mount, ideally using encrypted swap:

Also keep in mind your editor may create temporary files and backups in other
locations - consider disabling these features for files matching the pattern
lpass.* or within your $SECURE_TMPDIR.  For example, with vim:

	autocmd BufRead lpass.* setlocal noundofile nowritebackup noswapfile
