  message: <<EOM
Caldera port was installed

1) Take on mind it is a modifying version of Caldera for include FreeBSD as 
   supported OS and you could found some issues. Problem reports are welcome.

2) Add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf

  # sysrc caldera_enable="YES"

  or enable it from service command

  # service caldera enable

3) Before of start Caldera you must run some scripts for generate/update payload
   files

   # su -m caldera -c 'cd %%WWWDIR%%/plugins/manx && sh update-shells.sh'
   # su -m caldera -c 'cd %%WWWDIR%%/plugins/sandcat && sh update-agents.sh'

4) Do not forget modify configuration files before of run Caldera. For default
   it runs in insecure mode (http). Caldera configuration files are located at

   %%WWWDIR%%/conf

5) You can change default user passwords modifying default.yml file into
   %%WWWDIR%%/conf folder. By default Caldera uses admin/admin,
   blue/admin or red/admin like user/password.

   # sed -i "" -e "s|admin: admin|admin: `openssl rand -base64 14`|g" default.yml
   # sed -i "" -e "s|blue: admin|blue: `openssl rand -base64 14`|g" default.yml
   # sed -i "" -e "s|red: admin|red: `openssl rand -base64 14`|g" default.yml

6) If you want run it in secure mode (https) take a look in ssl plugin section:

   https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Plugin-library.html#ssl

7) Start Caldera service

   # service caldera start

8) When Caldera is starting, atomic plugin will use git to download files from
   the following link:

   https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team

   Currently, the project does not include FreeBSD like a supported platform.
   For this reason, Atomic plugin was patched for download atomic-red-team
   files from the following repository until my pull request will be merge into
   redcanaryco/atomic-red-team:

   https://github.com/alonsobsd/atomic-red-team

   Those files are necessary for generate yml files used by Caldera abilities

9) Caldera web listens on port 8888 by default

   http://your_caldera_server_ip:8888

10) Log file is located at /var/log/caldera.log

11) For more configure information you can look at the following link:
