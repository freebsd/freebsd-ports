Picocrypt is a very small (hence Pico), very simple, yet very secure
encryption tool that you can use to protect your files.  It is designed
to be the go-to tool for encryption, with a focus on security, simplicity,
and reliability.  Picocrypt uses the secure XChaCha20 cipher and the
Argon2id key derivation function to provide a high level of security,
even from three-letter agencies like the NSA.  It is designed for maximal
security, making absolutely no compromises security-wise, and is built
with Go's standard x/crypto modules.
