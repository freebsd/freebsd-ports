Barnyard is a critical tool for the parsing of Snort's unified binary files,
processing and on-forwarding to a variety of output plugins. Unfortunately
it has not seen an updated in over 4 years and is not going to be maintained
by the original developers. With the new version of the unified format
(ie. unified2) arriving we need something to bridge this gap.

The SXL team love barnyard. So much so that we want it to stay and have been
tinkering around with the code to give it a breath of new life. Here is what
we have achieved to far for this reinvigorated code base:

    * Parsing of the new unified2 log files.
    * Maintaining majority of the command syntax of barnyard.
    * Addressed all associated bug reports and feature requests arising since
		barnyard-0.2.0.
    * Completely rewritten code based on the GPLv2 Snort making it entirely
		GPLv2.

This is an effort to fuse the awesome work of Snort and the original concept
of barnyard giving it a fresh update along the way. We've come a long way so
far and have a very stable build that we've integrated into our NSMnow
framework.  If you have any feature requests, bugs or gripes then send them
our way.
