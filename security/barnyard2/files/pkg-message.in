Read the notes in the barnyard2.conf file for how to configure
%%PREFIX%%/etc/barnyard2.conf after installation.  For addtional information
see the Securixlive FAQ at http://www.securixlive.com/barnyard2/faq.php.

In order to enable barnyard2 to start on boot, you must edit /etc/rc.conf
with the appropriate flags, etc.  See the FreeBSD Handbook for syntax:
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/configtuning-rcng.html

For the various options available, type % barnyard2 -h after install or read
the options in the startup script - in %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d.

Barnyard2 can process unified2 files from snort or suricata.  It can also
interact with snortsam firewall rules as well as the sguil-sensor. Those
ports must be installed separately if you wish to use them.
