A tiny Perl extension to generate cryptographically-secure random bytes.

It provides random bytes from a cryptographically secure random
number generator (ISAAC), seeded from strong entropy sources on a
wide variety of platforms. It does so without external dependencies
(except on Windows), and has a minimal but useful user interface
patterned after the module Bytes::Random::Secure.
