domain and a contact mail address.

In order to run the script regularly to update
the certificates add this line to /etc/periodic.conf

weekly_dehydrated_enable="YES"

Additionally the following parameters can be added to
/etc/periodic.conf

To run the certification renenewal as a different user
weekly_dehydrated_user="_letsencrypt"

To run a script after the renewal (as root)
weekly_dehydrated_deployscript="%%PREFIX%%/etc/%%PORTNAME%%/deploy.sh"

Additional flags for the periodic run go into

If weekly run is not frequent enough, such as when fetching OCSP

as follows to run dehydrated daily. Options are exactly same with
weekly.

daily_dehydrated_enable="YES"
daily_dehydrated_user="_letsencrypt"
daily_dehydrated_deployscript="%%PREFIX%%/etc/%%PORTNAME%%/deploy.sh"
daily_dehydrated_flags="-g"
