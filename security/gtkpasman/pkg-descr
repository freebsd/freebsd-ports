The purpose of Gtkpasman is to provide system and network administrators a 
convenient tool to manage a passwords knowledge base related to customers,
servers, services... It can help to retrieve passwords, or even connect to
servers (ssh, telnet, ftp).
Passwords must be kept in a gnupg crypted file. The structure of the file is 
predefined, but very easy to edit and maintain. The gtk application can switch 
between a discret applet and a full list of containers.
