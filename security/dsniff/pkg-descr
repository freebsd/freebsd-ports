dsniff is a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration testing.
dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy passively monitor
a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail, files, etc.). arpspoof,
dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception of network traffic normally
unavailable to an attacker (e.g, due to layer-2 switching). sshmitm and webmitm
implement active monkey-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS
sessions by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI.
