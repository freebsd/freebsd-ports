This is an OSP server implementation to allow GVM to remotely control OpenVAS,
see https://github.com/greenbone/openvas.

Once running, you need to configure OpenVAS for the Greenbone Vulnerability
Manager, for example via the web interface Greenbone Security Assistant. Then
you can create scan tasks to use OpenVAS.
