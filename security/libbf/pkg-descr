The Blowfish Library

Blowfish is a block cipher that operates on 64bit (8 byte) quantities.
It uses variable size key, but 128bit (16 byte) key would normally be
considered good.  It can be used in all the modes that DES can be
used.  This library implements the ecb, cbc, cfb64, ofb64 modes.

Blowfish is quite a bit faster that DES, and much faster than IDEA
or RC2. It is one of the faster block ciphers.
