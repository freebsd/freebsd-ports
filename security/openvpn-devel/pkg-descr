OpenVPN is a robust, scalable and highly configurable VPN (Virtual Private
Network) daemon which can be used to securely link two or more private networks
using an encrypted tunnel over the internet. It can operate over UDP or TCP,
can use SSL or a pre-shared secret to authenticate peers, and in SSL mode, one
server can handle many clients.

This development port is updated frequently and is likely NOT STABLE.  This is
an untested tar of the source tree.  We attempt to omit inoperable states, but
there is a good chance this program will not run.

DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION WITHOUT CAUTION
