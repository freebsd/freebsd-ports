PyMe is a Python interface to GPGME library.

PyMe's development model is GPGME + Python + SWIG (just like m2crypto is
an OpenSSL + Python + SWIG) combination which means that most of the
functions and types are converted from C into Python automatically by SWIG.
In short, to be able to use PyMe you need to be familiar with GPGME.
