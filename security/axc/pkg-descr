Client lib for libsignal-c, implementing the needed database and crypto
interfaces using SQLite and gcrypt. Initially, the library's name was
libaxolotl, hence the name.

Additionally it provides utility functions for common use cases like
encrypting and decrypting, ultimately making direct use of libsignal
unnecessary.
