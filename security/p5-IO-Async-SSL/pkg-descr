This module extends existing IO::Async classes with extra methods to allow the
use of SSL or TLS-based connections using IO::Socket::SSL. It does not directly
provide any methods or functions of its own.

Primarily, it provides SSL_connect and SSL_listen, which yield
IO::Socket::SSL-upgraded socket handles or IO::Async::SSLStream instances, and
two forms of SSL_upgrade to upgrade an existing TCP connection to use SSL.
