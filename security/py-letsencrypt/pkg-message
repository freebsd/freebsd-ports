===========================================================================

This software is a DEVELOPER PREVIEW intended for developers, testers and
early-adopters only. Support requests and bug reports should be sent directly
and only to the upstream project: https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt

letsencrypt is currently in Closed Beta (invite only). In order to
acquire certificates, you must have applied for and received an invitation,
and have your domains whitelisted FIRST.

This port installs the "standalone" Python client only, which does not use and
is not the letsencrypt-auto bootstrap/wrapper script.

By default, the client will authenticate and obtain certificates using, and
signed by a TEST(Staging) Certificate Authority (CA). These certificates will
NOT be trusted publicly.

To obtain certificates, use the --server argument pointing to the correct
server URL as documented in your invitation email, and use the 'certonly'
command as follows:

 # sudo letsencrypt --server <server-URL> certonly

Note: The client currently requires the ability to bind on TCP port 80. If
you have a server running on this port, it will need to be temporarily stopped
so that the standalone server can listen on that port to complete
authentication.

The letsencrypt plugins to support apache and nginx certificate installation
will be made available soon in the following ports:

 * Apache plugin: security/py-letsencrypt-apache
 * Nginx plugin: security/py-letsencrypt-nginx
