Heimdal::Kadm5 is a Perl XS wrapper around the Heimdal Kerberos
administrative client library (libkadm5clnt).  Heimdal is a free slightly
less export challenged implementation of Kerberos5 by Assar Westerlund and
Johan Danielsson.  This module exposes the API used to administer a
Kerberos realm: add, remove, and list principals, create keytabs, change
keys, and similar operations.
