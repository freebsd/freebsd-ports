Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs
comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including
over 6100 potentially dangerous files/CGIs, checks for outdated
versions of over 950 servers, and version specific problems on over
260 servers. It also checks for server configuration items such as
the presence of multiple index files, HTTP server options, and will
attempt to identify installed web servers and software. Scan items
and plugins are frequently updated and can be automatically updated.

It uses Rain Forest Puppy's LibWhisker (wiretrip.net) for HTTP
functionality, and can perform checks in HTTP or HTTPS.  It also
supports basic port scanning and will determine if a web server is
running on any open ports.
