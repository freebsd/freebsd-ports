kbfs is the official Keybase implementation of the client-side code for the
Keybase filesystem (KBFS).

This client allows you to mount KBFS as a proper filesystem at some mountpoint
on your local device (by default, /keybase/). It communicates locally with the
Keybase service, and remotely with three types of KBFS servers (block servers,
metadata servers, and key servers).
