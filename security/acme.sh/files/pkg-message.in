This script will create the following directories if they do not exist:

 ~acme/.acme.sh
 ~acme/certs

The script will also install ~acme/.acme.sh/account.conf.sample which has
sane defaults.  Copy this to ~acme/.acme.sh/account.conf and edit contents
to suit.

In the %%EXAMPLESDIR%% directory, you can find the dnsapi 
scripts which will be useful if you decide to use dns-01 challenges. Also 
included are the deploy scripts.

A newsyslog.conf sample file is provided at %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/acme.sh
and you could create a symlink from that to %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/

Your sample cronjob looks like this:

############################################################################
$ sudo crontab -l -u acme
# use /bin/sh to run commands, overriding the default set by cron
SHELL=/bin/sh
# mail any output to here, no matter whose crontab this is
MAILTO=dan@example.org

7 22 * * * /usr/local/sbin/acme.sh --cron --home /var/db/acme/.acme.sh > /dev/null
############################################################################

Change x & y to some minute and hour of the day.
