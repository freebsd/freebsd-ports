gpg-tui is a Terminal User Interface for GnuPG.

It aims to ease the key management operations such as listing, exporting,
signing by providing an interface along with the command-line fallback for
more complex operations. It is not trying to be a full-fledged interface
for all the features that gpg provides but it tries to bring a more
interactive approach to key management.
