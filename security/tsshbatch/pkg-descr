'tsshbatch' is a tool to enable you to issue a command to many
servers without having to log into each one separately. When writing
scripts, this overcomes the 'ssh' limitation of not being able to
specify the password on the command line.

'tsshbatch' also understands basic 'sudo' syntax and can be used
to access a server, 'sudo' a command, and then exit.

'tsshbatch' thus allows you to write complex, hands-off scripts that
issue commands to many servers without the tedium of manual login and
'sudo' promotion. System administrators, especially, will find this
helpful when working in large server farms.
