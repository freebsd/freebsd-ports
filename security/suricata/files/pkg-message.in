If you want to run Suricata in IDS mode, add to /etc/rc.conf:

	suricata_enable="YES"
	suricata_interface="<if>"

NOTE: Declaring suricata_interface is MANDATORY for Suricata in IDS Mode.

However, if you wanna run Suricata in Inline IPS Mode, add to /etc/rc.conf:

	suricata_enable="YES"
	suricata_divertport="8000"

NOTE:
	Suricata won't start in IDS mode without an interface configured.
	Therefore if you omit suricata_interface from rc.conf, FreeBSD's
	rc.d/suricata will automatically try to start Suricata in IPS Mode
	(on divert port 8000, by default).

RULES: Suricata IDS/IPS Engine comes without rules by default. You should
add rules by yourself and set an updating strategy. To do so, please visit:

You may want to try BPF in zerocopy mode to test performance improvements:

	sysctl -w net.bpf.zerocopy_enable=1

Don't forget to add net.bpf.zerocopy_enable=1 to /etc/sysctl.conf
