txtorcon is an implementation of the control-spec for Tor using the Twisted
networking library for Python.

This is useful for writing utilities to control or make use of Tor in
event-based Python programs. If your Twisted program supports endpoints (like
twistd does) your server or client can make use of Tor immediately, with no
code changes. Start your own Tor or connect to one and get live stream, circuit,
relay updates; read and change config; monitor events; build circuits; create
onion services; etcetera (ReadTheDocs).
