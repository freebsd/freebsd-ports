This is the metaport to install GVM applications and libraries.

When the OpenVAS project was created it only consisted of an engine for
scanning vulnerabilities. Shortly after Greenbone Networks was funded to
achieve professional support for vulnerability scanning. Greenbone started to
lead the development, added several software components and turned OpenVAS into
a vulnerability management solution still keeping the values of free software.

After several years it became obvious that using OpenVAS as the brand name for
the open source project and funding nearly all development of the project was
not recognized from the outside. Therefore after the release of the OpenVAS 9
framework it got renamed to Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) and
released as Greenbone Source Edition (GSE).
