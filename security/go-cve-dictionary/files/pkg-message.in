  message: <<EOM
Congratulations, you have installed %%PORTNAME%%!

Setup go-cve-dictionary to use you preferred database type and set up access by
editing the config file at %%PREFIX%%/etc/go-cve-dictionary.yaml. There's a
default setup for your convenience using sqlite3, but you can also choose
Redis, PostgreSQL or MySQL if you prefer that.

go-cve-dictionary does not ship any CVE database. Instead, to download CVEs
from 2002 until present and keep them updated, activate the periodic script by
running

sysrc -f /etc/periodic.conf daily_go_cve_dictionary_enable="YES"

Then, to fetch the NVD database of CVEs immediately, run

/usr/local/etc/periodic/daily/go-cve-dictionary

To enable the go-cve-dictionary service, edit
%%PREFIX%%/etc/go-cve-dictionary.yaml and set bind and port, and then activate
and start the service using:

sysrc go_cve_dictionary_enable="YES"
service %%PORTNAME%% start
