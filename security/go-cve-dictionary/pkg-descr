go-cve-dictionary builds a a local copy of the National Vulnerabilities
Database(NVD) and Japan Vulnerability Notes(JVN). NVD and JVN contain security
vulnerabilities according to their CVE identifiers including exhaustive
information and a risk score. The local copy is generated in a database, using
sqlite3, postgres or mysql.  A server is included for easy querying.

This program is tightly related to security/vuls, a client binary that is used
to report about known vulnerabilities in packages. vuls uses the
go-cve-dictionary service when reporting about problems.
