NOTE: easyrsa will require you to initialize a PKI upon first use.

ONLY for the very first run for a new PKI, do something such as this,
assuming you will have its data in $HOME/my_new_pki:

  easyrsa --pki-dir=$HOME/my_new_pki init-pki # DANGEROUS - DESTROYS ~/my_new_pki

See %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/easy-rsa/README.quickstart.md for further information.

An on-line help is available, you can run:

  easyrsa help          # for help on commands
  easyrsa help options  # for help on options

**** SECURITY WARNING FOR PAST security/easy-rsa versions ****
**** easyrsa may have encrypted your CA private key with a weak cipher

Per CVE-2024-13454, Easy-RSA 3.0.5 inclusively up to and including 3.1.7,
when used with OpenSSL 3, may have accidentally encrypted the CA private
key with a weak cipher, des-ede3-cbc, instead of the intended aes-256-cbc,
when a CA was created with the   easyrsa build-ca   command.

Such mistakes cannot be corrected by upgrading Easy-RSA alone.

The standing recommendation for CA private keys is to 
re-encrypt the CA private keys with the aes-256-cbc cipher,
by using the   easyrsa set-pass ca   command.
