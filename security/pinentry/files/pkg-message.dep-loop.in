  message: <<EOM
Due to a dependency loop, you must install security/%%PKGNAME%% manually.
A symlink has been created for you so that %%PKGNAME%% will be the default
pinentry binary after you install it, but bear in mind that the package system
will not keep track of this dependency.

You may install %%PKGNAME%% with one of the following commands:

# pkg install security/%%PKGNAME%%
  or
# make -C /usr/ports/security/%%PKGNAME%% install clean
EOM
}
{ type: remove
  message: <<EOM
The pinentry package has been removed. If you no longer plan on using this
package, you may remove the %%PKGNAME%% package as well.

You may remove the %%PKGNAME%% package with the following command:

# pkg delete %%PKGNAME%%
EOM
}
