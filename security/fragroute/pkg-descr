"Fragroute intercepts, modifies, and rewrites egress traffic destined
for a specified host, implementing most of the attacks described in the
Secure Networks "Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding
Network Intrusion Detection" paper of January 1998.

It features a simple ruleset language to delay, duplicate, drop,
fragment, overlap, print, reorder, segment, source-route, or otherwise
monkey with all outbound packets destined for a target host, with
minimal support for randomized or probabilistic behaviour.

This tool was written in good faith to aid in the testing of network
intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and basic TCP/IP stack
behaviour. Please do not abuse this software."
