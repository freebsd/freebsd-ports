The xcalendar is a simple interactive calendar program with a notebook 
capability. It is built on the X Toolkit and the Athena Widgets.

Just type `xcalendar [month [year]]' on command line.
If month and year are not provided on the command line they are 
assumed to be current.

Note: This program is internationalized but only
app-defaults files for English (C) and Japanese (ja_JP.eucJP) are included.
Let's add another locales!
