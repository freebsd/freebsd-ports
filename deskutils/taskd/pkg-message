taskd requires user directed configuration prior to use.

See taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/configure.html for configuration
information. The generate script has been installed to
/usr/local/share/taskd.

After completing configuration to start taskd at system startup add
taskd_enable="YES" to rc.conf. If you configured taskd with a TASKDDATA
other than /var/db/taskd you will also need to set taskd_data in rc.conf
to that path.

The rc script will start taskd as the unprivileged user taskd, this
requires that your TASKDDATA directory and /var/log/taskd.log be owned
by taskd:taskd. If you prefer to use another user specify this in
rc.conf using taskd_user.

To add users see: taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/user.html

To configure taskwarrior to use your taskd server see:
taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/taskwarrior.html
