gDesklets provides an advanced architecture for desktop applets -- tiny displays
sitting on your desktop in a symbiotic relationship of eye candy and usefulness.

Populate your desktop with status meters, icon bars, weather sensors, news
tickers... whatever you can imagine! Virtually anything is possible and maybe
even available some day.
