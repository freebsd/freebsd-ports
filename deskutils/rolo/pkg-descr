Rolo keeps track of your contacts and display them to you with a text-based
menu. Rolo strives to be a well-constructed tool for complimenting text-based
email programs-such as mutt. It utilizes the vCard version 3.0 format for
storing its contacts and it interfaces with the end-user through a NCurses
front-end.
