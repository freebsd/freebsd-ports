Griffith is a movie collection manager application. Adding items to the
movie collection is as quick and easy as typing the film title and
selecting a supported source. Griffith will then try to fetch all the
related information from the Web.

  plug-in
* Integrates well with a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite3 used by
  default) to keep tabs on your library
* Can backup/restore your database
* Exports to CSV, PDF, XML and HTML files
* Imports from CSV files
* Generates PDF from cover art
* Keeps track of your films that are out on loan
* Enables you to sort/filter your library
