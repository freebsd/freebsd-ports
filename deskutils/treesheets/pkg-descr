The ultimate replacement for spreadsheets, mind mappers, outliners, PIMs, text
editors and small databases.

Suitable for any kind of data organization, such as Todo lists, calendars,
project management, brainstorming, organizing ideas, planning, requirements
gathering, presentation of information, etc.

It's like a spreadsheet, immediately familiar, but much more suitable for
complex data because it's hierarchical.
It's like a mind mapper, but more organized and compact.
It's like an outliner, but in more than one dimension.
It's like a text editor, but with structure.
