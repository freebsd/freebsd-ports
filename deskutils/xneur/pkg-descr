In-place converter of text typed in with a wrong keyboard layout. When users
work in multilingual environment (e.g. Russian+English), they sometimes type
in text with wrong keyboard layout. In auto mode XNeur can automatically
detect language of a word user typed, switch keyboard layout and convert the
word from one keyboard layout into another. In manual mode user has ability
to convert last typed word or some selected text using hot keys. The idea of
this utility is similar to Punto Switcher for Windows. For now XNeur support
English, Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, French, Romanian, Bulgarian, Czech,
Greek, Estonian, Armenian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Poland, Spanish and Uzbek
languages.
