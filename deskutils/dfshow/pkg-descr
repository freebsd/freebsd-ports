dfshow is a set of applications which display files and directories.

The following programs are included:
* sf
  The Show File application displays a text file on screen and allows for easy
  navigation. The program can be invoked by the sf command for a specific file
  or from the show application.

* show
  The Show Directory application displays all or some of the names of the files
  on a system with information about the files. From this program, files can be
  copied, deleted, displayed, edited (in your favorite editor), or renamed by
  simply positioning the cursor to the desired file name and using a single
  command character. The application is invoked by the show command similar to
  the standard ls command.
