Notes:

1.  Sugar Community Edition requires that you increase the default PHP
    memory limit from 8Mb to 64Mb in the php.ini file.  You should edit this
    file and ensure that the memory_limit parameter should be set to 64Mb or
    greater:

memory_limit = 64M	; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume

2.  Sugar Community Edition requires the following three parameters to be set
    in your php.ini.

allow_call_time_pass_reference = Off
safe_mode = Off		; disable "safe mode"
session.save_path = "/tmp"

    While Sugar Community Edition will work (albeit inefficiently) with
    allow_call_time_pass_reference enabled, safe_mode must be disabled to
    allow the system to work at all.  For more information on why these
    parameters are unnecessary, please see the PHP manual.

3.  In order to get Apache or your preferred web server to recognise Sugar
    Community Edition's location on your disk, you'll need to put the
    following line (or the equivalent) into the web server configuration:

Alias /sugarcrm %%WWWDIR%%
<Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
	AllowOverride None
	Require all granted
</Directory>

4.  For full information on how to get the best out of Sugar Community
    Edition, please see the documentation on the web:

5.  Enjoy!
