anniversaries from your KDE addressbook. It uses the KDE
addressbook API to access the addressbook data. So you
can use your favourite addressbook frontend to manage your
friends addresses, birthdays and anniversaries.

Features:

    * support for birthdays and anniversaries from kaddressbook
    * configurable notification time (past and future events supported)
    * highlighting of most urgent events with configurable color
    * shows remaining days to every event
    * shows age of a person having birthday or years of anniversary
