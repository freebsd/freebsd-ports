Make sure that the freetype module is loaded.  If it is not, add the following
line to the "Modules" section of your X Windows configuration file:

        Load "freetype"

Add the following line to the "Files" section of X Windows configuration file:

        FontPath "%%PREFIX%%/%%FONTSDIR%%/"

For a working script you must define, in a user specific config file, a partner
id and registration code for the weather.com xoap service. For this purpose
the config file should be copied to ~/.conkyForecast.config and setup as
required.

To copy and edit the config, using the command line, run:

	cp %%DATADIR%%/conkyForecast.config ~/.conkyForecast.config
