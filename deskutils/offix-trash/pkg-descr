This is Trash from OffiX, for use with applications which support the
OffiX DND protocol.

Trash is a black-hole intended to be used with "files". Every file dropped
on trash will be moved to a temporary hidden directory. If you want, the
"delete all" button will remove the files in trash from your disk forever.
The good things is that the files in trash can be recovered (undeleted).

Suggestion: call it iconic ("trash -ic") when you use it.
