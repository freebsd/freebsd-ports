Zim - A Desktop Wiki Editor

Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki
pages. Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and
images. Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and
can have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a
nonexistent page. All data is stored in plain text files with wiki
formatting. Various plugins provide additional functionality, like a
task list manager, an equation editor, a tray icon, and support for
version control.

Zim can be used to:
* Keep an archive of notes
* Take notes during meetings or lectures
* Organize task lists
* Draft blog entries and emails
* Do brainstorming
