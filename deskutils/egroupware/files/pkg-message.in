POST-INSTALL CONFIGURATION FOR eGroupware


Make sure in your php.ini session.save_path='/tmp' is writable
upload_max_filesize >= 8M

1) Create a user and a database for eGroupware to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).
   It doesn't matter what the database or user names are,
   as this will be configured in a later step.

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   ### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30 or later.
   Alias /eg %%PREFIX%%/%%EG_DIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%EG_DIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%EG_DATA%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Deny from all
   </Directory>

3) Visit your eGroupware site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/eg/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config file and then
   setting up eGroupware, creating an admin account, etc.

4) When you come to the setup page,please set the files'
and backup's full path with:
   %%PREFIX%%/%%EG_DATA%%/files
   %%PREFIX%%/%%EG_DATA%%/backup
