"The Goo" helps you stick "Things" together in your working environment.

Things include Perl modules, Perl scripts, log files, javascripts,
configuration files, database tables, templates etc.

The Goo records a "Trail" as you jump quickly from Thing to Thing in a
simple, text-based console. It remembers how you associate Things in your
environment.

Accelerate your work by quickly traversing the Trail of associations
between Things.
