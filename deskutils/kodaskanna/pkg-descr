Kodaskanna is a utility for reading data from 1D/2D codes (e.g. QR 
codes or bar codes) and making the data available for further processing.

This initial 0.1.0 release supports scanning codes in static images. The image 
input files (can be also non-local ones) can be either passed as argument on 
the command line or manually selected via a file picker, pasted from the 
clipboard or dropped by DnD. The extracted content can then be exported to the 
clipboard or as a file. The version also provides integration via the Dolphin 
context menu for image files and by a KDE Purpose "Export" plugin.
