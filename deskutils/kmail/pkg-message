===============================================================================

KDE Applications versions of Akonadi, KMail, and Kontact use large
messages on the local machine. The default size on FreeBSD is too
small, which causes local connection problems, and Akonadi-based
applications will be flaky (e.g. mailboxes do not display, messages
cannot be found). Increasing the buffer size is recommended:

	sysctl net.local.stream.recvspace=65536
	sysctl net.local.stream.sendspace=65536
