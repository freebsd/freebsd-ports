GWorkspace is the official GNUstep workspace manager. It is a clone of
NeXT's workspace manager and already ready for daily usage. GWorkspace is
probably one of the most useful and usable workspace managers available on
any platform, owing to its well-designed interface and the natural,
consistent design that it inherits from the GNUstep framework.
