FreeBSD/amd64 users:
You need to manually install Wine 32bit binary from:
http://www.mediafire.com/wine_fbsd64

For more info about running wine on FreeBSD please see:
http://wiki.freebsd.org/Wine

This program will attempt to obtain some system information by accessing files
in procfs. You must mount procfs filesystem for this to work correctly.
This can be accomplished by adding the following line to your /etc/fstab file:

# Device                Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
proc                    /proc           procfs  rw              0       0

and then, as root, executing the command:

mount /proc

Also you need passwordless sudo for mdconfig, mount_cd9660, umount commands for
work with ISO images
