The gnome-main-menu is a set of two utilities.  A gnome-panel applet similar
to the traditional main-menu but a few addtions and changes.  In particular the
gnome-main-menu does not provide direct access to all the applications on the
system, but rather displays user specified "favorites" and recently launched
applications.

Access to all the applications is made through the second of the three
utilities, the application-browser, which is a larger format application than
that the traditional main-menu which is managed by the window manager to allow
for resizing, etc.
