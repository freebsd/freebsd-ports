NOTE: Calibre requires Hal to be running for access to devices.  The user who
is running Calibre also needs to be able to mount devices.  For non-root users,
this means modifying %%PREFIX%%/etc/PolicyKit/PolicyKit.conf and adding the
policy there.

To allow a single user named "example" to mount removable devices, add the
following:

  <match action="org.freedesktop.hal.storage.mount-removable">
    <match user="example">
      <return result="yes" />
    </match>
  </match>

Additional users will each need their own <match user="user"> block with a
"yes" return result.

To permit all accounts to mount removable devices (allowing a denial of access
attack) add the following:

  <match action="org.freedesktop.hal.storage.mount-removable">
    <return result="yes" />
  </match>

If you are using an Android device as your e-book reader, please note
that the stock Google Books app uses a storage format that is not
supported by calibre.  The calibre FAQ recommends that either of the
free apps Aldiko or WordPlayer are used instead.
