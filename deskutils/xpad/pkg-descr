xpad is a sticky note application written using GTK+ 2.0 that strives to be
simple, fault-tolerant, and customizable. xpad consists of independent pad
windows; each is basically a text box in which notes can be written. Despite
being called xpad, all that is needed to run or compile it is the GTK+ 2.0
libraries. Here is a list of major features in the current xpad stable
release:

  * GTK+ 2.0 powered text view.
  * Fault tolerant. All information is kept on the hard drive, not memory.
  * xpad is very customizable. The color scheme (text, background, and window
    borders) and the font can be changed.
  * A customizable toolbar puts the most frequently used commands at your
    fingertips.
  * Support for the X session management protocol.
  * Support for the www.freedesktop.org system tray proposal.
