Charm is a program for FreeBSD, OS X, Linux and Windows that helps to keep
track of time. It is built around two major ideas - tasks and events. Tasks
are the things time is spend on, repeatedly. For example, ironing
laundry is a task. The laundry done for two hours on last Tuesday is an
event in that task. When doing laundry multiple times, the events will
be accumulated, and can later be printed in activity reports or weekly
time sheets. So in case laundry would be done for three hours on
Wednesday again, the activity report for the "Ironing Laundry" task
would list the event on tuesday, the event on wednesday and a total of
five hours.
