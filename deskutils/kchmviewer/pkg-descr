KchmViewer is a chm (MS HTML help file format) viewer. Unlike most existing
CHM viewers for Unix, it uses Trolltech's Qt widget library, and does not
depend on KDE or Gnome. However, it may be compiled with full KDE support,
including KDE widgets and KIO/KHTML.

The main advantage of KchmViewer is non-english language support. Unlike
others, KchmViewer in most cases correctly detects help file encoding,
correctly shows tables of context of russian, korean, chinese and japanese
help files, and correctly searches in non-english help files.
