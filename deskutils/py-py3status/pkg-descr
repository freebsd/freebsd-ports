py3status is an extensible i3status wrapper written in python.

You can take control of your i3bar easily by:

   * using one of the available modules shipped with py3status
   * grouping multiple modules and automatically or manually cycle their display
   * writing your own modules and have their output displayed on your bar
   * handling click events on your i3bar and play with them in no time
   * seeing your clock tick every second whatever your i3status interval
