MenuMaker is application finding and menu generation utility. It is capable of
finding lots of installed programs and generating the root menu consistent
across all supported X window managers, so one will get (almost) the same menu
no matter what WM is currently used. It is pure Python application hence it
runs on every relevant system.

Supported X window managers:

- BlackBox
- Deskmenu
- FluxBox
- IceWM
- OpenBox, version 3
- PekWM
- WindowMaker
- XFCE, version 4

It also reads Freedesktop.org's .desktop files.
