VYM  (View Your Mind) is a tool to generate and manipulate maps which
show your thoughts. Such maps can help you to improve your creativity
and effectivity. You can use them for time management, to organize
tasks, to get an overview over complex contexts, to sort your ideas
etc. Some people even think it is fun to work with such maps...
