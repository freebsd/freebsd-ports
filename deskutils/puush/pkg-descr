Use keyboard shortcuts gestures to quickly capture any portion
of your screen. These screenshots are near-instantly puush'd,
leaving behind a short URL in your clipboard, perfect for sharing.
Paste these easily into your Twitter, IRC or IM clients. Share
them with the world or make them private, for your eyes only.
