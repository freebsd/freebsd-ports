Unix Version of the Windowsprogram CueCards.

General Idea: With TuxCards it is possible to create as many different
entries or notes as you wish. Everytime you add a new one and you
think your new entry belongs to the same topic as notes you already
have, then you may decide to group them and to create a kind of
"folder" where you store them all together. Just the same like you
would put your books and paperwork from your job together in one
place and not to the garden utilities (unless you work as a gardener)..

With TuxCards you have a tool at your hand to enter and manage every
kind of notes and ideas in a structured manner. This makes it much
more easier to find them as you are in need.
