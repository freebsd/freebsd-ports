This plugin displays the current keyboard layout, and refreshes when
layout changes. Also the layout can be switched by simply clicking on
the plugin. The new version can display the layout as text label and
also as an image of the corresponding country's flag. If the flag
image is unavailable then the plugin falls back to displaying text
label for that layout.

This plugin is used along with the XKB extension. For now the keyboard
layouts cannot be configured from the plugin itself, they should be
set in the XF86Config file or some other way (e.g. setxkbmap).
