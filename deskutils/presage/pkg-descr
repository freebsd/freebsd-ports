Presage is an intelligent predictive text entry system.

Presage (formerly known as Soothsayer) generates predictions by modelling
natural language as a combination of redundant information sources. Presage
computes probabilities for words which are most likely to be entered next
by merging predictions generated by the different predictive algorithms.

Presage's modular and extensible architecture allows its language model to
be extended and customized to utilize statistical, syntactic, and semantic
predictive algorithms.
