Org-mode is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, and
doing project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

Org-mode develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
information about projects as plain text. Org-mode is implemented on
top of outline-mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
large files well structured. Visibility cycling and structure editing
help to work with the tree. Tables are easily created with a built-in
table editor. Org-mode supports ToDo items, deadlines, time stamps,
and scheduling. It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda. Plain
text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet messages, BBDB
entries, and any files related to the projects. For printing and
sharing of notes, an Org-mode file can be exported as a structured
ASCII file, or as HTML.
