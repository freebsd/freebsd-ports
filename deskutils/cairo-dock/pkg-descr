Cairo-Dock is a light and eye-candy dock to launch your programs easily. It uses
Cairo / OpenGL to render nice graphics (many in correlation with Compiz) with
hardware acceleration. It's fully configurable and customizable and can be a
taskbar too. You can easily plug applets into it or in a desklet mode.
