Docear (pronounced dog-ear) integrates everything you need to search,
organize and create academic literature in a single application: a
digital library, reference manager, PDF and file manager, note taking
and mind mapping.  And the best: Docear works seamlessly with many
existing tools like Mendeley, Microsoft Word, and Foxit Reader.
