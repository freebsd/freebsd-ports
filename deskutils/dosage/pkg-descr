Dosage is an application designed to keep a local "mirror" of specific web
comics, and other picture-based content such as Picture of the Day sites,
with a variety of options for updating and maintaining comics.
Dosage supports a recursive "catch-up" method, where it traverses a comic
by essentially "visiting" previous comics and picking out the comics.
Dosage is written entirely in Python, and relies on regular expressions to
do most of the grunt work.
