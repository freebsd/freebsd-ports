trash-cli trashes files recording the original path, deletion date, and
permissions. It uses the same trashcan used by KDE, GNOME, and XFCE, but you
can invoke it from the command line (and scripts).

It provides these commands:

trash-put           trash files and directories.
trash-empty         empty the trashcan(s).
trash-list          list trashed files.
trash-restore       restore a trashed file.
trash-rm            remove individual files from the trashcan.
