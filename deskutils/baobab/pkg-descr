Disk Usage Analyzer is a graphical application to analyse disk usage in any
Gnome environment. Disk Usage Analyzer can easily scan device volumes or a
specific user-requested directory branch (local or remote).

Once the scan is complete Disk Usage Analyzer provides a graphical
representation of each selected folder.
