"LiveJournal.com... because you like to think other people care." LogJam is
a GTK2 client for the LiveJournal API.  It sits unobtrusively in the corner
of your screen, waiting for you to have something worthwhile to tell the
world.  It can spellcheck with gtkspell and offers preview capabilities
using gtkhtml3.  It will interface with any site running LiveJournal, not
just www.livejournal.com, and can create offline copies of your journal.
