Wyrd is a text-based front-end to Remind, a sophisticated calendar and alarm
program. Remind's power lies in its programmability, and Wyrd does not hide
this capability behind flashy GUI dialogs. Rather, Wyrd is designed to make
you more efficient at editing your reminder files directly. It also offers a
scrollable timetable suitable for visualizing your schedule at a glance.

Unlike most of the calendar applications available today, Wyrd is designed to
be both lightweight and fast. Startup time is negligible, UI navigation is
instantaneous, and the wyrd process typically consumes less than 2MB of
resident memory.
