MPlayerThumbs is a thumbnail generator for all KDE file managers (konqueror,
dolphin, ...)  It needs mplayer (of course) to generate thumbnails, and it
contains no linking to any library, so in a x86_64 system you can freely use the
32bit mplayer binary with win32codecs by configuring the application launching
the mplayerthumbsconfig helper application.
