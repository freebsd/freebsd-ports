gpicker is a program that allows you to quickly and conveniently pick file
in a (possibly very large) project. You type significant letters of file name
(typically from the start of words) and gpicker provides you with a list of
files you most likely mean to pick. The program filters and orders project's
list of files in real-time as you type.
