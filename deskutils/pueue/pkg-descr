Pueue is a command-line task management tool for sequential and parallel
execution of long-running tasks.

Simply put, it's a tool that processes a queue of shell commands. On top of
that, there are a lot of convenient features and abstractions.

Since Pueue is not bound to any terminal, you can control your tasks from any
terminal on the same machine. The queue will be continuously processed, even
if you no longer have any active ssh sessions.
