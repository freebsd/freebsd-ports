Xwrits reminds you to take wrist breaks, which will hopefully help you
prevent repetitive stress injury. It pops up an X window when you
should rest; you click on that window, then take a break.

Xwrits's graphics are brightly colored pictures of a wrist and the
attached hand. The wrist clenches and stretches ``as if in pain'' when
you should rest, slumps relaxed during the break, and points forward
valiantly when the break is over. It is trapped behind bars while the
keyboard is locked. Other gestures are included.
