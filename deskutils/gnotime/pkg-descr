The Gnome Time Tracker is a to-do list/diary/journal tool that can
track the amount of time spent on projects, and, among other things,
generate reports and invoices based on that time. It can be used
to keep shopping lists, organize ideas, track bug reports, keep a
diary of activities, provide weekly status reports to management,
and even works as a consultant billing system.
