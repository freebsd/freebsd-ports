The rux is a simple and at the same time powerful utility for texts recoding
from one encoding to another. At present time several the most popular Cyrillic
code pages such as utf-8, koi8-r, cp866, cp1251, iso8859-5 and mac-cyrillic are
supported. Also rux gives the opportunity to recode box- drawing characters,
which exists in some Cyrillic code pages, to replace them by their non-graphic
analogues ('-', '+', etc.).

Besides, the rux can detect a code page of the input files automatically.

Usually rux is used without any options because some values are accepted
by default. There are -o koi8-r, -e, -t.

The expectancy value of the presence of every Cyrillic characters in the
some text were taken from the dump of Russian translation of the `FreeBSD
Handbook'.
