from the man page:

	gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
	complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
	other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a .PNG file.
	This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where .PNG
	is the format used for inline images.

	gd is not a paint program. [...]

	gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics operation. It
	is not necessary or desirable for gd to become a kitchen-sink graphics
	package, but version 1.3 incorporates most of the commonly requested
	features for an 8-bit 2D package. Support for scalable fonts, and 
	truecolor images, JPEG and PNG is planned for version 2.0.
[...]
	gd was written by Thomas Boutell and is currently distributed by 
	boutell.com, Inc.
