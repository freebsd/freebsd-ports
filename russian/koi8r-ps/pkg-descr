This port tries to follow numerous  suggestions and HOWTOs posted on the
web  about  printing and  viewing  PostScript  files containing  Russian
characters (in KOI8 encoding, are there others?).

In installs the fonts taken from
	ftp://ftp.kapella.gpi.ru/pub/cyrillic/psfonts/

into   their    own   ${PREFIX}/CyrPS   directory,   and    places   the
infonts.dir/fonts.scale there for your X-server's perusal.

If you  happen to have  ghostscript installed,  it will also  append its
Fontmap file to print/display with this fonts by default.

Note, however, that this will NOT make your PostScript printers print in
Russian, since they have their own PostScript interpreters built in. Use
`koify' port for to deal with those.
