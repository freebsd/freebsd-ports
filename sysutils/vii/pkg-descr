Vii (pronounced seven) is a simple program which accepts input from the
standard input and displays pages of the input on the terminal.

These pages are delimited by form-feeds (or EOF). The display can be scrolled
if the output is wider or longer than the screen.

Vii can also repeatedly execute a command (at a configurable interval) and the
most recent output is displayed. This is useful for status monitoring where the
command itself does not have a repeatable or curses interface.
