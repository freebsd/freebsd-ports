Zelta is a suite of tools offering a streamlined approach to managing
ZFS snapshot replication across systems. It's built with the intention
of simplifying complex ZFS functions into safe and user-friendly
commands while also being the foundation for large-scale backup
and failover environments. It's easy and accessible while working
with most UNIX and UNIX-like base systems without additional packages.
It's optimized for environments with strict permission separation,
and integrates well into many types of existing ZFS workflows.
