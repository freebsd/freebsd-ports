SCSI / firewire harddrive spindown daemon

This is a small program for handling automated spinning down of
SCSI harddrives. With SCSI devices it is not as common to spindown
for power management purposes as for ATA however it might be required
to spin down a disk contained in a firewire enclosure for instance.
