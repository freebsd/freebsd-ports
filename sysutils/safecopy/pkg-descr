Safecopy is a data recovery tool which tries to extract as much data as 
possible from a problematic (i.e. damaged sectors) source - like floppy drives,
hard disk partitions, CDs, tape devices etc, ... , where other tools like dd 
would fail due to I/O errors.
Safecopy includes a low level IO layer to read CDROM disks in raw mode, and 
issue device resets and other helpful low level operations on a number of other
device classes.
The project also includes a device simulator which can be used to simulate bad 
media for testing and benchmarking safecopy as well as other data rescue tools.
