Python client for nomad (WWW: http://www.nomadproject.io)

Nomad is a tool for managing a cluster of machines and running
applications on them.
Nomad abstracts away machines and the location of applications,
and instead enables users to declare what they want to run and
Nomad handles where they should run and how to run them.
