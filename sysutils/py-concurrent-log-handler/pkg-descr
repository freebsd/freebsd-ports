This package provides an additional log handler for Python's standard logging
package (PEP 282). This handler will write log events to a log file which is
rotated when the log file reaches a certain size.  Multiple processes can
safely write to the same log file concurrently. Rotated logs can be gzipped
if desired. Both Windows and POSIX systems are supported.  An optional threaded
queue logging handler is provided to perform logging in the background.

This is a fork of Lowell Alleman's ConcurrentLogHandler 0.9.1 which fixes
a hanging/deadlocking problem.
