# Box Backup monthly store compare
#
# Add the following to /etc/periodic.conf to enable the monthly compare:
#  monthly_boxbackup_compare_enable="YES"
#
# By default the script will run "compare -aq". If you want to change this to
# run a full compare, add the following to periodic.conf:
#  monthly_boxbackup_compare_args="-a"
#
# NOTE: This script will cause the monthly periodic(8) run to take much longer
# than usual, depending on the size of your backup store.
#
# If you wish to run this independently of the monthly job, you can create a
# new periodic entry as follows:
#
#  # mkdir /usr/local/etc/periodic/boxbackup
#  # mv /usr/local/etc/periodic/monthly/999.boxbackup \
#       /usr/local/etc/periodic/boxbackup/100.compare
#
# Then add the following to /etc/crontab:
# 30      5       1       *       *       root    periodic boxbackup
#
# (adjust the timings as necessary)
#
# You may also wish to add boxbackup_output="root" to periodic.conf so that
# mail comes from periodic rather than cron.
