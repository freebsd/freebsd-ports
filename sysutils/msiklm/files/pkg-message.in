 A sample devd(8) configuration file has been installed as:
   %%PREFIX%%/etc/devd/msiklm.conf.sample

 You may want to copy this file to:
   %%PREFIX%%/etc/devd/msiklm.conf
 and configure it to your liking if you want msiklm to automatically
 set your keyboard backlight to a default upon system boot/resume.
