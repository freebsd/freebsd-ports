bareos server was installed

1) Sample files are installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/ and
   %%PREFIX%%/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.d/ directories

2) Add bareos_dir_enable="YES" and bareos_sd_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf.

3) If you want to retain old configuration scheme, you must add the following
   to /etc/rc.conf

  bareos_dir_config="%%PREFIX%%/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.conf"
  bareos_sd_config="%%PREFIX%%/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.conf"

4) Important information about new version of bareos can be found in the
   ReleaseNotes.

   https://github.com/bareos/bareos/blob/master/README.md

NOTE:

An auto-changer manipulation script based on FreeBSDs
chio command is included and installed at

  %%PREFIX%%/sbin/chio-bareos

Please have a look at it if you want to use an
autochanger. You have to configure the usage in

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.conf or
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/storage/

Take care of correct permissions for changer and
tape device (e.g. /dev/ch0 and /dev/n[r]sa0) i.e.
they must be accessible by user bareos.

Due to lack of some features in the FreeBSD tape driver
implementation you MUST add some OS dependent options to
the bareos-sd.conf file:

  Hardware End of Medium = no;
  Backward Space Record  = no;
  Backward Space File    = no;

With 2 filemarks at EOT (see man mt):
  Fast Forward Space File = no;
  BSF at EOM = yes;
  TWO EOF    = yes;

With 1 filemarks at EOT (see man mt):
  Fast Forward Space File = yes;
  BSF at EOM = no;
  TWO EOF   = no;

NOTE: YOU CAN SWITCH EOT model ONLY when starting
      from scratch with EMPTY tapes.

It is also important that all the scripts accessed
by RunBeforeJob and RunAfterJob will be executed by
the user bareos.  Check your permissions.

For USB support read the bareos manual. It could be necessary
to configure/compile a new kernel.

Look at %%PREFIX%%/lib/bareos/scripts/update_bareos_tables for
database update procedure.

If you are using sqlite you need to run the make_sqlite_tables script as
the bareos user. Do this using 'sudo su -m bareos'.
