This is a tool to generate flash images for the embedded ubiquiti devices.
It includes support for:

* Routerstation
* Routerstation Pro
* LS-SR71
* XS-2 (?)
* XS-5 (?)
* XS2-8 (?)
* XM (?)

This particular tool is patched to build FreeBSD images rather than the
default Linux-centric images. The only change is the addition of
a separate "execute address" field, rather than assuming the kernel load
address is the kernel execute address.
