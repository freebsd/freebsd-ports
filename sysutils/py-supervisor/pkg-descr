Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users 
to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like 
operating systems.

It shares some of the same goals of programs like launchd, 
daemontools, and runit. Unlike some of these programs, it is 
not meant to be run as a substitute for init as "process id 1". 
Instead it is meant to be used to control processes related to 
a project or a customer, and is meant to start like any 
other program at boot time.
