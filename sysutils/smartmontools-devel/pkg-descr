The smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and smartd) 
to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis 
and Reporting Technology System (S.M.A.R.T.) built into most modern ATA and 
SCSI hard disks.  It is derived from the smartsuite package, and includes 
support for ATA/ATAPI-5 disks.
