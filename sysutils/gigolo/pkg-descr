Gigolo is a frontend to easily manage connections to local and
remote filesystems using GIO/GVfs. It allows you to
quickly connect/mount a remote filesystem and manage bookmarks of such.

It is part of the Xfce Goodies project and the Subversion respository
is hosted on the Xfce servers though it does not have any hard
Xfce dependencies and can be used on other desktop environments as well.
The only hard dependency is GTK2.
