The du2ps reads output of du(1), then generates a figure of
hierarchical structure and utilization of each directory.

The du2ps is a similar program to xdu, but it produces result as
a PostScript file.

The default paper is ISO A4, but you can select Letter or ISO A3/B4/B5.
You can also specify font name, font size, number of columns and other
options.
