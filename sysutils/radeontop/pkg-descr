RadeonTop is a small utility which allows one to monitor the utilization of
AMD Radeon GPUs starting from the r600 series and newer, using undocumented
performance counters in the hardware.

It displays the utilization of the graphics pipe, event engine, vertex
cache, vertex group and tesselator, texture addresser and cache, the shader
units, and more, both with a relative percent value as well as a colorful
bar diagram (ncurses-based).

Total GPU utilization is also valid for OpenCL loads; other values are only
useful in GL loads.
