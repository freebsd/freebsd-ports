Fpart is a tool that helps you sort files and pack them into bags
("partitions"). It is developped in C and available under the BSD license.

It splits a list of directories and files into a certain number of partitions,
trying to produce partitions with the same size and number of files.  It can
also produce partitions with a given number of files or a limited size.
