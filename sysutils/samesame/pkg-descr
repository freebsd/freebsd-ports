Samesame is a collection of tools that fall in to the categorie of file
management software. These tools will prevent that you need to delete
files or buy more disk space. Instead they solve low disk space problems
by linking identical files together and thus free up waisted disk space.

This collaction was inspired by the application samefile written by Jens
Schweikhardt. The collection comes with its own version of samefile that
is noticeable faster and is able to process a much larger file list.

This port contains the applications: samefile, samelink and samearchive.
The latter does the same as samefile but for file-based archives. The
port also contains a version that uses just 10% of the resources compared
to samearchive. The application samelink hard link identical files for you.

Typical usage would be:

   find / | samefile -i | samelink

This would search for identical files and clean up wasted disk space by
linking them together. Add the option -n after samelink for a dry-run.
