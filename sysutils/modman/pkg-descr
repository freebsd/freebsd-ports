Developing extensions for software that doesn't allow you to separate
your files from core files, and keeping that extension under version
control and making it easy to deploy is now much, much easier.
Development of this script was inspired by Magento which forces you
to mix your extension files all throughout the core code directories.
With modman, you can specify in a text file where you want your
directories and files to be mapped to, and it will maintain symlinks
for you so that your code is easy to hack and deploy.
