Exa is a modern replacement for ls.  It uses colours for information
by default, helping you distinguish between many types of files, such
as whether you are the owner, or in the owning group.  It also has
extra features not present in the original ls, such as viewing the Git
status for a directory, or recursing into directories with a tree
view.  Exa is written in Rust, so it's small, fast, and portable.
