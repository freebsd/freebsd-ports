This is the UFS2 version of ffsrecov, heavily (and I do mean _heavily_)
based on John-Mark Gurney's program of the same name. It does basically
the same thing, only it's a little more resistant to crashes caused by
bad pointers, offsets and the like, and it does a little more than his
did. Don't contact him for problems with this program, it's definitely
_my_ fault if it breaks.

This program is not ready for prime time. It has some shortfalls, it
has a bunch of new options that are mostly undocumented and the manpage
could stand to be rewritten. One _good_ thing is that it now uses the
libufs library and is therefore not as dependent on carrying around
low-level code.

On the other hand, it worked for me.  Using this tool, I was able to
recover almost all of a several-hundred-gigabyte file system that had
been stomped by a misconfigured RAID controller. (That's why I wrote the
thing in the first place, in fact.)  With the right knowledge and a lot
of patience, it is possible to recover most or all of a trashed file
system, at least if it's not _too_ trashed.

I'm releasing it under the Berkeley two-clause license in the hope that
someone with more time will pick it up, polish it and make something a
little more useful out of it.
