gcombust is a GTK+ frontend for mkisofs and cdrecord.

At this moment every release of gcombust isn't always very well tested; it
would probably be wise to test it with the -dummy option at first to check that
I haven't made any stupid errors. Also, it prints the command it's executing to
stdout so you can look at it and maybe spot errors.

I love to recieve feedback/comments/ideas/bugreports at:
	jmunsin@iki.fi (jmunsin@abo.fi)

NOTE: If you decide to do a NLS translation of gcombust, it might be a good
	idea to mail me about it to make sure noone else is doing one for the
	same language.
