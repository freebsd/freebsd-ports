U-Boot loader for NanoPi Neo Air.

To install this bootloader, follow the instructions in
 http://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable_SD_card#Bootloader

This version is patched so that:
 * ELF and API features are enabled.
 * The distroboot command knows how to load FreeBSD loader(8)
 * By default, it loads ubldr.bin (PIE) from file ubldr.bin on the FAT
   partition to address 0x42000000, and launches it. If ubldr.bin is
   not found, it falls back on ubldr
