    message: <<EOM
Slurm has been installed.

Sample config:
  %%ETCDIR%%/slurm.conf.sample

Before starting services:
  - Copy and edit the sample to %%ETCDIR%%/slurm.conf
  - Create state dirs (already created in stage): /var/spool/slurmctld
  - Ensure munge is running and configured.

Services:
  - slurmctld (controller)
  - slurmd     (node daemon)

On FreeBSD, cgroups are typically not used. If slurmd/slurmctld complain
about cgroup initialization, set this in slurm.conf:

    ProctrackType=proctrack/linuxproc
    TaskPlugin=task/none
    CgroupPlugin=disabled

Then restart slurmctld/slurmd.
