Slurm is an open-source workload manager designed for *nux clusters of all
sizes. It provides three key functions. First it allocates exclusive and/or
non-exclusive access to resources (computer nodes) to users for some duration of
time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting,
executing, and monitoring work (typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated
nodes. Finally, it arbitrates contention for resources by managing a queue of
pending work.
