The PCI Utilities package contains various utilities dealing 
with the PCI bus, and also a library for portable access to 
PCI configuration registers. It includes `lspci' for listing 
all PCI devices (very useful for debugging of both kernel and 
device drivers) and `setpci' for manual configuration of PCI
devices.
