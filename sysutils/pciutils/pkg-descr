The PCI Utilities package contains various utilities dealing
with the PCI bus, and also a library for portable access to
PCI configuration registers. It includes `lspci' for listing
all PCI devices (very useful for debugging of both kernel and
device drivers) and `setpci' for manual configuration of PCI
devices.
