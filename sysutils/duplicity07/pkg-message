 The following backends are supported by duplicity itself, but will
 require manual installation of their respective dependencies because
 they are not yet available in the ports tree:

   - The Dropbox backend
   - The HSI backend
   - The mega backend for mega.co.nz
   - The swift backend for OpenStack Object Storage
   - The tahoe backend for Tahoe-LAFS

 Please refer to upstream duplicity documentation for information on
 the use of these backends.


 For gnupg 2 insert "pinentry-mode loopback" into ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
 and "allow-loopback-pinentry" into ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf



 Some fixes related to gnupg handling were made in v0.7.12.
