savelogs is a flexible and robust log file archival system. Its
logic is simple: move (rename) the log file, filter data from
the log file, store the log file in an archive (via tar or
gtar), and compress the archive (via gzip or compress). After
successful compression, the original log file is deleted.

All of the above phases are optional. This means that you may
simply delete files if you wish. Or you may simply compress
existing log files. Or you may move files and add them to a tar
file but leave the tar file uncompressed, etc. You pick ;o)

savelogs has many options yet retains a high degree of dwimitude.
