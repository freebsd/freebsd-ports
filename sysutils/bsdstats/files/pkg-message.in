You installed BSDstats: script reporting statistics about your machine.

To disable monthly reporting, add this line to /etc/periodic.conf:

To disable parts of reporting, add these lines to /etc/periodic.conf:

To limit which ports are being submitted:
	create %%PREFIX%%/etc/bsdstats.conf and list ports to report in
	the form ${category}/${portname}, one entry per line. It is also
	possible to use the special self explanatory keyword "all-ports".
Example:
	sysutils/bsdstats
	ports-mgmt/pkg

To enable reporting on bootup, add this line to /etc/rc.conf:
	bsdstats_enable="YES"

To run it manually any time:
	bsdstats-send
