execnet provides a share-nothing model with channel-send/receive communication
for distributing execution across many Python interpreters across version,
platform and network barriers. It has a minimal and fast API targetting the
following uses:

  * Distribute tasks to (many) local or remote CPUs
  * Write and deploy hybrid multi-process applications
  * Write scripts to administer multiple environments
