Dmidecode reports information about your system's hardware as described in your
system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard. This information typically
includes system manufacturer, model name, serial number, BIOS version, asset tag
as well as a lot of other details of varying level of interest and reliability
depending on the manufacturer. This will often include usage status for the CPU
sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, ISA) and memory module slots, and the
list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel, USB).
