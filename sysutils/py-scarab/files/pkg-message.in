Before you can manipulate PRs with this program in FreeBSD Bugzilla
you have to create an API key and copy it in your config file.

Login -> Preferences -> API keys -> Generate a new API key

The config file is probed from your home directory as ".scarabrc".
A sample scarabrc config file is located under %%EXAMPLESDIR%%.
