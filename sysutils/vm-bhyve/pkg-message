To enable vm-bhyve, please add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf,
depending on whether you are using ZFS storage or not. Please note
that the directory or dataset specified should already exist.

    vm_enable="YES"
    vm_dir="zfs:pool/dataset"

OR

    vm_enable="YES"
    vm_dir="/directory/path"

Then run 'vm init'.

If upgrading from 1.0 or earlier, please note that the 'guest'
configuration option is no longer used.

Guests that are not using UEFI boot will need either loader="grub"
or loader="bhyveload" in their configuration in order to make sure
the correct loader is used.
