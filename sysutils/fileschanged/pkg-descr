The fileschanged utility is a client to the FAM (File Alteration Monitor)
server that is now available in some distributions. Here's how the fileschanged
FAM client works: you give it some filenames on the command line and then it
monitors those files for changes. When it discovers that a file has changed
(or has been altered), it displays the filename on the standard-output.
