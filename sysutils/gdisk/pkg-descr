GPT fdisk (aka gdisk) is intended as a (somewhat) fdisk-workalike program for
GPT-partitioned disks. Specific advantages of gdisk, cgdisk and sgdisk include:

- Edit GUID partition table (GPT) definitions in Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X, or
  Windows
- Convert MBR to GPT or back without data loss
- Convert BSD disklabels to GPT without data loss
- Create hybrid MBR, which permits GPT-unaware OSes to access up to three GPT
  partitions on the disk
- Repair damaged GPT data structures
- The ability to specify sector-exact partition sizes
- Clear identification of the number of unallocated sectors on a disk
