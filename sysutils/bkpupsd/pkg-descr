bkpupsd - Back-UPS Pro. UPS daemon
----------------------------------

    This is a simple uninterruptible power source (UPS) daemon which 
supports APC Back-UPS Pro(TM) series.  The UPSd works as UPS driver, 
sensing line-failures, shutting down the system cleanly, and finally 
shutting down the UPS itself.  This UPSd provides only the "dumb mode",
and the advanced features are not supported.
