Snowlog is a program that lets you browse your web server's access log files.
It does not generate static HTML status reports but instead shows you all
accesses in a list that you can filter, sort and search easily. It's a
console application and supposed to run on the server via ssh.

Filters that accept regular expressions can be applied.
