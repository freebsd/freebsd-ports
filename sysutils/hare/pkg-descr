hare is a small utility which is installed in a PAM configuration
(e.g. for sshd) in order to log successful logins. This is often
useful to alert on machines which are seldom visited or otherwise monitored.

This client works in conjunction with the server sysutils/py-hared

This will form part of a centralized message distribution system.
