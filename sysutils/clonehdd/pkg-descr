Tool for copy partitions to another HDD. FreeBSD stores its data on
partitions, which are encapsulated in slices. Soft, such as Partition
Magic, Acronis, etc. detect only slice, not real partitions on that
slice. CloneHDD correctly understand size difference between two HDD
and change size of each partition proportionally for filling entire
HDD.
