Tool for copy partitions to another HDD. FreeBSD  stores  its  data  on
partitions,  which  encapsulated  in  slices.  Soft,  such as Partition
Magic, Acronis, etc. detect only slice, not  real  partitions  on  that
slice.   CloneHDD  correctly  understand size difference between two HDD
and change size of each partition  proportionally  for  filling  entire
HDD.
