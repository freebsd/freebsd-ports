Magic Rescue scans a block device for file types it knows how to recover and
calls an external program to extract them. It looks at "magic bytes" in file
contents, so it can be used both as an undelete utility and for recovering a
corrupted drive or partition. As long as the file data is there, it will
find it.

It works on any file system, but on very fragmented file systems it can only
recover the first chunk of each file. Practical experience shows, however, that
chunks of 30-50MB are not uncommon.
