DTrace suite for FreeBSD dwatch(1) to produce JSON stats.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is easily consumed by log aggregators such as
Kafka and Telegraf and visualizers like Grafana and Vizceral. It is also easily
parsed, filtered, and transformed with jq.

With this package you can get data out of the kernel for use in such tools,
aggregators, and visualizers.

Included in this package are service suites which help automate the collection
of statistics for time-series graphing (with Grafana for example). The suites
consist of general daemons, sample configs, statistics-gathering daemons
(utilizing telegraf), log-rotation tools, default cron.d entries for calling
said tools, and many convenience features including full service(8) integration
and rc.conf(5) support.
