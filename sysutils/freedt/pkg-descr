A reimplementation of Dan Bernstein's daemontools under the GNU GPL,
sharing no code with the original implementation.

It currently includes feature-equivalent replacements for argv0, envdir,
envuidgid, setlock, setuidgid, softlimit, supervise, svc, svok, svscan,
svstat and recordio.  It also includes dumblog (a simple multilog
replacement), mkservice (a script for automatically creating service
directories), anonidentd (an anonimising identd implementation) and
ratelimit (a bandwidth-limiting filter along the lines of recordio). All
the tools include usage messages; for instance, do "ratelimit -h" for a
brief rundown of the options.

Please note that this package is *not* a drop-in replacement for
daemontools; the internal state files in service directories are
different, and the error messages (and a few of the options) aren't
quite the same. It's also still somewhat experimental, so I'd recommend
sticking with daemontools on production systems until there's a stable
release of freedt.
