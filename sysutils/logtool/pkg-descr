Logtool is a command line program that will parse ASCII logfiles into a more
palatable format. It will take anything resembling a standard syslog file
(this includes syslog-ng, multilog, and probably most of the other variantse),
and crunch it into one of the following formats for your viewing pleasure:

  - ANSI (colorized for easy "at a glance" viewing)
  - ASCII (for e-mail'ed reports, and term's that don't support color)
  - CSV (for importing into your favorite spreadsheet/database)
  - HTML (for generating web pages)
  - RAW (for no good reason)

It can be configured to parse the data any one of several ways, including
suppressing duplicate messages, stripping the host, and/or program fields,
and modifying the time display format (supports TAI64 timestamps produced
by DJB's multilog) of the log entries.
