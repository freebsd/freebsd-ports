read-edid is a pair of tools (originally by John Fremlin) for reading the
EDID from a monitor.  It should work with most monitors made since 1996,
assuming the video card supports the standard read commands (most do).

Two tools are provided: get-edid, which gets the raw EDID information from
the monitor, and parse-edid, which turns the raw binary information into a
xorg.conf-compatible monitor section (or xrandr-compatible modelines).
