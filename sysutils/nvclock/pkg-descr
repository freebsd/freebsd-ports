NVClock is a small utility that allows users to 
overclock NVIDIA based video cards running on
*nix platforms. The original code used in building 
this application was borrowed from the nvcs 
application. That code has been extensively reworked 
in order to make the utility much more user friendly 
and to make it play nice with current distros and 
drivers.
