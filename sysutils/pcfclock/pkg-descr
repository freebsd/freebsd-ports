This port provides the pcfdate utility which reads the time of day from a
pcfclock device, writes it to stdout or, optionally, sets the system time.

You can benefit from pcfdate in case that

 - your geographic location is in Central Europe within a radius of roughly
   1500 km from the DCF77 transmitter near Frankfurt/Main, Germany,

 - you have the Conrad parallel port radio clock attached to your machine,

 - you have the pcfclock device driver enabled in your kernel configuration.

The primary use of pcfdate is to initialize the system time on boot. In its
normal operation the Conrad clock synchronizes with the transmitter once a
day, and the time of day displayed refers to its internal quartz clock which,
however, suffers from a considerable drift. The resulting accumulated error
can reach about 0.6 sec after 24 hours. Combined with the clockspeed port
this can still be considered a useful initialization: sntpclock can later be
used to gradually adjust the system time with the global network time very
effectively within a few minutes.
