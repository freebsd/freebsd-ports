This new design of syslog allows for an easy implementation of input and output
modules. The modules that mantain compatibility with its precursor (Secure
Syslog) are included in the standard distribution along with four modules:
om_peo (an implementation of PEO-1 and L-PEO, two algorithmic protocols for
integrity checking), om_mysql and om_pgsql (modules that sends output to a
MySQL and PostgreSQL database, respectively) and om_regex (a module that allows
output redirection using regular expressions).
