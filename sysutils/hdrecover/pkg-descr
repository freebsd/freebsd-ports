Attempts to recover a hard disk that has bad blocks on it.

WARNING: A hard disk with bad blocks on is likely to fail! If you value
your data you should get a new hard disk instead of using this program!

However, if you can't afford a new hard disk, or just like being reckless
with your data then this tool might just help you out!
