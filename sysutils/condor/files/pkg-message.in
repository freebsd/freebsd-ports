Sample condor_config and condor_config.local files are available in
%%ETCDIR%%.  Copy them to %%PREFIX%%/etc and edit condor_config.local to taste
to get started.

Settings in condor_config.local override the defaults in condor_config.
Use condor_config as a reference, and make all changes to condor_config.local.

Unless this is the central manager host, you will need to at least change
CONDOR_HOST.  Also ensure that DAEMON_LIST and ALLOW_* are appropriate for
this host.

To start the condor daemons, add 'condor_enable="YES"' to

	/etc/rc.conf

and run

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/condor start
