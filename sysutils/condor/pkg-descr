Condor is a open-source, specialized workload management system for
compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides
a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource
monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs
to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and where to run the
jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately
informs the user upon completion. Condor also contains mechanisms to submit
jobs to grid-sites and supports many different grid toolkits.

It is developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Department of Computer
Sciences.
