Jailrc is an improved startup/shutdown script for FreeBSD jails.

It contains the following changes to the original /etc/rc.d/jail script:

- parameters support: you can specify any parameters supported by jail(8)
- ZFS support: you can deletate ZFS datasets to jails
- jails are not identified by a file in /var/spool/jail anymore
- two new commands "create" and "remove" to manage persistent jails

Please refer to the README file for more information.
