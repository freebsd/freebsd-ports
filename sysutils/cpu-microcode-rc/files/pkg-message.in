This port includes an RC script, which is one of two methods to update
the CPU microcode on a FreeBSD system.

1. Early loading.
   This method does not use the RC script included here.
   This is the preferred method, because it ensures that any CPU features
   added or removed by a microcode update are visible to the kernel by
   applying the update before the kernel performs CPU feature detection.

   To enable updates using early loading, add the following lines to
   /boot/loader.conf:

   cpu_microcode_load="YES"

   and the appropriate one of these lines:

   cpu_microcode_name="/boot/firmware/intel-ucode.bin"
   cpu_microcode_name="/boot/firmware/amd-ucode.bin"

   The microcode update will be loaded when the system is rebooted.

   AMD systems running FreeBSD prior to 2024-02-22 snapshot
   34467bd76 only support late loading.


2. Late loading.
   This method, which does use the RC script included here, is enabled by
   adding the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

   microcode_update_enable="YES"

   The microcode update is then applied upon reboot or when the microcode
   update service is run via:

   # service microcode_update start

   If the CPU requires a microcode update, a console message such as the
   following will appear:

   Updating CPU Microcode...
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl0 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl2 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl4 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   %%DATADIR%%/m32306c3_00000022.fw: updating cpu /dev/cpuctl6 from rev 0x17 to rev 0x22... done.
   Done.

It is safe to enable both methods.
