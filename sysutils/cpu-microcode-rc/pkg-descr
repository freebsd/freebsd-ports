An RC script for one of two methods to update CPU microcode.

Early loading, which does not require this RC script, is usually the preferred
method because updates are applied before the kernel performs CPU feature
detection.  The other method, which requires this RC script, is late loading.
AMD systems running FreeBSD prior to 2024-02-22 snapshot 34467bd76 only support
late loading.

CPU microcode data can be installed from one of the sysutils/cpu-microcode-*
ports.
