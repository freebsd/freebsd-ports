minirsyslogd is a minimalistic, fast and secure (through lack of bloat)
remote-only syslog receiver suitable for hardened log receiver hosts 
and/or central log receivers that receive several gigabyte of logs each day.

It will not deal with local syslog data. It does not have a multitude
of configuration, alerting or scripting options. It will however
automatically split inbound syslog data according to IP address,
date and current hour, and do so as rapidly and (I hope) securely as
possible.
