This set of scripts allows you to imitate Windows feature to automount some
network shares at login time. It is relatively difficult in setup - you should
understand, what you do, know how to install SMB/CIFS support into a kernel,
how to setup /etc/nsmb.conf and .nsmbrc files, etc.

Script are written on Shell. Uses Samba utility findsmb to locate Windows boxes
when generated .nsmbrc file in semi-automated mode with smb2nsmbrc helper
script. Also uses their own file .mssmbrc to describe any share, mounted with
mountsmb2.
