HTTPDirFS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Directory Filesystem. It may
be used to to mount HTTP directory listings as if it was a partition.

HTTP connections are reused due to the use of cURL-multi interface. The FUSE
component runs in multithreaded mode.

There is a permanent cache system which can cache all the file segments that
have been downloaded.

The support for Airsonic / Subsonic server is also included. This allows the
user to mount a remote music collection locally.
