Shellany captures command output.

Features:
- Portability (should work on recent JRuby versions).
- Capturing stdout, stderr in a convenient way.
- Returning the result in a convenient way.
- Detecting if a shell is needed (though incomplete/primitive implementation).
- Prevents running the same command multiple times.
