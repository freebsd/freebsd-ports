Notes for FreeBSD 4.x users:
1. The FreeBSD k3b port supports SCSI drives only. If you have IDE CD or DVD
   drives, use them through the cam system. See Chapter 12.5.9 of the handbook
   (http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/creating-cds.html#ATAPICAM)
2. Your CD and DVD drives must have a mount point in /etc/fstab. They have
   to be accessed through their atapicam device if possible. I.e. the drives
   have to be adressed by e.g. /dev/cd0c instead of /dev/acd0c.
3. k3b has to be started from a root console, which is not recommended.
   Alternatively do ALL of the following:
3a. set the suid flag on cdrecord and cdrdao. The 'Notes' chapter of
    'man cdrecord' discusses this.
3b. - For every user who should be able to use k3b and for every CD or DVD
      device add a directory in the users home directory. These directories
      must be owned by the corresponding user. For each such directory add a
      line in /ect/fstab (see remark 2), like:
        /dev/cd0c  /usr/home/XXX/cdrom  cd9660  ro,noauto,nodev,nosuid  0  0
      Furthermore allow user mounts as described in topic 9.22 of the FAQ:
      http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/disks.html#USER-FLOPPYMOUNT
    - or just give mount and umount the suid flag, which is a security leak.
3c. Every user who should be able to use k3b must have read and write access
    to all pass through devices connected with CD and DVD drives and to the 
    /dev/xpt0 device. Run 'camcontrol devlist' to identify those devices (seek 
    string 'passX' at the end of each line and modify the rights of /dev/passX). 
    Note, that this is a security leak as well but that there is no alternative!
4. Check, that dma is activated for atapi devices: 'sysctl hw.ata.atapi_dma'
   If not, set it to 1 and put a 'hw.ata.atapi_dma=1' into /boot/loader.conf   
5. Create a directory on a partition, which has enough disk space to hold a CDs
   or DVDs content (usually below /usr). Enter this directory in Settings->
   Configure K3b...->Misc.
6. If you experience problems while burning CDs, try to set the cdrdao driver 
   manually. To do so choose Settings->Configure K3b...->Devices. Below the CD 
   recorder click on the string "auto" behind "Cdrdao driver:" For most of the 
   recent drives "generic-mmc" or "generic-mmc-raw" should work. 
   See http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/drives.html.
7. To burn video CDs install the port multimedia/vcdimager.
8. To rip DVDs additionally install the ports multimedia/transcode,
   multimedia/libdvdread and multimedia/xvid. Note that k3b does NOT work with
   transcode 0.6.12. 0.6.10 is the last known working version. The ripping 
   process itself is described in 
   http://k3b.plainblack.com/index.pl/videoencoding.
9. To burn bootable video CDs, install the port multimedia/emovix.
10. To burn DVDs, install the port sysutils/dvd+rw-tools.
11. To normalize the volumes of audio cds, install the port audio/normalize.
12. To rip into more audio formats, install the port audio/sox.

UPGRADERS FROM 0.11.6 OR BELOW SHOULD NOTE THE CHANGED TOPIC 3C!!!
