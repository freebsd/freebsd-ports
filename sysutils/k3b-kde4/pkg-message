Notes for FreeBSD 7.x and onwards users:
1. The FreeBSD k3b port supports SCSI drives only. If you have IDE CD or DVD
   drives, use them through the cam system. See Chapter 18.6.9 of the handbook
   (http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/creating-cds.html#ATAPICAM)
2. k3b has to be started from a root console, which is not recommended.
   Alternatively, do ALL of the following:
   a. Set the suid flag on cdrecord and cdrdao. The 'Notes' chapter of
      'man cdrecord' discusses this.
   b. Set the vfs.usermount sysctl variable to 1.
        # sysctl vfs.usermount=1
      Add the line vfs.usermount=1 to /etc/sysctl.conf
      Note that this has negative security implications
   c. Every user must have read and write access to /dev/cdX:
      - add to your /etc/devfs.rules under '[system=10]':
          add path 'cd*' mode 666
      - or if you prefer allow access for a group XXX only add instead:
          add path 'cd*' mode 660 group XXX
      - to enable it, add to your /etc/rc.conf a
          devfs_system_ruleset="system"
   d. Every user who should be able to use k3b must have read and write access
      to all pass through devices connected with CD and DVD drives and to the
      /dev/xpt0 device. Run 'camcontrol devlist' to identify those devices (seek
      string 'passX' at the end of each line). Note, that this is a security
      leak as well but that there is no alternative!
      - add to your /etc/devfs.rules under '[system=10]':
          add path 'pass*' mode 666
          add path 'xpt0' mode 666
      - or if you prefer allow access for a group XXX only add instead:
          add path 'pass*' mode 660 group XXX
          add path 'xpt0' mode 660 group XXX
      - to enable it, add to your /etc/rc.conf
          devfs_system_ruleset="system"
      - to apply these changes without reboot, run as root:
          /etc/rc.d/devfs restart
3. Check, that DMA is activated for atapi devices: 'sysctl hw.ata.atapi_dma'
   If not, set it to 1 and put 'hw.ata.atapi_dma=1' into /boot/loader.conf.
4. Create a directory on a partition, which has enough disk space to hold a CDs
   or DVDs content (usually below /usr). Enter this directory in Settings->
   Configure K3b...->Misc.
