Notes:
1. The FreeBSD k3b port supports SCSI drives only. If you have IDE CD or DVD
   drives, use them through the cam system. See Chapter 12.5.9 of the handbook
   (http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/creating-cds.html#ATAPICAM)
2. Your CD and DVD drives must have a mount point in /etc/fstab. They have
   to be accessed through their atapicam device. I.e. the drives
   have to be adressed by /dev/cd0c instead of /dev/acd0c.
3. k3b has to be started from a root console, which is not recommended.
   Alternatively do the following:
3a. set the suid flag on cdrecord and cdrdao. The 'Notes' the chapter of
    'man cdrecord' discusses this.
3b. - install sudo (security/sudo) and add the following line or similar to
      sudoers (usually in /usr/local/etc/sudoers):
      ALL             ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/camcontrol devlist
    - or execute 'camcontrol devlist' For every user who should be able to use 
      k3b. Resolve all errors e.g by giving him/her access rights to /dev/xpt0.
      'camcontrol devlist' must run without error for all these users!
      Note that giving access rights to /dev/xpt* might be a security leak!
    - or give camcontrol the suid flag, which is a security leak as well.
3c. - For every user who should be able to use k3b and for every CD or DVD
      device add a directory in the users home directory. These directories
      must be owned by the corresponding user. For each such directory add a
      line in /ect/fstab (see remark 2), like:
        /dev/cd0c  /usr/home/XXX/cdrom  cd9660  ro,noauto,nodev,nosuid  0  0
      Furthermore allow user mounts as described in topic 9.22 of the FAQ:
      http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/disks.html#USER-FLOPPYMOUNT
    - or just give mount and umount the sudo flag, which is a security leak.
3d. - Every user who should be able to use k3b must have read and write access
      to all pass through devices connected with CD and DVD drives. Run
      'camcontrol devlist' to identify those devices (seek string 'passX' at
      the end of each line and modify the rights of /dev/passX). Note, that
      this is a security leak as well but that there is no alternative!
4. Create a directory on a partition, which has enough disk space to hold a CDs
   or DVDs content (usually below /usr). Enter this directory in Settings->
   Configure K3b...->Misc.
5. You should set the cdrdao driver manually. Otherwise the disk info might
   fail or lock a while. To do so choose Settings->Configure K3b...->Devices. 
   Below the CD recorder click on the string "auto" behind "Cdrdao driver:" 
   For most of the recent drives "generic-mmc" or "generic-mmc-raw" should 
   work. See http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/drives.html.
6. To burn video CDs install the port multimedia/vcdimager.
7. To rip DVDs additionally install the ports multimedia/transcode,
   multimedia/libdvdread and multimedia/xvid. Note that multimedia/transcode 
   requires some variables to be set. Type "make fetch" in the 
   multimedia/transcode ports directory for details. The ripping process
   itself is described in 
   http://k3b.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.pl/videoencoding.
8. To burn bootable video CDs, install the port multimedia/emovix.
9. To burn DVDs, install the port sysutils/dvd+rw-tools.
10. To normalize the volumes of audio cds, install the port audio/normalize.
11. To rip into more audio formats, install the port audio/sox.

To read these instructions again, type 'make showinfo' in the k3b port
directory.
