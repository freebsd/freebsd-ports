The primary goal of scriptine is to make it easy to write shell scripts with
python.

Features:

 * Easy command creation. Each command is just a function.
 * Automatic option parsing
 * Automatic help text (--help)
 * Log handling (with -v, --verbose and -q, --quiet handling)
 * Testing scripts in dry-mode.
 * Easy execution of other shell scripts.
 * Convenient working with files and directories.
