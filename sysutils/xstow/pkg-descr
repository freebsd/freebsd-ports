 XStow is a replacement of GNU Stow written in C++. It supports all features
of Stow with some extensions.

XStow as GNU Stow, are programs for managing the installation of software
packages, keeping them separate (/usr/local/stow/emacs
vs. /usr/local/stow/perl, for example) while making them appear to be
installed in the same place (/usr/local).
