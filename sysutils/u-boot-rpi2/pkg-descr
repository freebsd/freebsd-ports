U-Boot loader for Raspberry Pi 2

To install this bootloader, copy u-boot.bin in the share/u-boot/u-boot-rpi
directory to the first partition, formatted as FAT16 or FAT32, on an SD card.
You will also need the firmware files from the rpi-firmware package.

This version is patched so that:
 * ELF and API features are enabled.
 * The distroboot command knows how to load FreeBSD loader(8)
 * By default, it loads ubldr.bin (PIE) from file ubldr.bin on the FAT
   partition to address ${kernel_addr_r}, and launches it. If ubldr.bin is
   not found, it falls back on ubldr
