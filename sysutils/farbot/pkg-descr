Farbot automates building of netinstall/PXE boot FreeBSD releases. It features a
simple configuration file based on the concept of "Installations",
"PackageSets", and "PartitionMaps."

Farbot currently handles the following:

* Building FreeBSD releases, including grabbing any source needed.
* Building packages for each release, derived from per installation package
  sets.
* Laying out an NFS/TFTP exportable file system structure for all built
  releases, customized for each installation type.
* Generation of a customized bootloader with options to install each
  installation type
