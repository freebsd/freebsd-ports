CDargs heavily enhances the navigation of the common unix file-system
inside the shell. It plugs into the shell built-in cd-command (via a shell
function or an alias) and thus adds bookmarks and a browser to it. It
enables you to move to a very distant place in the file-system with just
a few keystrokes.
