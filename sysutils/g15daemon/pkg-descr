G15daemon takes control of the G15 keyboard, allowing the use of all keys 
through the uinput device driver. It also controls the use of the 
keyboard's LCD display, allows multiple, simultaneous client applications
to connect, and gives the user the ability to switch between client apps 
at the press of a button.
