mksunbootcd combines filesystem partitions for Sun Microsystems,
Inc. computers into an image suitable for writing to a compact
disc, that will allow the disc to be booted on the sun3, sun3x, sun4,
sun4c, sun4m and sun4u platforms.  This hardware is supported by the
NetBSD sparc, sparc64 and sun3 ports.
