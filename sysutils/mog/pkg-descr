The man page for cat says that it can: concatenate files and print on the
standard output. Often its main use is for the latter. mog tries to help you
"print on the standard output" in a more intelligent way. For example, it can
be configured to:

   * Syntax highlight scripts
   * Print a hex dump of binary files
   * Show details of image files
   * Perform objdump on executables
   * List a directory
