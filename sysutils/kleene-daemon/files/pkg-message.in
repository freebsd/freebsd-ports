Kleene is a new tool and should be used for
testing and experimentation purposes only.

To use Kleened, enable it in rc.conf using

  sysrc kleened_enable=YES

Kleened requires certain services and kernel modules to be configured in order
to work properly. Run

  service kleened init

to make Kleened automatically try and configure the host for you.
Alternatively, run

  service kleened dryinit

to get an overview of what needs to be configured, without actually changing
the host.

NB. The %%ETCDIR%%/config.yaml file should be edited before running
    'service kleened init' since some of the parameters are used during host
    initialization.

You can then start Kleened by running:

  service kleened start
EOM
}
