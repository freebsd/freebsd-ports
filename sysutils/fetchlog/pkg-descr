The fetchlog utility displays the last new messages of a logfile.
It is similar like tail (1) but offers some extra functionality like
pattern matching with regular expressions or output formatting. To show
only the new messages appeared since the last call fetchlog uses a
bookmark to remember which messages have been fetched.

fetchlog works on syslog generated logfiles as well as other logfiles.

fetchlog can be used standalone or as a Nagios (TM) plugin.  Together
with Net-SNMP one can look at/monitor new messages in remote logfiles.
