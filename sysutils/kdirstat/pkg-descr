KDirStat (for KDE Directory Statistics) is a
small utility program that sums up disk usage
for direcory trees. Its functionality is similar
to the Unix du command, but it provides more
helpful diagnostic information. KDirStat also
features some built-in cleanup facilities and
the ability to include your own cleanup commands
or scripts.
