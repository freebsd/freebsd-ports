kapp CLI encourages Kubernetes users to manage resources in bulk by working with
"Kubernetes applications" (sets of resources with the same label).
It focuses on resource diffing, labeling, deployment and deletion.
Unlike tools like Helm, kapp considers YAML templating and management of
packages outside of its scope,
though it works great with tools that generate Kubernetes configuration.
