A set of commands to work with XFS filesystems, including mkfs.xfs(8).

XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated on the
SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can support large
files and large filesystems, extended attributes, variable block sizes,
is extent based, and makes extensive use of B-trees (for directories,
extents, free space) to aid both performance and scalability.
