usermatic

is a collection of Perl scripts to automate maintenance of the
user database on Linux and FreeBSD. Originally it was developed for
FreeBSD, but it should work on Linux as well. These scripts compare the
passwd database to the current list of employees/students/etc. which has
to be supplied in a suitable format. This package was designed to work
together with userneu.pl (sysutils/userneu/) and contains no facilities 
to do the actual account creation work, instead it outputs a list suitable 
for processing with userneu. Stale accounts can be deleted using the reaper.pl
script.

These scripts are experimental but they should work ok. 
Please report bugs to me if you find them.
