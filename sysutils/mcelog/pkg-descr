mcelog processes machine checks (in particular memory and CPU
hardware errors) on modern x86-based unix systems and
produces human-readable output.

This software is heavily patched to work on FreeBSD systems,
and thus provides an extremely limited subset of features as
of this writing.  The primary purpose is to provide a way to
decode MCE output from the FreeBSD kernel into something more
human-readable using the command 'mcelog --no-dmi --ascii'

FreeBSD conversion patches were originally written by John
Baldwin <jhb@freebsd.org> and later incorporated into this
port.
