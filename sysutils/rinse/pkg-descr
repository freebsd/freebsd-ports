Rinse is a simple tool which is designed to carry out the installation
of a new RPM-based distribution.

Using rinse you can easily setup simple chroot() systems running
different RPM-based distributions, such as CentOS, Scientific Linux or
openSUSE.

The purpose and usage are analogous to the 'debootstrap' utility
familiar to users of Debian GNU/Linux. It was primarily designed to
work with the xen-tools software, which creates new guest images for
running under the Xen hypervisor.
