To enable sending of panic reports, add
	dumpdev="AUTO"
	panicmail_enable="YES"
to your /etc/rc.conf.

By default panic reports will be sent to root with instructions to forward
them if they do not contain any sensitive information.  To automatically
submit panic reports directly, add
	panicmail_autosubmit="YES"
to your /etc/rc.conf in addition.
