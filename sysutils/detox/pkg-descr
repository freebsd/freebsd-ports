This is a port of detox, which is a program that renames files to make them
easier to work with under Unix and related operating systems.  Spaces and
various other unsafe characters (such as "$") get replaced with "_".  ISO
8859-1 (Latin-1) characters can be replaced as well, as can UTF-8 characters.
