Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd supporting, among others,
MySQL, syslog/tcp, RFC 3195, permitted sender lists, filtering on any
message part, and fine grain output format control. It is quite
compatible to stock sysklogd and can be used as a drop-in replacement.
Its advanced features make it suitable for enterprise-class, encryption
protected syslog relay chains while at the same time being very easy to
setup for the novice user.

Rsyslog v2 is deprecated and is no longer supported. It operates with some
limitations under FreeBSD. Consider using Rsyslog v3 or v4.
