abduco provides session management i.e., it allows programs to be run
independently from their controlling terminal. That is programs can be
detached - run in the background - and then later reattached. Together
with dvtm it provides a simpler and cleaner alternative to tmux or
screen.

abduco is in many ways very similar to dtach but is a completely
independent implementation which is actively maintained, contains no
legacy code, provides a few additional features, has a cleaner, more
robust implementation and is distributed under the ISC license.
