cpdup-FreeBSD is a FreeBSD fork of cpdup, a powerful filesystem mirroring
and backup utility which also has file integrity testing features, supports
incremental backups, and remote mirroring via ssh.

This fork supports copy_file_range(2) and allows choosing checksum
algorithm.

Note: This port does not copy (or mirror) any FreeBSD supported ACL
types and Extended Attributes nor MAC labels.
