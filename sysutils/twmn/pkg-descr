twmn is a notification system for tiling window managers. It consists of the
two programs:

twmnc: command line tool to send notifications to twmnd. You can also use
notify-send for a similar purpose, but twmnc is more powerful. See
twmnc --help for more information.

twmnd: daemon listening to notification requests and showing them one after
another. Configure it at ~/.config/twmn/twmn.conf. The file is generated the
first time twmnd is launched.

Notifications are shown in a one-line bar called the notification slide.
They can be navigated through and activated with shortcuts.
