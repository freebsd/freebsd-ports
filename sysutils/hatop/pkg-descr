HATop is an interactive ncurses client and real-time monitoring
statistics displaying tool for the HAProxy Unix socket.

HATop's appearance is similar to top. It supports various modes for
detailed statistics of all configured proxies and services in near
realtime. In addition, it features an interactive CLI for the haproxy
Unix socket. This allows administrators to control the given haproxy
instance (change server weight, put servers into maintenance mode,
etc.) directly out of hatop (using keybinds or the CLI) and monitor the
results immediately.
