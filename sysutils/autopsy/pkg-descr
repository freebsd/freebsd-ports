The Autopsy Forensic Browser is a graphical interface to the command line 
digital forensic analysis tools in The Sleuth Kit. Together, The Sleuth Kit 
and Autopsy provide many of the same features as commercial digital 
forensics tools for the analysis of Windows and UNIX file systems 
(NTFS, FAT, FFS, EXT2FS, and EXT3FS).

The Sleuth Kit and Autopsy are both Open Source and run on UNIX platforms. 
As Autopsy is HTML-based, the investigator can connect to the Autopsy 
server from any platform using an HTML browser. Autopsy provides 
a "File Manager"-like interface and shows details about deleted data 
and file system structures.
