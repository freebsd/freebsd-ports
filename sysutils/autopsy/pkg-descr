The Autopsy Forensic Browser is a graphical interface to the command line
digital investigation analysis tools in The Sleuth Kit.  Together, they can
analyze Windows and UNIX disks and file systems (NTFS, FAT, UFS1/2, Ext2/3).

As Autopsy is HTML-based, you can connect to the Autopsy server from any
platform using an HTML browser.  Autopsy provides a "File Manager"-like
interface and shows details about deleted data and file system structures.

WARNING: The cross-platform version of Autopsy is no longer actively
         developed. This port is retained mainly to allow users with
         saved data to migrate to another forensic tool.
