Quoting IPMItool homepage:

"IPMItool is a utility for managing and configuring devices that
support the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) version
1.5 and version 2.0 specifications. IPMI is an open standard for
monitoring, logging, recovery, inventory, and control of hardware that
is implemented independent of the main CPU, BIOS, and OS."

FreeBSD has OpenIPMI-compatible ipmi(4) driver for in-band IPMI
operations in the base system starting from 6.2 release. On older
systems sysutils/ipmi-kmod port is available.
