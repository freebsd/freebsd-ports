After installing Usermin for the first time you should perform the following
steps as root:

* Configure Usermin by running ${LOCALBASE}/lib/usermin/setup.sh

* Add usermin_enable="YES" to your /etc/rc.conf

* Start Usermin for the first time by running ${LOCALBASE}/etc/rc.d/usermin

The parameters requested by setup.sh may then be changed from within Usermin
itself.
