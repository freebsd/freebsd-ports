U-Boot loader for Utilite and Utilite Pro

Install the cm-fx6-firmware file onto the boot disk using:

  dd if=cm-fx6-firmware of=/dev/whatever bs=1k skip=1 seek=1 oflag=dsync

The U-Boot built by this port expects the first 1MB of the boot media to
be reserved for the U-Boot executable and saved environment. The firmware
file begins at an offset of 1K from the start of the boot disk. The U-Boot
environment area begins at an offset of 512K.

This version is patched so that:
 * ELF and API features are enabled to support ubldr.
 * A single U-Boot image supports Utilite and Utilite Pro.
 * When the selected board has multiple SD or MMC devices available, the
   mmc0 device in U-Boot (and thus the disk0 device in loader(8)) will be
   whichever device U-Boot was loaded from by the ROM bootloader routines.

The sources for this port are based on stock U-Boot 2015.07 with patches
