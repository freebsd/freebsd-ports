================================================================
This port installed %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/env4801.sh to initialize
the hardware at boot time. The env4801 utility will only run on
a Soekris Engineering Net4801 device. See pkg-descr for more
information as currently there is no manpage.

Make sure you have /dev/io enabled by putting io_load="YES" in
/boot/loader.conf or device io in your kernel config file.
