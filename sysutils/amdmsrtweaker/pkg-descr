FreeBSD port of the AmdMsrTweaker program to adjust P-states for AMD 10h,
12h, and 15h family processors, originally written by Martin Kinkelin and
extended by Marcus Pollice.

It has been tested with a 14h (AMD E-350) and a 15h (AMD A10-5700) CPUs,
but should work with all processors supported by AmdMsrTweaker.
