Treemd is a modern markdown viewer that combines the structural clarity of the
tree command with powerful interactive navigation. Whether you're exploring
large documentation files, analyzing markdown structure, or reading comfortably
in your terminal, treemd provides both CLI tools for scripting and a beautiful
TUI for interactive exploration.

Use it to:

  - Navigate large documents by collapsing/expanding heading sections
  - Search headings or full document content with highlighted matches
  - Edit tables, toggle checkboxes, and follow links-all without leaving the
    terminal
  - Extract specific sections or query markdown elements with a jq-like syntax
  - Pipe markdown from stdin for shell-scripted workflows
