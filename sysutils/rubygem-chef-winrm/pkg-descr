Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for Ruby

This is a SOAP library that uses the functionality in Windows Remote
Management(WinRM) to call native object in Windows. This includes, but is not
limited to, running batch scripts, powershell scripts and fetching WMI
variables.

As of version 2.0, this gem retains the WinRM name but all powershell calls use
the more modern Powershell Remoting Protocol (PSRP) for initializing runspace
pools as well as creating and processing powershell pipelines.
