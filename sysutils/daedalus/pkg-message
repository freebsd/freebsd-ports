IMPORTANT NOTE:
===============

If you are upgrading from a version previous to 2.0, the
location and layout of the configuration files has changed.
They are now in XML and a templates.xml file can be referenced
that allows updating of templates from machine to
machine without disrupting the actual checks being performed.

To use daedalus, be sure to include

daedalus_enable="YES"

in rc.conf
