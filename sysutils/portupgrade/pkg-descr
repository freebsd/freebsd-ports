Portupgrade is a tool to upgrade installed packages via ports or
packages.  You can upgrade installed packages without having to
reinstall depending or dependent packages.  It can automatically trace
dependency chains up and down upgrading packages recursively.

This package also includes the following utilities:
portinstall:	Helps you install new ports in a handy way.
portcvsweb:	Instantly lets you browse change history via CVSweb.
portversion:	Replaces pkg_version(1) and helps you upgrade packages
		with portupgrade(1). (runs much faster)
portsclean:	Cleans ports workdir's, unreferenced distfiles,
		old and orphan shared libraries, and stale packages.
portsdb:	Creates binary database from the ports INDEX.
ports_glob:	Expands ports globs.
pkg_deinstall:	Wraps pkg_delete(1) and provides additional features.
pkg_fetch:	Fetches packages from a remote site.
pkg_glob:	Expands package globs.
pkg_which:	Checks which package a file came from quickly.
pkgdb:		Manages and searches the package database.
