Portupgrade is a tool to upgrade installed packages via ports or
packages.  It upgrades installed packages without reinstalling
depending or dependent packages by directly updating the package
registry database located under /var/db/pkg, while it can also trace
dependency chains up and down to upgrade packages recursively.

This package also includes the following utilities:
portinstall:	Helps you install new ports in a handy way.
		Equivalent to `portupgrade -N'.
portcvsweb:	Instantly browses a history via CVSweb.
portversion:	Replaces pkg_version(1).  This runs much faster and is
		cooperative with portupgrade(1).
portsclean:	Cleans ports workdir's and unreferenced distfiles.
portsdb:	Creates binary database from the ports INDEX.
pkg_deinstall:	Wraps pkg_delete(1) and provides wildcards and
		dependency recursion support, plus some more.
pkg_glob:	Expands package globs.
pkgdepfix:	Fixes the /var/db/pkg registry interactively.
