Description
===========
With a single process, GKrellM manages multiple stacked monitors and supports
applying themes to match the monitors appearance to your window manager,
Gtk, or any other theme.


GKrellM Features
================
	* SMP CPU, Disk, Proc, and active net interface monitors with LEDs.
