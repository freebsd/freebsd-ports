KDiskFree displays the available file devices (hard drive partitions,
floppy and CD/DVD drives, etc.) along with information on their
capacity, free space, type and mount point. It also allows you to
mount and unmount drives and view them in a file manager.

KDiskFree is similar to the Systemsettings Partitions module, but
takes up less screen space. It is useful if you want to keep a
KDiskFree window available at all times.
