Nuxi CloudABI is an application binary interface for UNIX-like operating
systems built around the concept of capability-based security. In a
nutshell, it means that you can run processes directly on top of a UNIX
kernel while keeping complete control over the actions the process is
allowed to perform.

This package installs utilities that are useful when running CloudABI
processes. The cloudabi-run utility can run CloudABI processes,
providing it the resources (sockets and files) that it requires.
