Use the qjail utility to deploy small or large numbers of jails quickly.

First issue "rehash" command to enable the qjail command (if using csh).
Then issue "man qjail-intro" to read the qjail introduction.
After reading that do "man qjail" for the usage details.
For the BIG PICTURE issue "man qjail-howto".

For users who have existing qjail environments. Please take note.
There are changes to the internals of the jail(8) command and changes to 
parameter names in the periodic files that have occured in FreeBSD 
Release 10.2 that effects jail behavior in a very minor way. 
IF your running qjail on an 10.2 or newer version of FreeBSD you should 
consider doing the following.

This version of qjail has an built in auto convert function that you may select
to choose that fixes those minor behavior problems with your existing jails.
This auto convert function is not documented in the qjail manual. Its only 
shown here. So write it down. 

       Issue [ qjail update -u ] from the host console. 

This will cause the existing "flavors" default & ssh-default directories to be 
renamed and new ones populated. Then in each existing jail the periodic.conf
and newsyslog.conf files will be renamed with .saved suffix and new ones added. 
The rc.conf file will be updated in place changing the 
syslogd_enable= parameter value from "NO" to "YES".

The new periodic.conf file has many sendmail reporting options disabled because
sendmail is disabled in the jails rc.conf file by default. This drastically
reduces the daily. weekly, monthly system and security status reports elapse
run times. This has a major effect on operating system performance where there 
are a large number of jails.

The [ qjail install ] command will install all the correct files depending on
what version of FreeBSD your host is running.
