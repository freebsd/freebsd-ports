If you have never used tarsnap before, you will need to create an account
with the tarsnap service and deposit money into the account before you
can start using tarsnap; see
  https://beta.tarsnap.com/gettingstarted.html
for details.

Once you have a tarsnap account you will need to create a key file using
the tarsnap-keygen utility before you start storing archives; this key
file MUST BE KEPT IN A SAFE LOCATION since you will not be able to read
your backups without it.
