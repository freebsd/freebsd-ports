bsdconfig is a robust utility for configuring/managing various aspects of the
FreeBSD Operating System. Feature-highlights include (but are not limited to):
  - Modular, stable, efficient and i18n-compatible.
  - Easily maintained/extendable sh(1) source/syntax.
  - Works with both dialog(1) in base and Xdialog(1) from ports (x11/xdialog).
  - Package management module loosely based on sysinstall but much improved.
  - rc.conf(5) configuration/management based on sysutils/sysrc.
  - Timezone configuration based on sysutils/tzdialog.
  - Networking management based on sysutils/host-setup.
