This port provides a program that loads the microcode firmware onto Sun
Microsystems AFB Graphics Accelerators aka Sun Microsystems Elite 3D
found in many UltraSPARC systems. The microcode is necessary if you want
to run XFree86 with acceleration on these cards.
The microcode in itself has to be obtained from an existing SunOS/Solaris
installation.
