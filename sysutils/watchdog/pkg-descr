Watchdog daemon for the AMD Elan sc520 system-on-chip.

The watchdogd deamon runs in the background and will reset the hardware
watchdog timer of the elan-mmcr/soekris every 16 seconds. If this timer
is not reset within 32 seconds thereafter the hardware will reboot.

This software was specifically developed for http://www.soekris.com/ boards
and for use within the http://www.wirelessleiden.nl/ project.
