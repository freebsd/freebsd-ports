socklog in cooperation with the runit package is a small and secure replacement
for syslogd. There are three main features, syslogd provides:

- receiving syslog messages from an Unix domain socket (/dev/log) or UDP socket
  (0.0.0.0:514) and writing them to various files on disk depending on facility
  and priority.
- writing received syslog messages to an UDP socket (a.b.c.d:514)

socklog provides these features with the help of runit's runsvdir,
runsv, and svlogd, provides a different network logging concept, and
additionally does log event notification.

svlogd has a built in log file rotation based on file size, so there is no
need for any cron jobs or similar to rotate the logs. Log partitions can be
calculated properly.
