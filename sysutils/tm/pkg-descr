Terminal mixer can start processes inside a pseudo-terminal, which can
be accessed through a Unix socket, TCP or even raw ethernet (not yet
ported to FreeBSD). The programs can be linked to the current
terminal, or they can be unlinked like in nohup. But even in this
latter case you can connect to them using the mentioned protocols.

tm can also start programs as if they communicate through pipes
instead of terminals, and this can be quite useful for
remote-controlling applications.

More than one client can connect to the served pseudo-terminal, either
using tm as a client or telnet for TCP. You can choose if they are
only allowed to read, or they can also contribute on input.
