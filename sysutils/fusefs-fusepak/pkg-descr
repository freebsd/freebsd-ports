Fusepak is a small program that makes it possible to mount PACK or WAD files
(used in many games, most notably by id Software) under a directory.  This
is achieved by using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace).  The following formats
are supported:

  - WAD, can be found in Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny games
  - PACK, can be found in Quake, Quake2, and other games based on
    id Software's Quake engine
  - WAD2, can be found inside of PACK files
  - LGP, can be found in PC version of Final Fantasy VII
  - PAK, can be found in Dune 2
  - KSGRP, can be found in Duke Nukem 3D

Secondary goal of fusepak is to provide simple framework which allows one to
quickly add support for another file format.
