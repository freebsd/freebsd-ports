BLAKE3 is a cryptographic hash function that is:
- Much faster than MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, and BLAKE2.
- Secure, unlike MD5 and SHA-1. And secure against length extension, unlike
  SHA-2.
- Highly parallelizable across any number of threads and SIMD lanes, because
  it's a Merkle tree on the inside.
- Capable of verified streaming and incremental updates, again because it's a
  Merkle tree.
- A PRF, MAC, KDF, and XOF, as well as a regular hash.
- One algorithm with no variants, which is fast on x86-64 and also on smaller
  architectures.
