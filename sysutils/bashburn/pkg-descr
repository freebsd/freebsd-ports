Sick of all those fancy CD-burning apps not working for you? You need
something that just gets the work done? Welcome to BashBurn - It just
works! 

BashBurn is the new name for the cd burning shell script Magma. It's
not the best looking CD-burning application out there, but it does
what you want it to do. (And if not then probably didn't want to do it
anyway)
