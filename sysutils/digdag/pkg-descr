Digdag is a simple tool that helps you to build, run, schedule, and monitor
complex pipelines of tasks. It handles dependency resolution so that tasks run
in series or in parallel.

Digdag replaces cron, facilitates IT operations automation, orchestrates data
engineering tasks, coordinates machine learning pipelines, and more.
