This is a collection of the Unix tools that nobody thought to write long ago,
when Unix was young.

Currently it consists of these tools:
- chronic: runs a command quietly unless it fails
- combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
- errno: look up errno names and descriptions
- ifdata: get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
- ifne: run a command if the standard input is not empty
- isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
- lckdo: execute a program with a lock held (deprecated)
- mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
- parallel: run multiple jobs at once
- pee: tee standard input to pipes
- sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
- ts: timestamp standard input
- vidir: edit a directory in your text editor
- vipe: insert a text editor into a pipe
- zrun: automatically uncompress arguments to command

Note that parallel and ts utilities are installed with "moreutils-" prefix.
