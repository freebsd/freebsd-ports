moreutils is a growing collection of the unix tools that nobody thought to
write thirty years ago.

So far, it includes the following utilities:

 - sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
 - ifne: run a program if the standard input is not empty
 - vidir: edit a directory in your text editor
 - vipe: insert a text editor into a pipe
 - ts: timestamp standard input
 - combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
 - pee: tee standard input to pipes
 - zrun: automatically uncompress arguments to command
 - mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
 - isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
 - lckdo: execute a program with a lock held

The 'ifdata' and 'parallel' utilities are not included in this FreeBSD port.
