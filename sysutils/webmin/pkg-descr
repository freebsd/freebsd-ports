Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration for Unix.
Using any browser that supports tables and forms, you can setup
user accounts, Apache, DNS, file sharing and so on.

Webmin consists of a simple web server, and a number of CGI programs
which directly update system files like /etc/inetd.conf and
/etc/passwd. The web server and all CGI programs are written in
Perl version 5, and use no external modules. This means that you
only need a Perl binary to run Webmin.
