Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration for Unix.
Using any browser that supports tables and forms, you can setup
user accounts, Apache, DNS, file sharing and so on.

Webmin consists of a simple web server, and a number of CGI programs
which directly update system files like /etc/inetd.conf and
/etc/master.passwd.
