After installing Webmin for the first time you should perform the following
steps as root:

* Configure Webmin by running %%LOCALBASE%%/lib/webmin/setup.sh

* Add webmin_enable="YES" to your /etc/rc.conf

* Start Webmin for the first time by running %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/rc.d/webmin start

The parameters requested by setup.sh may then be changed from within Webmin
itself.
