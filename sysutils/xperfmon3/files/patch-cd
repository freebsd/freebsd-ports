+ Further NFS server/client cache hits and misses. Rewriting of freebsd_system.c
+ and migration to the devstat library (Many thanks to Kenneth D. Merry
+ <ken@plutotech.com>). Scaling of the graphs changed from integer to floating
+ point values (-> system load is now displayed as is, and not mutliplied with
