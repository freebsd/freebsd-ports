GNU GRUB is a multiboot boot loader.  It was derived from GRUB, the GRand
Unified Bootloader, which was originally designed and implemented by Erich 
Stefan Boleyn.

This port does not install GRUB on the master boot record of your hard drive.
To do this, or to use it with a floppy disk, you will need to read the info 
page that is installed by the port.
