Tools for generating IP based Geo-block-ing and Geo-routing tables in
order to configure the system's firewall and/or routing facilities

In general, routing is determined by destination IP addresses, and access
control by the firewall is established by selectors that can be attrib-
uted to incoming and outgoing IP packets, like physical interfaces on
which the packets are going, source and target IP addresses, protocol
types, port numbers, content types and content, etc. The Geo-location
would be just another selector, but this information is not carried
explicitly with IP packets, however, it can be obtained using an IP
address as a key for looking-up the location in an IP database.

Online databases do exist, but these are usually limited to single queries
and in addition the look-up in an online database is by far too slow for
even thinking about being utilized at the firewall level, where IP packets
need to be processed in a microsecond time scale. Therefore, a locally
maintained Geo-location database is indispensable in the given respect.
The System's own routing and filtering tables can be configured to do
these tasks if there is a source of the appropriate data. The ipdbtools(1)
are designed to provide this data and to assist managing and using it.
