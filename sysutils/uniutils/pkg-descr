Uniutils consists of five programs for finding out what is in a Unicode file.
They are useful when working with Unicode files when one doesn't know the
writing system, doesn't have the necessary font, needs to inspect invisible
characters, needs to find out whether characters have been combined or in what
order they occur, or needs statistics on which characters occur.

uniname defaults to printing the character offset of each character, its byte
offset, its hex code value, its encoding, the glyph itself, and its name.

unidesc reports the character ranges to which different portions of the text
belong. It can also be used to identify Unicode encodings (e.g. UTF-16be)
flagged by magic numbers.

unihist generates a histogram of the characters in its input, which must be
encoded in UTF-8 Unicode.

ExplicateUTF8 is intended for debugging or for learning about Unicode. It
determines and explains the validity of a sequence of bytes as a UTF8 encoding.

Unirev is a filter that reverses UTF-8 strings character-by-character (as
opposed to byte-by-byte).
