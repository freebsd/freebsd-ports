This is a daemon the uses the LM78/79, WINBond 83781/83782/83783/83626
or the ASUS 99127 hardware monitor chips to warn the operator when
something is out of range.  The software is capable of monitoring up
to 3 temperatures, 3 fan speeds and 7 voltages. The configuration file
specifies which functions are active and their acceptable ranges.

With the healthdc companion program the status can be read from any
networked computer.  The healthd daemon's network connection is protected
by libwrap and /etc/hosts.allow.
