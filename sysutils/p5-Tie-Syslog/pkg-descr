This module allows you to tie a filehandle (output only) to
syslog. This becomes useful in general when you want to
capture any activity that happens on STDERR and see that it
is syslogged for later perusal. You can also create an arbitrary
filehandle, say LOG, and send stuff to syslog by printing to
this filehandle.
