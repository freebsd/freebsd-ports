dvdisaster has been installed.

Note that dvdisaster tries to read /dev/pass* to list available CD/DVD drives,
so the program will not detect any available drives if the user running
dvdisaster does not have permissions to read /dev/pass*

FreeBSD 9.x does not pre-install an uniform CD-ROM driver for SCSI and ATAPI
drives. Therefore dvdisaster can not use any ATAPI drives in an out-of-the-box
FreeBSD 9.x installation.

* Loading the atapicam kernel module by hand

To manually load the required kernel module, do:

root@freebsd# kldload atapicam

Use the follwing command to see if any CD/DVD/BD drives became available:

root@freebsd# camcontrol devlist
<NAME OF YOUR DRIVE>                at scbus1 target 0 lun 0 (pass0,cd0)

* (Optionally) loading the atapicam kernel module permanently

If the above step works you can load the kernel module at boot time by adding

atapicam_load="YES"

at the end of /boot/loader.conf

* (Optionally) recompiling the kernel

If the atapicam kernel module is not available (check the contents
of /boot/kernel) you will need to recompile the kernel with the following
additional device line in the kernel configuration:

device atapicam

The devices ata, scbus, cd, and pass are also required, but are included by
default in FreeBSD 6.0 and later.
