DSBMD is a media/filesystem type detecting daemon that allows clients to mount
storage devices.

DSBMD watches the mount table for changes, monitors devd events for new storage
devices, polls CD/DVD drives and card readers for media change events, deter-
mines media types, volume names, and filesystem types. Mountable devices,
changes in the mount table as well as device add/remove events and altered
states of mountable devices are presented to clients. Clients can request DSBMD
to mount, unmount, and eject media, or set the CD/DVD reading speed.
