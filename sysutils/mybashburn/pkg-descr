What's MyBashBurn?
Basically, it is no more than a Terminal User Interface (TUI) frontend based of
the CD burning shell script called BashBurn for GNU/Linux; this originally does
not have the best eye-candy CD-burning UI, nevertheless, MyBashBurn uses dialog
boxes/functions which draws (using ncurses) windows onto the screen. MyBashBurn
dialog boxes offer good functionality, and has very good capabilities of
automatically finding dependencies and auto detecting devices CD/DVD RW. In
short, do not reinvent the wheel - just let MyBashBurn do what you want it to
do.
