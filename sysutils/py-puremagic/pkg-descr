Puremagic is a python module that will identify a file from magic numbers.

It is designed to be minimalistic and inherently cross platform compatible.
It is also designed to be a stand in for python-magic, it incorporates the
functions from_file(filename[, mime]) and from_string(string[, mime])
however the magic_file() and magic_string() are more powerful and will also
display confidence and duplicate matches.

It does NOT try to match files off non-magic string. In other words it will
not search for a string within a certain window of bytes like others might.
