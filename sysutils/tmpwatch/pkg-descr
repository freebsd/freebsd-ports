The tmpwatch utility recursively searches through specified
directories and removes files which have not been accessed in a
specified period of time.  Tmpwatch is normally used to clean up
directories which are used for temporarily holding files (for example,
/tmp).  Tmpwatch ignores symlinks, won't switch filesystems and only
removes empty directories and regular files.
