Development version of the FreeBSD 5.x pkg_install suite of tools

This version fixes some bugs of the -CURRENT tools. You should
only install it it you have problems with the current version
or want to test the new features.

If you want to replace the base system tools, install via:
  make install PREFIX=/usr
You can revert to the normal tools simply by uninstalling the
port or restoring them with:
  cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/pkg_install; make install
if you have the sources installed.
