wemux enhances tmux to make multi-user terminal multiplexing both easier and
more powerful. It allows users to host a wemux server and have clients join in
either:

 * Mirror Mode gives clients (another SSH user on your machine) read-only access
   to the session, allowing them to see you work, or
 * Pair Mode allows the client and yourself to work in the same terminal (shared
   cursor)
 * Rogue Mode allows the client to pair or work independently in another window
   (separate cursors) in the same tmux session.

It features multi-server support as well as user listing and notifications when
users attach/detach.
