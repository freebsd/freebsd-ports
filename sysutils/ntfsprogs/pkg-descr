The goals of the Linux-NTFS project are to develop reliable and full feature
access to NTFS by the Linux kernel driver and by a user space driver
(ntfsmount), and to provide a wide collection of NTFS utilities and a
developer's library for other GPLed programs. We have already achieved a lot,
with high quality results. Includes the following:

ntfsmount: fast, reliable, read/write, userspace.
ntfsprogs: various tools for managing ntfs, namely mkntfs, ntfsresize,
           ntfsclone, ntfsfix, ntfsundelete, ntfswipe and ntfsdecrypt.
