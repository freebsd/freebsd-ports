This tool removes blocks of 0x00 from files by replacing them with
phantomblocks. That way, a file uses less diskspace while its contents
hasn't changed at all!

BEWARE: after copying these files with tar, cp, cpio or any other tool,
the phantomblocks have been replaced with 0x00-blocks again!

EXAMPLE:

find / -type f -print | xargs -n 1 phantom -r -i

This would go trough the whole harddisk, scan all files and generate
0x00-blocks where necessary.
