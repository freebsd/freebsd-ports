The Thunar Volume Manager is an extension for the Thunar file manager,
which enables automatic management of removable drives and media.
For example, if thunar-volman is installed and configured properly,
and you plug in your digital camera, it will automatically launch
your preferred photo application and import the new pictures from the
camera into your photo collection.
