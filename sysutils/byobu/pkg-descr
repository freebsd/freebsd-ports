Byobu is a Japanese term for decorative, multi-panel screens that serve as
folding room dividers. As an open source project, Byobu is an elegant
enhancement of the otherwise functional, plain, practical GNU Screen. Byobu
includes an enhanced profile and configuration utilities for the GNU screen
window manager, such as toggle-able system status notifications.
