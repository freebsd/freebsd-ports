Tentakel is a simple program for executing the same command on many
hosts in parallel using ssh or rsh. It can make use of several sets of
hosts that are defined in files called "hostlists".

Tentakel tries to be as portable as possible - it uses plain bourne
shell code. It is also rather self-contained. Except the few external
programs it makes use of it should need almost no configuration or
setup on your system.
