stowES (stow Enhancement Script) is a Perl script which tries to ease the
use of the "stow" packaging program and software which can be compiled
and installed with autoconf. It automates the compilation and installation
of software packages by calling tar, configure, make, and stow with the
appropriate arguments.  Furthermore it helps maintaining your installed
software by creating library dependencies and checksums, and providing
various search functions. It is also possible to create tar-archives out
of your installed packages.
