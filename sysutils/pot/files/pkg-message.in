Now, before to run 'pot init', it would be wise to edit the configuration file

Do not edit pot.default.conf, but pot.conf instead.
Configuration files are stored in %%ETCDIR%%/

To upgrade from prevoius versions of pot (<0.6.0) to 0.6.0+ the following steps are suggested:
* stop all your pots
* re-run `pot init`
* if needed, restart pf

The variable `pot_list` in the rc.conf file is deprecated.
Use `pot set-attr` to enable the attribute start-at-boot to your pot
