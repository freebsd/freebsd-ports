Whowatch is an interactive who-like program that displays information about the
users currently logged on to the machine. In addition to standard information
(login name, tty, host, user's process), the type of the connection (telnet or
ssh) is shown. You can toggle display between the users' commands or idle times.
You can watch the process tree, navigate in it, and send INT and KILL signals.
