A *nix cross-platform (OS agnostic) supervisor

immortal runs a command or script detached from the controlling terminal
as a Unix daemon, it will supervise and restart the service if it has
been terminated. The service can be controlled by querying a Unix socket
"immortal.sock", this allows to remotely have full control over the service if
required by exposing the socket using a web server like Nginx.

immortal    - Starts and monitor a service
immortaldir - Directory to scan for services *.yml
immortalctl - Control existing services
