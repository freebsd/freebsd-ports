Chef Utils gem contains common code and mixins for the core Chef Infra Ruby
gems. This is intended to be a "core" or "foundations" library for the chef
ecosystem (and external related gems) which allows the use of core code and
utility functions of the chef gem without requiring all the heaviness of the
chef gem.
