istatserver is a daemon serving statistics to your iStat iPhone application
from Linux, Solaris & FreeBSD. istatserver collects data such as CPU, memory,
network and disk usage and keeps the history. Once connecting from the
iPhone and entering the lock code this data will be sent to the iPhone
and shown in fancy graphs.
