Utility to uninstall packages.
Unlike pkg_delete, pkg_remove removes all packages which depend to
the packages you specify, in proper order, by one command line.

For example:
# pkg_remove netscape
	Remove all netscape related packages.
# pkg_remove xemacs
	Same as above about xemacs.
# pkg_remove tiff
	Remove tiff library and whole packages which use it.
# pkg_remove '^ja-'
	Remove all japanese packages.
# pkg_remove ALL
	Remove all packages.
