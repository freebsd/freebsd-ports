Further configuration is required to connect salt and foreman-proxy, see:
http://theforeman.org/plugins/foreman_salt/

To upload reports from SaltStack highstates to Foreman, add a line like this to your /etc/crontab:
*/10 * * * * root /usr/local/sbin/upload-salt-reports >>/var/log/foreman-proxy/salt-cron.log 2>&1
