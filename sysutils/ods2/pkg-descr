From aaareadme.txt:

Say, what is this?
   ODS2 is a program to read VMS disk volumes written in VMS
   ODS2 format.

What can it do?
   Basically ODS2 provides cut down DIRECTORY, COPY and
   SEARCH commands for VMS volumes on non-VMS systems. These
   can be used to find out what is on a VMS volume, and copy
   files onto the local file sytem.

See aaareadme.txt and aaareadme.too for more information.
