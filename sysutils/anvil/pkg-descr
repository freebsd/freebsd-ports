Tools for distributing ssl certificates

Designed for FreeBSD (it uses fetch, not wget or curl [yet]).

It also uses sudo, with the goal of this running as non-root
and only allowing the cp & mv via sudo.

These tools were designed with acme.sh & Let's Encrypt in mind, 
but they should with with any certificates generated by any 
means.
