sslserver and sslclient are command-line tools for building SSL
client-server applications. They conform to the UNIX Client-Server
Program Interface, UCSPI.

sslserver listens for connections, and runs a program for each
connection it accepts. The program environment includes variables that
hold the local and remote host names, IP addresses, and port numbers.
sslserver offers a concurrency limit on acceptance of new connections,
and selective handling of connections based on client identity.

sslclient requests a connection to a TCP socket, and runs a program. The
program environment includes the same variables as for sslserver.
