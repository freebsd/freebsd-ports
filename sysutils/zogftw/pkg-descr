zogftw makes using multiple geli-encrypted single-vdev ZFS pools
for backups more convenient, mainly by automating creation, import
and export of such pools and by synchronizing datasets without the
user having to manually specify the names of the snapshots that
should be sent.

geli passphrases can be stored gpg-encrypted which allows importing
several pools in a row without having to specify each passphrase
manually.

zogftw is extendable in shell. It can be sourced from other shell
scripts or interactive shells.
