Genetic Algorithm File Fitter, or just GAFFitter, is a command-line software
written in C++ that arranges -- via a genetic algorithm -- an input list of
items or files/directories into volumes of a certain capacity (target), such
as CD or DVD, in a way that the total wastage is minimized.

By smartly arranging the input list, GAFFitter fits better the given items
and so optimizes (reduces) the number of required volumes to pack them.
