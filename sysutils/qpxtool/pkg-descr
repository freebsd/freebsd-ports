QPxTool is the linux way to get full control over your CD/DVD drives.
It is the Open Source Solution which intends to give you access to
all available Quality Checks (Q-Checks) on written and blank media,
that are available for your drive. This will help you to find the
right media and the optimized writing speed for your hardware, which
will increase the change for a long data lifetime.

These tests are actually supported:
* PIE / PIF Scan
* TA Scan
* Jitter / Beta Scan
* Transfer Rate Scan
* C1-, C2- and CU-Scan
* Blank Media Quality Check
* FE/TE Scan on blank media
* FE/TE Scan on written media

See webpage to get a list of the currently supported hardware.
