Podman (Pod Manager) is a fully featured container engine that is a
simple daemonless tool.  Podman provides a Docker-CLI comparable
command line that eases the transition from other container engines
and allows the management of pods, containers and images.  Simply put:
alias docker=podman.

Podman uses Buildah(1) internally to create container images.  Both
tools share image (not container) storage, hence each can use or
manipulate images (but not containers) created by the other.
