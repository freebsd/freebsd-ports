Cfengine, or the configuration engine is an agent/software robot and a
very high level language for building expert systems to administrate
and configure large computer networks. Cfengine uses the idea of
classes and a primitive form of intelligence to define and automate
the configuration and maintenance of system state, for small to huge
configurations. Cfengine is designed to be a part of a computer immune
system.
