HFSExplorer is an application that can read Mac-formatted hard disks and disk
images. It can read the file systems HFS (Mac OS Standard), HFS+ (Mac OS
Extended) and HFSX (Mac OS Extended with case sensitive file names).

HFSExplorer allows you to browse your Mac volumes with a graphical file system
browser, extract files (copy to hard disk), view detailed information about the
volume and create disk images from the volume.
HFSExplorer can also read most .dmg disk images created on a Mac, including zlib
/ bzip2 compressed images and AES-128 encrypted images. It supports the
partition schemes Master Boot Record, GUID Partition Table and Apple Partition
Map natively.
