   Backup Copy is basically a smart copy program that allows a user
to copy mass files from one place to another.  When coping over a
previous copy, the key features will allow coping only of new or
non existing files in the backup.  This results in saving time and
less load on the drive.  Built into the same feature of copying
new files only, is a file removal procedure.  If a file is removed
from the source path, the same file will be removed when the next
backup is performed.  This provides a backup that is exactly the same
as the source without filling up the drive.  As an added option, all
files that will be overwritten or deleted when doing a copy over a
previous backup, have the opportunity to be stored in a trash bin.
You can leave this trash bin to grow and grow just in case you need a
backup of your backup.  When you start running out of disk space you
will need to remove or clean up the trash bin.
