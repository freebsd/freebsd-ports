The cryptographic hash function BLAKE2 is an improved version of the SHA-3
finalist BLAKE. Like SHA-3, BLAKE2 offers the highest security, yet is fast as
MD5 on 64-bit platforms and requires at least 33% less RAM than SHA-2 or SHA-3
on low-end systems. The core algorithm of BLAKE2 is derived from ChaCha, a
stream cipher designed by Daniel J. Bernstein that has been proposed as a
standard cipher for TLS.
