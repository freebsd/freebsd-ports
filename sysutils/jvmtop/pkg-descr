Jvmtop is a lightweight console application to monitor all accessible, running
jvms on a machine. In a top-like manner, it displays JVM internal metrics
(e.g. memory information) of running java processes.

It's tested with different releases of Oracle JDK, IBM JDK and OpenJDK on
FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris and Windows hosts.  Jvmtop requires a JDK - a JRE
will not suffice.
