Maintain and replicate ZFS snapshots

zap automates the management of zfs snapshots.  With a few, simple
crontab entries, it can be used to create a comprehensive zfs backup
system.  There are no configuration files.  All parameters are supplied
on the command line or in zfs properties and all snapshot information
is stored in snapshot names.

zap plays nice with manually created snapshots or snapshots from other
tools.  It will only operate on snapshots it creates.
