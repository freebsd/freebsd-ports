Solaar is a device manager for Logitech's Unifying Receiver.  It is
able to pair/unpair devices to the receiver, and for most devices read
battery status.

It comes in two flavors, command-line and GUI.  Both are able to list
the devices paired to a Unifying Receiver, show detailed info for each
device, and also pair/unpair supported devices with the receiver.
