KDar is the KDE Disk Archiver. It is a convenient graphical interface
to Denis Corbin's libdar archiving and backup C++ library. You can
safely backup (with compression if you like), view and restore files
using KDar, along with a few easy UNIX commands for mounting and
burning CD-R's, Zip and Jazz drives, DVD-R's, floppies, or any other
disk-based storage media.
The KDar project was started by Johnathan K. Burchill, Ph.D., and it 
is hosted by SourceForge.net.
