inotify-tools is a set of command-line utilities that provides a simple
interface to the inotify kernel subsystem. It allows users to monitor and react
to changes in files and directories in real-time.

The package includes two main utilities:
- inotifywait: for continuous monitoring and real-time output of
  filesystem events. It is often used in shell scripts to trigger
  actions like deployments, backups, or log monitoring.
- inotifywatch: gathers filesystem access statistics and outputs a
  summary count of events received on each file or directory. It is
  suitable for short-term monitoring to collect event statistics.
