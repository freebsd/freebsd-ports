ldapvi is tool to update LDAP entries with a text editor.

It is:
# Written in C.
# Reasonably fast and small. The ldapvi client needs about as much time for
  receiving entries as the OpenLDAP server needs to sends them, which should be
  fast enough.
# Shows a summary of changes before committing them. Details of the changes can
  be previewed in LDIF format.
# Uses an LDIF-like format in the editor (which should be easier to use
  interactively than standard LDIF).
# Can rename entries.
# Does not give up easily. On error, you can edit the file again or rebind to
  the server and try again.
