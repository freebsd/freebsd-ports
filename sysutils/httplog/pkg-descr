httplog is a replacement for Apache's 'rotatelogs' and Andrew Ford's
'chronolog'. It allows you to specify a logfile using strftime paramaters in
the filename to act as a template. This means that the logs in your logfiles
will also be sorted according to the filename. For example, if you specify a
logfile of /var/log/http%Y%m%d.log, a new log file would be generated each day,
with content for only that one day. It also supports compression of logfiles
using gzip, and many other useful functions.
