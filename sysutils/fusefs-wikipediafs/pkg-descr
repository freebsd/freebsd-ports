WikipediaFS is a mountable Linux virtual file system that allows to
read and edit articles from Wikipedia (or any Mediawiki-based site) as
if they were real files.

It is thus possible to view and edit articles using your favourite
text-editor. Text-editors tend to be more convenient than a simple
browser form when it comes to editing large texts and they generally
include useful features such as Mediawiki syntax highlighting and spell
checking.
