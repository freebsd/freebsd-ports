A collection of programs that can be used in a debian/rules file to automate
common tasks related to building debian packages. Programs are included to
install various files into your package, compress files, fix file permissions,
integrate your package with the debian menu system, debconf, doc-base, etc.
Most debian packages use debhelper as part of their build process.
