debhelper is a collection of programs that can be used in a debian/rules file to
automate common tasks related to building binary debian packages. Programs are
included to install various files into your package, compress files, fix file
permissions, integrate your package with the debian menu system, etc. This will
be of use only to debian developers or others who wish to build debian packages.
