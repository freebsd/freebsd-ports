A database upgrade is required if upgrading from Bacula < 9.0.
See %%DATADIR%%/update_bacula_tables

An auto-changer manipulation script based on FreeBSDs
chio command is included and installed at

  %%PREFIX%%/sbin/chio-bacula

Please have a look at it if you want to use an
autochanger. You have to configure the usage in

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf

Take care of correct permissions for changer and
tape device (e.g. /dev/ch0 and /dev/n[r]sa0) i.e.
they must be accessible by user bacula.

Due to lack of some features in the FreeBSD tape driver
implementation you MUST add some OS dependent options to
the bacula-sd.conf file:

  Hardware End of Medium = no;
  Backward Space Record  = no;
  Backward Space File    = no;

With 2 filemarks at EOT (see man mt):
  Fast Forward Space File = no;
  BSF at EOM = yes;
  TWO EOF    = yes;

With 1 filemarks at EOT (see man mt):
  Fast Forward Space File = yes;
  BSF at EOM = no;
  TWO EOF   = no;

NOTE: YOU CAN SWITCH EOT model ONLY when starting
      from scratch with EMPTY tapes.

It is also important that all the scripts accessed
by RunBeforeJob and RunAfterJob will be executed by
the user bacula.  Check your permissions.

For USB support read the bacula manual. It could be necessary
to configure/compile a new kernel.

Look at %%PREFIX%%/share/bacula/update_bacula_tables for
database update procedure. Details can be found in the
ReleaseNotes

If you are using sqlite you need to run the make_sqlite_tables script as
the bacula user. Do this using 'sudo su -m bacula'.
