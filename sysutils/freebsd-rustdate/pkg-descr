freebsd-rustdate is a reimplementation of freebsd-update.sh.  It's
significantly faster (often by an order of magnitude or more), hopefully
more maintainable, and has a few extra features.  It's close to drop-in
compatible for most simple uses, but online help or the website should be
consulted for details.
