The kldpatch utility can print or alter the content of device/quirk tables
in kernel modules. These tables are generally used to identify devices,
and possibly apply specific quirks to enable/disable certain features.

Kldpatch is especially useful to let the kernel recognise a new device
without rebooting and rebuilding/reinstalling kernel or modules.
