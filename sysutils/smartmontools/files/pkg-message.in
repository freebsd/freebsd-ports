To check the status of drives, use the following:

	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/smartctl -a /dev/ad0	for first ATA/SATA drive

	%%PREFIX%%/sbin/smartctl -a /dev/ada0	for first SATA drive

To include drive health information in your daily status reports,
add a line like the following to /etc/periodic.conf:
	daily_status_smart_devices="/dev/ad0 /dev/da0"
substituting the appropriate device names for your SMART-capable disks.

To enable drive monitoring, you can use %%PREFIX%%/sbin/smartd.
A sample configuration file has been installed as

Copy this file to %%PREFIX%%/etc/smartd.conf and edit appropriately

To have smartd start at boot
