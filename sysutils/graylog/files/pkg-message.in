  message: <<EOM
Please see %%ETCDIR%% for sample versions of graylog.conf, log4j.xml, and
and adjust them for your configuration.

For GeoIP support you need to install the net/GeoIP port and
configure the path to the GeoIP databases in the Graylog Web Interface.

When running graylog in a jail, you need to set enforce_statfs for the jail.

For a single-node installation, install:

- databases/mongodb70 or databases/mongodb80
- textproc/opensearch between 2.0 to 2.9 inclusive

And ensure that the elasticsearch cluster name matches that used by graylog.

{ type: upgrade
  message: <<EOM
Graylog v7.0 requires significant preparation to migrate both to newer
MongoDB and to switch from older ElasticSearch to the new OpenSearch.

You may need to re-index OpenSearch after migrating, refer to upstream
docs for more details.

https://go2docs.graylog.org/current/upgrading_graylog/upgrade_to_graylog_7.0.htm

- databases/mongodb70 or databases/mongodb80
- textproc/opensearch between 2.0 to 2.9 inclusive

Remember to backup both MongoDB & ES/OS databases before upgrading Graylog
itself.

Beginning with v4.0, Graylog Open Source is licensed under the
Server Side Public License (SSPL). For more details, see
https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl

If you are running on a dual-stack (ipv4+ipv6) system, you may need to
include the additional JVM tuning parameter:

    -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
