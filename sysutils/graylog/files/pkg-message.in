Please see %%ETCDIR%% for sample versions of graylog.conf, log4j.xml, and
and adjust them for your configuration.

For GeoIP support you need to install the net/GeoIP port and
configure the path to the GeoIP databases in the Graylog Web Interface.

When running graylog in a jail, you need to set enforce_statfs for the jail.

For a single-node installation, install:

- databases/mongodb50 or higher
- textproc/opensearch 1.3, 2.0 or higher

And ensure that the elasticsearch cluster name matches that used by graylog.

See https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-0/downloading_and_installing_graylog/installing_graylog.html

{ type: upgrade
  message: <<EOM
Graylog v5.0 requires significant preparation to migrate both to newer
MongoDB and to switch from older ElasticSearch to the new OpenSearch.

You may need to re-index OpenSearch after migrating, refer to upstream
docs for more details.

https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-0/upgrading_graylog/upgrading_to_graylog_5.0.x.htm

- textproc/opensearch 1.3, 2.0 or higher
- databases/mongodb50 or higher

Remember to backup both MongoDB & ES/OS databases before upgrading Graylog
itself.

Beginning with v4.0, Graylog Open Source is licensed under the
Server Side Public License (SSPL). For more details, see
https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl

If you are running on a dual-stack (ipv4+ipv6) system, you may need to
include the additional JVM tuning parameter:

    -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
