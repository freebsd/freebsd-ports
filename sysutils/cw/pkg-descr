cw is a non-intrusive real-time ANSI color wrapper for common Unix-based
command.

cw is designed to simulate the environment of the commands being
executed, so that if a person types 'du', 'df', 'ping', etc.  in their
shell it will automatically color the output in real-time according to
a definition file containing the color format desired.  cw has support
for wildcard match coloring, tokenized coloring, headers/footers, case
scenario coloring, command line dependent definition coloring, and
includes over 50 pre-made definition files.
