.TH PKG_CUTLEAVES 1 "Jul 2003" FreeBSD
.SH NAME
pkg_cutleaves \- deinstall 'leaf' packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pkg_cutleaves [-c] [-l] [-x] [-R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pkg_cutleaves
finds installed 'leaf' packages, i.e. packages that are not referenced
by any other installed package, and lets you decide for each one if you
want to keep or deinstall it (via pkg_deinstall(1)).
Once the packages marked for removal have been flushed/deinstalled,
you'll be asked if you want to do another run (to see packages that have
become 'leaves' now because you've deinstalled the package(s) that
depended on them). In every run you will be shown only packages that you
haven't marked for keeping, yet.

Note that your package registry database should be up to date for this
to work properly, so it might be a good idea to run pkgdb(1) before
running pkg_cutleaves.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -c
When listing leaf packages, also print their comments/short
descriptions. Will be ignored unless the '-l' parameter is given, too.
.IP -l
List leaf packages only, one per line, and don't ask for anything to be
deinstalled.
.IP -x
Exclude packages matching expressions given in the exclude file.
.IP -R
Run 'pkg_deinstall -R' instead of plain 'pkg_deinstall', so packages the
removed leaf packages depend(ed) on will be deinstalled, too.
.SH FILES
.I /usr/local/etc/pkg_leaves.exclude
.RS
An optional list for excluding packages when the '-x' option is given.
If the beginning of a package's name matches any line (except comment or
empty lines) in this file, the package will not be listed/offered for
removal (e.g., a line saying just 'XFree86' (without the 's) will
exclude all packages with names starting with 'XFree86').
