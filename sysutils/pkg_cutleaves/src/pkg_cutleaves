# Interactive script for deinstalling "leaf" packages;
# requires the portupgrade tools
#
# Syntax: pkg_cutleaves [-c] [-F] [-l] [-R] [-x]
# Options:
#   -c: Show comments, too; only works with '-l' (ignored otherwise)
#   -F: Fix package db after each deinstallation run (via 'pkgdb -F')
#   -l: List leaf packages only, don't ask if they should be deinstalled
#   -R: Run 'pkg_deinstall -R' instead of plain 'pkg_deinstall'
#   -x: Honor exclude list in $excludefile
