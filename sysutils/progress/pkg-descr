This tool can be described as a tiny, dirty C command that looks for
coreutils basic commands (cp, mv, dd, tar, gzip/gunzip, cat, etc.)
currently running on your system and displays the percentage of copied
data. It can also show estimated time and throughput, and provides a
"top-like" mode (monitoring).
