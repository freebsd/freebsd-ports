The FreeSBIE port is a collection of scripts which
help a user to create CDs/DVDs containing a complete
operating system based on FreeBSD.
It is used as "live-cd" and boots straight from CD.
Consequent use of filesystem compressing techniques allow to
include a huge number of applications on a single disc.

Creation of the CDs/DVDs is completely dialog based as well as
building and installing of packages.
