lscpu gathers CPU architecture information about the current CPU. The
command output is optimized for parsing or for easy readability by
humans. The information includes, for example, the number of CPUs,
threads, cores, and sockets.

There is also information about the CPU caches, family, model,
byte order, and stepping.
