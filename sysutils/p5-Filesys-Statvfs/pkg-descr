Interface for statvfs() and fstatvfs()

Unless you need access to the bsize, flag, and namemax values, you should 
probably look at using Filesys::DfPortable or Filesys::Df instead.

The statvfs() and fstatvfs() functions will return a list of values, or 
will return undef and set $! if there was an error.

The values returned are described in the statvfs header or the statvfs() 
man page.

The module assumes that if you have statvfs(), fstatvfs() will also be 
available.
