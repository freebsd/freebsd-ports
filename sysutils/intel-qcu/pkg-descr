The Intel(R) QSFP+ Configuration Utility is a command line utility that allows 
users to change the link type of the installed QSFP+ module. The supported 
types are defined within the adapter's NVM. This utility displays only the 
devices that potentially support QSFP+ reconfiguration. Only one port per 
device is displayed, since changes affect the device as a whole, not individual
ports.
