try-rs is a CLI tool designed to manage the chaos of temporary projects.
Instead of cluttering your Desktop or /tmp with test1, new-test, and
final-test, try-rs organizes them into date-prefixed directories, offering
a robust TUI (Terminal User Interface) to create, navigate, and clean up your
experiments.
