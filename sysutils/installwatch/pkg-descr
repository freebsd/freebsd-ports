Installwatch is a simple utility which keeps track of which files
are created and modified during the installation of a new program.
It's fast and easy to use. It doesn't require a "pre-install" phase
because it monitors processes while they run.
Installwatch works with every dynamically linked ELF program,
by intercepting system calls that cause file system alterations.
