Installwatch is a simple utility which keeps track of which files 
are created and modified during the installation of a new program. 
It's fast and easy to use. It doesn't require a "pre-install" phase 
because it monitors processes while they run. 
Installwatch works with every dynamically linked ELF program, 
by intercepting system calls that cause file system alterations.
