Docker is the world's leading software container platform. Developers use
Docker to eliminate "works on my machine" problems when collaborating on code
with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in
isolated containers to get better compute density. Enterprises use Docker to
build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more
securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server apps.
