Bhyvemgr is a bhyve management GUI written in Freepascal/Lazarus for FreeBSD.
It needs a bunch of tools mostly installed on base system and some installed
from ports/packages. Currently it supports amd64 and aarch64. The main goal is
to be a desktop user application to easily and quickly setup and run virtual
machines on the FreeBSD host.
