Unless this file already existed, a sample configuration file
has been placed in %%ETCDIR%%/munin-node.conf.

Please edit it according to your needs.

The Munin client will *not* be started automatically. To allow it
to start, put this line in /etc/rc.conf:

munin_node_enable="YES"

Then, it will be started on the next boot. If this line is already
present, the client will be started now.  Otherwise, edit
/etc/rc.conf and execute this command:

    %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/munin-node start

For a list of plugins that will probably work run
%%PREFIX%%/sbin/munin-node-configure --suggest

If this is a fresh install run
%%PREFIX%%/sbin/munin-node-configure --shell | sh -x
to install the plugins automatically
