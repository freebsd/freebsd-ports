screenFetch is a "Bash Screenshot Information Tool". This handy Bash script can
be used to generate one of those nifty terminal theme information + ASCII
distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots nowadays. It will
auto-detect your distribution and display an ASCII version of that
distribution's logo and some valuable information to the right. There are
options to specify no ascii art, colors, taking a screenshot upon displaying
info, and even customizing the screenshot command! This script is very easy to
add to and can easily be extended.
