In order to mount locally a remote archive or an entire repository as a FUSE
filesystem, it is required to load fusefs(5) module:

# kldload fusefs

To load the module at boot time, add fusefs(5) module

to /etc/rc.conf by running:

# sysrc kld_list+=fusefs

Also, if you plan to mount restic repositories as non root user, you need to run

# sysctl vfs.usermount=1

and add the line

vfs.usermount=1

to /etc/sysctl.conf to ensure the setting is applied at boot time.
