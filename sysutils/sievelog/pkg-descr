Sievelog is a message dispatcher inspired by swatch but more focused on the
following problems:

    * Having a clean syntax
    * Directing a raw syslog stream to different files based on content
    * Mailing out alerts based on content
    * Being fast

Sievelog's syntax is as simple as "<regex>" -> /some/file.
