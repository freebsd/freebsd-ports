htop is an enhanced version of top, the interactive process viewer,
which can display the list of processes in a tree form.

Comparison between 'htop' and 'top'

	* In 'htop' you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally
	to see all processes and full command lines.
	* In 'top' you are subject to a delay for each unassigned
	key you press (especially annoying when multi-key escape
	sequences are triggered by accident).
	* 'htop' starts faster ('top' seems to collect data for a while
	before displaying anything).
	* In 'htop' you don't need to type the process number to
	kill a process, in 'top' you do.
	* In 'htop' you don't need to type the process number or
	the priority value to renice a process, in 'top' you do.
	* In 'htop' you can kill multiple processes at once.
	* 'top' is older, hence, more tested.
