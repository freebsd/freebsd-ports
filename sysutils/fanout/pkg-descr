Fanout and fanterm are two utilities that allow you to run commands on 
multiple machines. The difference is that fanout only runs non-interactive 
commands (like dd, cat, adduser, uname -a, etc.) and pipelines built of 
these. The output is collected into a single display that can be viewed by 
less or redirected to a file.

Fanterm, on the other hand, allows you to run interactive text mode 
commands on multiple machines at the same time. Your keystrokes are sent 
to a shell or application running on each of the target systems. The 
output from each system is shown in a seperate xterm.
