Puppet-lint checks your Puppet manifests against the Puppet Labs style
guide and alerts you to any discrepancies.

You can test a single manifest file by running:

	puppet-lint <path to file>

If you want to test your entire Puppet manifest directory, you can add
require 'puppet-lint/tasks/puppet-lint' to your Rakefile and then run:

	rake lint
