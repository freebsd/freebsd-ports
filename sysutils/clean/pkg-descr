The clean utility searches through the filesystem for "temporary files"
left behind by editors and the like which can be deleted safely.

WARNING: This program was written with the express purpose of deleting
(unwanted) files.  Please be certain that you understand this program
and that you really want to use such an automatic deletion process
before you begin.

[ On the other hand, I've been using it for over ten years without
doing anything worse than not having a core.1 manpage.  The normal
mode is interactive and prompts for confirmation.  You are advised to
have backups before using the non-interactive batch mode. ]
