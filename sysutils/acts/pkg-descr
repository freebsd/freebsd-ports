acts is a minimal shell script that creates backups with Tarsnap.
Some design goals:

    Just backup, no restore.
    Calendar-based (daily, monthly, yearly) backup schedule
    Portable, small code footprint.

One Tarsnap archive is created per-target per-run. 31 daily, 12 monthly,
and indefinite yearly backups are kept.
