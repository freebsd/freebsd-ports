This package contains the binary release of xperfmon++ V1.33 a X based
system performance meter for several systems, ported to FreeBSD 2.X.

The program monitors user-, system-, idle-cputime, free swap, disk io,
number of interrupts, network-input, -output, -collision packets and
NFS client and server activity.

Please send BUGS and annotations to: Lars_Koeller@odie.physik2.uni-rostock.de

Major changes in xperfmon++ V1.3 due to xperfmon++ V1.1:

	- Clean fix of the -geometry option bug, now there is only
	  a MIN_WIDTH of 185 pixels. The MIN_HEIGTH is calculated
	  dynamically out of the number of active graphs.
	- Display 'Free Swap' in percent without resizing of the graph
	- Close some memory leaks
	- Display unit of graph in label field.

Changes from xperfmon++ V1.3 to xperfmon++ V1.33:

	- Fix event bug when resizing or moving the window.
	  (High cpu consumption when running xperfmon++ with mwm)
	- Changes in get_swapspace to compile with FreeBSD 2.2 (-current)
