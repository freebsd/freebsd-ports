Intel's Active Management Technology is a simple embedded subsystem
that helps you manage remote servers.  In particular you can power off
or reset a remote system, regardless of the state of the operating
system.

amtc is a tool to efficiently monitor, power-control on a scheduled
basis and interactively manage a bigger bunch of PCs equipped with
Intel vPro technology, distributed over several rooms. Having a
practical tool for this purpose massively eases system management
procedures, from scheduled, unattended OS-re-installs to individual,
interactive remote power management needs.
