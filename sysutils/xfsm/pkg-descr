xfsm stands for X File System Monitor and runs under MIT's X11
window system on several flavors of UNIX. It is a tool designed
to make monitoring your file systems' status easy by displaying
a simple bar graph for each file system greater than size 0. It
updates the file systems' statistics at regular, user definable
intervals.
