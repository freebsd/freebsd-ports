WARNING - BREAKING CHANGES WITH THE ZREPL 0.1.X RELEASE:
There are a number of breaking changes this release. To ensure zrepl
continues to function correctly, ensure you read the changelog, and then
perform the following on both sides of the replication:
- Stop the zrepl service:    # service zrepl stop
- Upgrade the zrepl package: # pkg upgrade zrepl
- Modify the zrepl config:   # vi %%PREFIX%%/etc/zrepl/zrepl.yml
- Check the configuration:   # service zrepl configtest
- Start the zrepl service:   # service zrepl start
- Monitor the zrepl service: # zrepl status

DANGER - SNAPSHOT PRUNING REQUIRES EXPLICIT KEEP RULES:
For any ZFS snapshot that you want to keep, at least one rule must match. This
is different from previous releases where pruning only affected snapshots with
the configured snapshotting prefix. Make sure that snapshots to be kept or
ignored by zrepl are covered, e.g. by using the regex keep rule.
This also applies to snapshots taken by means other than zrepl (e.g. manually).
