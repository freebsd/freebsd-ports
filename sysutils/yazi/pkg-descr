Yazi (means "duck") is a terminal file manager written in Rust, based on
non-blocking async I/O. It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and
customizable file management experience.

Features:

  - Full Asynchronous Support: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks
    are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.
  - Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management: Provides real-time progress
    updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.
  - Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols: Also integrated with
    Ueberzug++, covering almost all terminals.
  - Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding: Combined with the
    pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.
  - Concurrent Plugin System: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI),
    functional plugins (coming soon), custom previewer, and custom preloader;
    Just some pieces of Lua.
  - Integration with fd, rg, fzf, zoxide
  - Vim-like input/select component, auto-completion for cd paths
  - Multi-Tab Support, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives,
    directories, code, etc.)
  - Bulk Renaming, Visual Mode, File Chooser
  - Theme System, Custom Layouts, Trash Bin, CSI u
  - ... and more!
