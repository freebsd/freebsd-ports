Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine
that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire
stack. OPA is a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
(CNCF).

Use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines,
API gateways, and more. OPA decouples policy decision-making from the
application's business logic. Policies are written in a high-level
declarative language called Rego.
