Superfile is a terminal file manager, allowing you to manage files on
the terminal in much the same way as you would do in a graphical file
manager.

Superfile works best if you use one of the Nerd Fonts as your terminal
font.  Install x11-fonts/nerd-fonts on your client and set up one of
these fonts if you encounter graphical glitches.
