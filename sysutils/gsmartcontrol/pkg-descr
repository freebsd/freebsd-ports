GSmartControl is a graphical user interface for smartctl (from
sysutils/smartmontools port), which is a tool for querying and
controlling SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting
Technology) data on modern hard disk drives. It allows you to
inspect the drive's SMART data to determine its health, as well
as run various tests on it.
