keyd has several unique features many of which are traditionally only
found in custom keyboard firmware like QMK as well as some which are
unique to keyd. Some of the more interesting ones include:

- Layers (with support for hybrid modifiers).
- Key overloading (different behaviour on tap/hold).
- Keyboard specific configuration.
- Instantaneous remapping (no more flashing :)).
- A client-server model that facilitates scripting and display server
  agnostic application remapping. (Currently ships with support for X,
  sway, and gnome).
- System wide config (works in a VT).
- First class support for modifier overloading.
- Unicode support.
