xe is a tool for constructing command lines from file listings or
arguments, which includes the best features of xargs(1) and apply(1).

Benefits over xargs:
- Sane defaults (behaves like xargs -d'\n' -I{} -n1 -r).
- No weird parsing, arguments are separated linewise or by NUL byte.
- Can also take arguments from command-line.
- No shell involved unless -s is used.
- {} replacing possible with multiple arguments.
