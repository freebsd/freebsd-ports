mkdesktop is a Bourne script that helps to standardize the process of FreeBSD
desktop installation as much as possible per user, with plenty of flexibility as
well as modularity. By default, you get 5 distinct stages for defining your
desktop environment. But you can always add/subtract/customize the stages as
much as you wish. Once you start using mkdesktop, you will pretty soon love it -
particularly its post-processor which automatically kicks in once the stages
have been processed - it sets up emulation layers and configuration of system
files, if the user so desires.
