To activate the new printing system do the following:

- save your old printcap (`cp /etc/printcap /etc/printcap.save')
- set `lpd_enable=NO' in /etc/rc.conf
- run checkpc -f to make sure that necessary files have been created
- reboot or kill the old lpd (`killall lpd') and
  start the new one (`@@PREFIX@@/sbin/lpd')
- remember to adjust your aliases or your PATH to use the new programs

Note that LPRng uses /etc/printcap, /etc/lpd.conf, and /etc/lpd.perms
