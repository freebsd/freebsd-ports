Rustic is a backup tool that provides fast, encrypted, deduplicated backups.

It reads and writes the restic repo format described in the design document and
can be used as a restic replacement in most cases.

It is implemented in Rust, a performant, memory-efficient, and reliable
cross-platform systems programming language.

Stability

Rustic currently is in beta state and misses regression tests. It is not
recommended to use it for production backups, yet.
