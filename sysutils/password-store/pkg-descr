Password management should be simple and follow Unix philosophy. With pass, each
password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose filename is the title of the
website or resource that requires the password. These encrypted files may be
organized into meaningful folder hierarchies, copied from computer to computer,
and, in general, manipulated using standard command line file management
utilities.

pass makes managing these individual password files extremely easy. All
passwords live in ~/.password-store, and pass provides some nice commands for
adding, editing, generating, and retrieving passwords. It is a very short and
simple shell script. It's capable of temporarily putting passwords on your
clipboard and tracking password changes using git.

You can edit the password store using ordinary Unix shell commands alongside the
pass command. There are no funky file formats or new paradigms to learn. There
is bash completion so that you can simply hit tab to fill in names.
