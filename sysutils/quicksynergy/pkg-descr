QuickSynergy is a graphical interface (GUI) for easily configuring
Synergy2, an application that allows the user to share his mouse and
keyboard between two or more computers.

Without the need for any external hardware, Synergy2 uses the TCP-IP
protocol to share the resources, even between machines with diferent
operating systems, such as Mac OS, Linux and Windows.
