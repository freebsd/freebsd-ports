Ori is a distributed file system built for offline operation and empowers the
user with control over synchronization operations and conflict resolution. We
provide history through light weight snapshots and allow users to verify the
history has not been tampered with. Through the use of replication instances
can be resilient and recover damaged data from other nodes.
