# Bacula interface to mtx autoloader
# (By Lars Köller, lars+bacula@koellers.net)
#
#  If you set in your Device resource
#
#  Changer Command = "path-to-this-script/chio-bacula" %c %o %S %a
#    you will have the following input to this script:
#
#  chio-bacula "changer-device" "command" "slot" "archive-device" "drive-index"
#                  $1              $2       $3        $4               $5
#  for example:
#
#  chio-bacula /dev/sg0 load 1 /dev/nst0 0     (on a FreeBSD system)
#
#  If you need to to an offline, refer to the drive as $4
#    e.g.   mt -f $f offline
#
#  Many changers need an offline after the unload. Also many
#   changers need a sleep 60 after the mtx load.
#
#  N.B. If you change the script, take care to return either
#   the mtx exit code or a 0. If the script exits with a non-zero
#   exit code, Bacula will assume the request failed.
