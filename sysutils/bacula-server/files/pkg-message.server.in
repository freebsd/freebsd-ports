NOTE:

An auto-changer manipulation script based on FreeBSDs
chio command is included and installed at

  %%PREFIX%%/sbin/chio-bacula

Please have a look at it if you want to use an
autochanger. You have to configure the usage in

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/bacula-dir.conf

Take care of correct permissions for changer and
tape device (e.g. /dev/ch0 and /dev/n[r]sa0) i.e.
they must be accessible by user bacula.

Due to lack of some features in the FreeBSD tape driver
implementation you MUST add some OS dependent options to
the bacula-sd.conf file:

  Hardware End of Medium = no;
  Backward Space Record  = no;
  Backward Space File    = no;

With 2 filemarks at EOT (see man mt):
  Fast Forward Space File = no;
  BSF at EOM = yes;
  TWO EOF    = yes;

With 1 filemarks at EOT (see man mt):
  Fast Forward Space File = yes;
  BSF at EOM = no;
  TWO EOF   = no;

NOTE: YOU CAN SWITCH EOT model ONLY when starting
      from scratch with EMPTY tapes.

It is also important that all the scripts accessed
by RunBeforeJob and RunAfterJob will be executed by
the user bacula.  Check your permissions.

For USB support read the bacula manual. It could be necessary
to configure/compile a new kernel.

Look at %%PREFIX%%/share/bacula/update_bacula_tables for
database update procedure. Details can be found in the
ReleaseNotes

  Please read this file:

	%%DOCSDIR%%/ReleaseNotes

  as installed by docs port for the upgrade procedure.

IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTES FOR THIS RELEASE:

As always, both the Director and Storage daemon must be upgraded at
the same time, and on any given machine, you must run only one version
of Bacula. This means that on the Director and Storage daemon machines,
you *must* upgrade your File daemon as well.

New database Catalog format in version 5.0.2 (3.1.9 or later).

If upgrading to 5.x from < 5.x, you must run the update_bacula_tables
script.  Afterwards, check the ownership on any new tables
and make sure they are consisten with existing tables.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOTE FOR 5.0.0 USERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Allow Duplicate Jobs directive has been significantly-
reworked, and the default value has changed. See below.

Truncate On Purge has been totally rewritten. See the new
features section of the manual.

When Volume Poll Interval is set in the SD DEVICE configuration,
(default 5 mins), after a certain number of polling tries (approx
10) polling will stop and the operator will be asked to
resolve the problem.  Previously there was no limit, and an
error message could be produced at each poll attempt.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Read the ReleaseNotes for further information.

If you are using sqlite you need to run the make_sqlite_tables script as
the bacula user. Do this using 'sudo su -m bacula'.
