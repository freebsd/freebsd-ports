Ever wished the compactness of shell scripts be put into a real programming
language? Say hello to Plumbum Shell Combinators. Plumbum (Latin for lead, which
was used to create pipes back in the day) is a small yet feature-rich library
for shell script-like programs in Python. The motto of the library is ?Never
write shell scripts again?, and thus it attempts to mimic the shell syntax
(shell combinators) where it makes sense, while keeping it all Pythonic and
cross-platform.

Apart from shell-like syntax and handy shortcuts, the library provides local and
 remote command execution (over SSH), local and remote file-system paths, easy
working-directory and environment manipulation, and a programmatic Command-Line
Interface (CLI) application toolkit. Now let?s see some code!
