To change the personality of your system at system boot
you have to add the following line into the /etc/rc script.

[ -x %%PREFIX%%/sbin/personality ] && %%PREFIX%%/sbin/personality menu 60

Make sure that you add this after mounting of the ufs filesystems.
If you prefer you can use other values than 60 seconds.
After 60 seconds the system boots with the last configuration.
