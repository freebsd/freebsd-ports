This port automates the creation of a bootable CD-ROM which contains a
full FreeBSD installation.  Also included is a script for installing a
FreeBSD release, as built by 'make release'.  If desired, a floppy
disk with a /etc directory may be provided to supply system /etc
overrides allowing one to use the same CD image to boot multiple
systems, where each system's hostname, IP address, etc is contained on
a separate floppy disk.  See the README file for more information.
