regather is an LDAP syncrepl consumer which can generate (re-gather) files,
create or delete directories, etc. based on LDAP syncrepl events.

It uses Net::LDAP(3) to do all LDAP related stuff and Template to generate
files.  Configuration file is processed with Config::Parser.

For example, regather can re-write each OpenVPN client configuration file
on changes to client LDAP configured data, or re-write CRL file on update
in LDAP, or change sieve script for mail user.
