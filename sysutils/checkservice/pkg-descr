Checkservice is written, as the name of the program suggests, to
check the status of the services that you run on your own or a
remote server/computer. It can monitor for example the FTP Server
and Web server you are running and alarm you in several ways if
something is wrong with them. 

The variety of output types, check- & warningplugins make Checkservice
suitable for many tasks. With simple configfiles you can scan
important services on the local host, but also on remote hosts, and
make sure you know if a vital service fails! Since the 0.9.9-release
Checkservice supports grouping. This is a convenient way to organize
the hosts to check in different categories.
