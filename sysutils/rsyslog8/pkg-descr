RSYSLOG is the rocket-fast system for log processing.

It offers high-performance, great security features and a modular
design. While it started as a regular syslogd, rsyslog has evolved
into a kind of swiss army knife of logging, being able to accept
inputs from a wide variety of sources, transform them, and output to
the results to diverse destinations.

RSYSLOG can deliver over one million messages per second to local
destinations when limited processing is applied (based on v7, December
2013). Even with remote destinations and more elaborate processing the
performance is usually considered "stunning".
