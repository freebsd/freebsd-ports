libchk is a tool to help users obtain the following information:

  - A list of executables that have unresolvable shared library links

  - A list of shared libraries that are not referenced by any binary

  - A list of binaries for each shared library that are linked with
    the library

This will help to get a hint as to if you can safely remove shared
libraries that look obsolete.
