JailAdmin is a system for managing a set of named jails.  It provides:
 - A command line utility for starting and stopping named jails.
 - An efficient method for shutting down a large number of jails in
   parallel.
 - A simple configuration syntax.
 - SNMP monitoring facilities.
It is designed to provide more flexible functionality than FreeBSD's own
rc.d/jail script, and should provide a complete superset of features.
