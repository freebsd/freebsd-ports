	Several years ago, dc42wrap was created to produce open-source operating
system boot floppies for a PC that could not boot from CD-ROM, in an environment
where the only physically accessible machines with floppy disk drives were Apple
Macintoshes.

"raw" disk image -> FTP -> dc42wrap
FTP -> [Macintosh OS 7/8/9] -> physical floppy

	When Apple stopped including floppy drives in their hardware, this
software fell into disuse, until someone needed to copy the contents of an
ancient pile of HFS-formatted floppies onto a floppy drive-less Macintosh
running OS X, and the only physically accessible machines with floppy disk
drives were PCs running an open-source operating system.
	Even though Apple now uses NDIF as their preferred disk image format,
modern software still understands DiskCopy 4.2 files, and OS X will happily
mount those old HFS images on the desktop.

physical floppy -> dd -> dc42wrap
SSH -> [Macintosh OS X] -> mounted filesystem
