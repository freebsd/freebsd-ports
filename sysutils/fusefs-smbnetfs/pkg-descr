SMBNetFS is a filesystem that allow you to use samba/microsoft network
in the same manner as the network neighborhood in Microsoft Windows.

Featuries:
    * you can use Samba/Microsoft network as a regular Unix filesystem
    * workgroup/computer/share entries are dynamically created
    * Windows domain supported
    * kerberos support (New)
    * user defined workgroup/link/hosts are supported
    * national character supported
    * in config files you can specify different user/password to access
      different network shares
    * you can access any computer in the world by "cd mountpoint/ip-addr"
      command, where "ip-addr" is the IP address of the desired computer. Do
      not warry that there is no file with such name :-)
    * command "cd mountpoint/username:password@computer_or_ip" allows
      you to access "computer_or_ip" as user "username" with password
      "password" (this is insecure, but usefull)
