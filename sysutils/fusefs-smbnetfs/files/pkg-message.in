===>  Basic Instructions:

After kldload fusefs.ko and setting
	# sysctl vfs.usermount=1

you should make .smb directory in your homedir:
	% mkdir ~/.smb

Copy your smb.conf (usually in %%PREFIX%%/etc/) and
%%DOCSDIR%%/smbnetfs.conf to this directory:
	% cp %%PREFIX%%/etc/smb.conf %%DOCSDIR%%/smbnetfs.conf ~/.smb/

Make mountpoint for smb network and mount it:
	% mkdir ~/mountpoint
	% smbnetfs ~/mountpoint

Now you can get access to smb shares in your network, for example:
	% cd ~/mountpoint/ip-addr

XXX Note, use of Gnome keyring was replaced in version 0.6.1 with
XXX libsecret, which this port does not enable by default.
