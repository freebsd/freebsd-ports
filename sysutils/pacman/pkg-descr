pacman is a utility which manages software packages in Linux. It
uses simple compressed files as a package format, and maintains a
text-based package database (more of a hierarchy), just in case
some hand tweaking is necessary.

pacman does not strive to "do everything." It will add, remove and
upgrade packages in the system, and it will allow you to query the
package database for installed packages, files and owners. It also
attempts to handle dependencies automatically and can download
packages from a remote server.
