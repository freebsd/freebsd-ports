To run zfs-replicate, copy /usr/local/share/zfs-replicate/config.sample.sh to
/usr/local/share/zfs-replicate/config.sh, customize to your environment, and 
run using "zfs-replicate -c /usr/local/share/zfs-replicate/config.sh"

The only option that does not have a default, and needs to be set is the REPLICATE_SETS

To check last log, run "zfs-replicate -c /usr/local/share/zfs-replicate/config.sh -s"
