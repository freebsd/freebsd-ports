Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd with a focus on
security and reliability.

Among others, it offers support for on-demand disk buffering,
reliable syslog over TCP, SSL, TLS and RELP, writing to databases
(MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and many more), email alerting, fully
configurable output formats (including high-precision timestamps),
the ability to filter on any part of the syslog message, on-the-wire
message compression, and the ability to convert text files to syslog.

It is a drop-in replacement for stock syslogd and able to work with
the same configuration file syntax. Its advanced features make it
suitable for enterprise-class, encryption protected syslog relay
chains while at the same time being very easy to setup for the
novice user.
