OpenIPMI was designed to aid building "complex IPMI management software".
OpenIPMI library will connect with an IPMI controller, detect any
management controllers on the bus, get their SDRs, manage all the
entities in the system, manage the event log, and a host of other
things. OpenIPMI is also dynamic and event-driven. It will come up
and start discovering things in the managed system. As it discovers
things, it will report them to the software using it (assuming the
software has asked for this reporting).
