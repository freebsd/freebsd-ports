This module sends syslog messages over a network socket. It works like
Sys::Syslog in setlogsock's 'udp', 'tcp', or 'unix' modes, but without
the significant CPU overhead of that module when used for high-volume
logging. Use of this specialized module is only recommended if 1) you
must use network syslog as a messaging transport but 2) need to
minimize the time spent in the logger.
