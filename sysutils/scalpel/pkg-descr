Scalpel is a fast file carver that reads a database of header and footer
definitions and extracts matching files or data fragments from a set of
image files or raw device files.
Scalpel is filesystem-independent and will carve files from
FATx, NTFS, ext2/3, HFS+, or raw partitions.
It is useful for both digital forensics investigation and file recovery.
