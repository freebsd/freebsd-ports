container-diff is a tool for analyzing and comparing container images.

container-diff can examine images along several different criteria, including:
- Docker Image History
- Image file system
- Apt packages
- pip packages
- npm packages

These analyses can be performed on a single image, or a diff can be performed on
two images to compare. The tool can help users better understand what is
changing inside their images, and give them a better look at what their images
contain.
