   Foremost is a console program to recover files based on their headers
   and footers. Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated
   by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and
   footers are specified by a configuration file, so you can pick and
   choose which headers you want to look for.
