RyzenAdj is a tool to view and adjust power management settings for some of
Ryzen mobile and embedded CPUs.

One of the use cases is to "trade" CPU performance for lower temperature:
You can set lower-than-default CPU power limit and make your computer
(slightly) less performant, but make it (significantly) cooler and more quiet
under load. It is not uncommon to get less than 10% performance drop after
lowering CPU TDP by 30%.

Another use case is for CPU overclocking hobby.

Use at your own risk.
