- isodump (dump a device or file based on ISO-9660)
- isoinfo (analyze or list an ISO-9660 image)
- isovfy (verify an ISO-9660 image)
- mkisofs (an ISO-9660 filesystem image creator)
- mkhybrid (an ISO-9660/HFS filesystem image creator)
  Link to mkisofs.
- readcd (a data CD reading and recording program)
  May be used to to write to DVD-RAM and to copy Solaris boot CD's.
- scgcheck (checks and validates the ABI of libscg)
- rscsi (daemon providing access to local SCSI-devices over the network)

This port applies a third-party patch to the ISO-9660 tools which has
support for the following character sets (used with the '-input-charset'
option):
big5 cp1250 cp1251 cp1255 cp437 cp737 cp775 cp850 cp852 cp855 cp857 cp860
cp861 cp862 cp863 cp864 cp865 cp866 cp869 cp874 cp932 cp936 cp949 cp950
euc-jp euc-kr gb2312 iso8859-1 iso8859-13 iso8859-14 iso8859-15 iso8859-2
iso8859-3 iso8859-4 iso8859-5 iso8859-6 iso8859-7 iso8859-8 iso8859-9 koi8-r
