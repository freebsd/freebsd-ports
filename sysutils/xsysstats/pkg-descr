XSysStats is a system information display tool similar to perfmeter.  It
displays its information in the form of a strip chart.  It can also display
information about remote hosts, as perfmeter can do.

XSysStats can display any number of graphs at one time in the same window.
Information being displayed in the window need not be all of the same host.
For example, you could have it display the percentage of cpu being utilized
of half a dozen (or more) different hosts.  Also, splitting the window
into smaller windows is now supported (similar to what the perfmeter
in OW 3 allows)
