PowerChute Network Shutdown (PowerChute) works in conjunction with the UPS
Network Management Card (NMC) to provide network-based shutdown of multiple
computer systems.

In the case of a UPS critical event, the software performs a graceful,
unattended system shutdown before the UPS battery is exhausted. The number of
protected systems is limited only by the capacity of the UPS.
