rar2fs is a FUSE based file system that can mount a source RAR
archive/volume or a directory containing any number of RAR
archives and access (read only) the contents as plain files/directories.
Other files located in the source directory are handled transparently.
Both compressed and non-compressed archives/volumes are supported but
full media seek support (aka. indexing) is only available for
non-compressed plaintext archives.
