From the README:
    Lavaps is an interactive process-tracking program like ``top'',
    but with a much different attitude. Rather than presenting lots of
    specific info in digital form, it tries to present certain important
    information in a graphical analog form. The idea is that you can
    run it in the background and get a rough idea of what's happening
    to your system without devoting much concentration to the task.

    Lavaps was inspired by Mark Weiser's idea of calm computing in
    this paper:

    ``The Coming Age of Calm Technology'' by Mark Weiser
    and John Seely Brown.  A revised version of Weiser &
    Brown. ``Designing Calm Technology'', PowerGrid Journal, v 1.01,
    http://powergrid.electriciti.com/1.01 (July 1996).  October,
    1996.  http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/acmfuture2endnote.htm.
    (This program dedicated to the memory of M.W.--I hope you would have
    thought it a good hack.)
