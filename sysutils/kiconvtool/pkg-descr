On FreeBSD, it's possible to allow plain users to mount filesystems
without using su or sudo. This is enabled via vfs.usermount sysctl.
However, if file name conversion is used when mounting a filesystem,
in most cases mount will fail with `mount_XXX: XXX_iconv: Operation
not permitted denied' error. This is caused by the fact that character
set conversion tables need to be loaded into kernel, but, apart
from mounting, that's not allowed to plain users, because charset
tables are large enough to initiate a denial of service by filling
kernel memory with many tables.

This utility allows you to load only specific charset tables into
kernel, so usermounts with file name conversions won't fail and in
the same time it's not possible to bring the system down by filling
kernel memory.
