If you want to run logstash-forwarder, add to /etc/rc.conf

	logstash_forwarder_enable="YES"

Do not forget to edit your configuration file:

	Default: ${PREFIX}/etc/logstash-forwarder.conf

Key points

You'll need an SSL CA to verify the server (host) with.
You can specify custom fields for each set of paths in the config file.
Any number of these may be specified. I use them to set fields like type
and other custom attributes relevant to each log.

Generating an ssl certificate

Logstash supports all certificates, including self-signed certificates.
To generate a certificate, you can run the following command:

	$ openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout \
	logstash-forwarder.key -out logstash-forwarder.crt -days 365

This will generate a key at logstash-forwarder.key and the 1-year valid
certificate at logstash-forwarder.crt. Both the server that is running
logstash-forwarder as well as the logstash instances receiving logs will
require these files on disk to verify the authenticity of messages.

PROTECT YOUR KEYS!
