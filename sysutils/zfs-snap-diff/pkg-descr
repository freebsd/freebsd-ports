With zfs-snap-diff you can explore file differences and restore changes from 
older file versions in different zfs snapshots. You can restore the whole file 
from an older version, or select single changes to revert in the 'diff' view.

zfs-snap-diff has a web frontend, so it can run on your local work machine or 
on your remote file / backup server (no Xserver necessary).
