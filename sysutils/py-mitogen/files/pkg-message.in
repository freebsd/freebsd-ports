If you are intending to use mitogen together with [sysutils/ansible]
then simply append this into your ansible.cfg file, whether in /etc
or in the root directory of your ansible playbook:

[defaults]
strategy         = mitogen_linear
strategy_plugins = %%PYTHON_SITELIBDIR%%/ansible_mitogen/plugins/strategy
