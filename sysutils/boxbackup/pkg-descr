This is a port of Box Backup, an online backup daemon

The backup daemon, bbackupd, runs on all machines to be backed up. The
store server daemon, bbstored runs on a central server. Data is sent
to the store server, which stores all data on local filesystems, that
is, only on local hard drives. Tape or other archive media is not
used.

The system is designed to be easy to set up and run, and cheap to use.
Once set up, there should be no need for user or administrative
intervention, apart from usual system maintenance.
