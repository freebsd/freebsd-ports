GUI application used to monitor UPS devices controlled by the APCUPSD package.
The program uses the NIS interface from apcupsd to collect event and status
information for display to the end-user.  Because of this great interface,
this program can be executed on any OS supported machine and use the network
socket interface to connect back to apcupsd.
