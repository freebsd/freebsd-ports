Runit is a daemontools replacement with the following features:

- Service supervision
- Clean process state
- Reliable logging facility
- Fast system bootup and shutdown
- Packaging friendly
- Small code size

This very experimental port comes with a complete suite of
configuration files and services to replace init(8) and rc(8) with
runit for initializing your system.  Heavily inspired by Void Linux'
init scripts.
