XOsview is an application originally developed by Mike Romberg for 
Linux.  It can be summarized as a graphical performance meter, and 
it looks similar in appearance to the zoomy performance meters to 
be found on various other platforms.  

The FreeBSD version works but doesn't yet have full functionality.  
At the time of this writing, the meters that work are the Load meter,
the CPU meter and the memmeter.  The other nonfunctional meters are
not displayed.  Someone who understands how to grab statistics out 
of the kernel needs to volunteer to help make this a fully functional
port!
