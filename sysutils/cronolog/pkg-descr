"cronolog" is a simple program that reads log messages from its input
and writes them to a set of output files, the names of which are
constructed using template and the current date and time.

"cronolog" is intended to be used in conjunction with a Web server, such
as Apache to split the access log into daily or monthly logs. E.g.:

	TransferLog "|/www/sbin/cronolog /www/logs/%Y/%m/%d/access.log"
	ErrorLog    "|/www/sbin/cronolog /www/logs/%Y/%m/%d/errors.log"

would instruct Apache to pipe its access and error log messages into
separate copies of cronolog, which would create new log files each day
in a directory hierarchy structured by date, i.e. on 31 December 1996
messages would be written to:

	/www/logs/1996/12/31/access.log
	/www/logs/1996/12/31/errors.log

After midnight the following files would be used:

	/www/logs/1997/01/01/access.log
	/www/logs/1997/01/01/errors.log
