U-Boot loader for OrangePi Zero.

To install this bootloader on an sdcard just do :
dd if=/usr/local/share/u-boot/u-boot-orangepi-zero/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/path/to/sdcarddevice bs=1k seek=8 conv=notrunc,sync

This version is patched so that:
 * ELF and API features are enabled.
 * The default environment is trimmed to just what's needed to boot.
 * The saveenv command writes to the file u-boot.env on the FAT partition.
 * The DTB file name is chosen based on the board model and passed to ubldr.bin
   using the fdtfile env variable. ubldr.bin loads the DTB from /boot/dtb/ on
   the FreeBSD partition.
 * By default, it loads PIE ubldr.bin from file ubldr.bin on the FAT partition
   to address 0x42000000, and launches it.
