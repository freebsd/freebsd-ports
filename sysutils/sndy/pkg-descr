sndy - is an audio switching program that allows you to redirect sound output to
any port of your computer.

The buttons in the program correspond to the init line in your /dev/sndstat.
Pressing the button toggles the sound output with the sysctl command
hw.snd.default_unit=<X>. Do not switch audio output during playback
of a single audio file. The OSS sound system can only play sound to one device
at a time. Therefore, you need to wait for the end or completion of the previous
sound file before switching.

The scroll bar can be used to change the volume level. The volume
is changed using the mixer vol <indicator>*10 command. That is, each digit
from 0 to 10 multiplied by 10 corresponds to a percentage of volume.

The selected pcm is only saved until you reboot. To save the default sound
output, add hw.snd.default_unit=<number> to the system file /etc/sysctl.conf
