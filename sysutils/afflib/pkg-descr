The Advanced Forensic Format (AFF) is an emerging standard for storing computer
forensic information. Critical features of AFF include:

  - AFF allows you to store both computer forensic data and associated metadata
    in one or more files.

  - AFF allows files to be digital singed, to provide for chain-of-custody and
    long-term file integrity.

  - AFF allows for forensic disk images to stored encrypted and decrypted
    on-the-fly for processing. This allows disk images containing privacy
    sensitive material to be stored on the Internet.

  - AFF is an open format unencumbered by copyright or patent protection. The
    AFFLIB library that implements AFF is available for use in both Open Source
    and proprietary tools.
