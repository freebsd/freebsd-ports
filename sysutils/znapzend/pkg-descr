ZnapZend is a ZFS centric backup tool.
It relies on snapshot, send and recieve to do its work.
It has the built-in ability to manage both local
snapshots as well as remote copies by thinning them out
as time progresses.

The ZnapZend configuration is stored as properties in
the ZFS filesystem itself.
