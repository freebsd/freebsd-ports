pass-coffin is a pass extension that hides password store data inside a GPG
encrypted file, which we'll call a coffin.

Because of how pass works, directory and file names aren't encrypted by default
and anyone who has access to your computer can see which websites you use and
your usernames on those websites. This is different from how password managers
like keepassxc work by keeping your entire password store database inside an
encrypted file and can also automatically lock access to the application itself
after a certain amount of time. pass-coffin has been created to provide these
missing features to pass.
