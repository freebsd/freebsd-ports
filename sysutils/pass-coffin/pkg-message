*** Please Create Backups or Use Git ***

Before using this extension or any other password store extension, It is highly
recommend that you check in your password store in a local git repository and
sync it with a remote git repository (doesn't have to be an online remote repo)
or make regular backups of your password store using tools like borgbackup. You
don't want to lose your password store data because of an unintentional bug in
this, or any other, pass extension.

Use `pass git initʼ to initialize a local git repository in your password store
and add a remote git repository using `pass git remote add backup <location>ʼ.
For more details, please read the "EXTENDED GIT EXAMPLE" section of the man
page of pass.
