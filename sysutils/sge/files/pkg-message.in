After installation, you need to set up SGE.  Go to 

	%%PREFIX%%/%%SGE_BASE%%

and run 'install_qmaster' to set up the master node of the cluster and
run 'install_execd' for the back-end compute nodes.

If you desire extra security, add the -csp flag to your qmaster install.

If you wish to run PVM applications with SGE you will need to build a
couple of binaries.  Go to

	%%PREFIX%%/%%SGE_BASE%%/pvm/src 

and type './aimk' followed by './install.sh'.  See the documentation for
how to set up a pvm environment.
