Burn.app is a GNUstep based CD burning program for GNU/Linux.
It serves as front-end for J. Schilling's cdrtools, cdrdao,
and cdparanoia.
You will no longer need to remember ugly command line parameters
for cdrecord or write shell scripts. With Burn.app you compile
your CD by point-and-click operation and save your projects for
later reuse. Burn.app will hide as many settings as possible from you,
thus making it very easy and user-friendly to create your own CDs.
