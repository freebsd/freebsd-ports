OpenHPI provides an open source implementation of the Service Availability
Forum (SAF) Hardware Platform Interface (HPI).

HPI is an abstracted interface for managing computer hardware, typically
chassis and rack based servers.  HPI includes resource modeling; access to
and control over sensor, control, watchdog, and inventory data associated
with resources; abstracted System Event Log interfaces; hardware events and
alarms; and a managed hotswap interface.
