libretto-config - Libretto BIOS Setting Program

 The `libretto-config' is a utility program to configure the BIOS
setting of the mini notebook computer, Toshiba Libretto. Changes to
the setting are immediately done, so rebooting is not necessary.
  I don't know whether these programs work on any other machines but
Libretto. In case of Toshiba's notebook machines, some function may
work.

 The original program were written by Mr. Iizuka
(PXN02133@niftyserve.or.jp), which rewrite the CMOS setting directly.
Mr. Nomura (GBB00111@niftyserve.or.jp) have extended the program to
support SMI and BIOS calling. Thanks.
 I, Ishioka, combined programs to the package. If you have any troubles,
bug reports, or requests, please notify me.
