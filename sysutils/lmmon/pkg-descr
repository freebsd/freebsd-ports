lmmon

This program displays information gathered from a motherboard
power management controller (e.g. LM78/79).  Displayed values
include fan speeds, motherboard temperature, and various
voltages.  By default it cycles once per second using a curses-
based display.

Currently, the /dev/smb0 interface is only supported in FreeBSD
3.3-STABLE (after 01 November 1999), 4.x, and 5.x; however, the
/dev/io interface may work with many motherboards in FreeBSD
3.x and some non-LM78/79 motherboards.

In addition, lmmon supports simple text output that can be easily
used by external programs (e.g. UCD SNMP Daemon) for monitoring.
