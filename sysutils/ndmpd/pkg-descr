The ndmpd daemon handles client Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP)
requests.

NDMP is an open, enterprise-wide, network-based data management protocol
used for backup and recovery. The ndmpd daemon enables users to manage
data backup and recovery using Data Management Application (DMA) clients.

The NDMP protocol is used to coordinate data movement and control
between a DMA and an NDMP server or between two NDMP servers.
