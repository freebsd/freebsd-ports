Zellij is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who
loves the terminal. At its core, it is a terminal multiplexer (similar to tmux
and screen), but this is merely its infrastructure layer.

Zellij includes a layout system, and a plugin system allowing one to create
plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.
