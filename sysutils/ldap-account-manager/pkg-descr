LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries (e.g. users,
groups, DHCP settings) stored in an LDAP directory. LAM was designed to make
LDAP management as easy as possible for the user. It abstracts from the
technical details of LDAP and allows persons without technical background to
manage LDAP entries. If needed, power users may still directly edit LDAP entries
via the integrated LDAP browser.

  phpGroupWare, Zarafa, DHCP, SSH keys, group of names and much more
