iogen is a lightweight tool that generates heavily fragmented I/O.  It
accomplishes this by forking a number of children that run I/O to a
filesystem.

This tool is intended to test storage stacks under stress and worst case
scenarios.  However due to heavy fragmentation of the I/O files, it tends
to bypass caching algorithms in storage stacks.
