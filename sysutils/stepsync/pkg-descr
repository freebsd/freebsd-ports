StepSync allows keeping two folders synchronized, it can be thus used as a
back-up utility.  It manages two trees, starting from a folder as root and
recursing in them, determines which files were added or removed or changed
(based on the last modification date), and distinctly allows to insert new
files, update, or delete.
