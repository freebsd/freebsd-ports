Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd supporting, among
others, syslog/tcp, permitted sender lists, filtering on any message
part, and fine grain output format control.  Its advanced features
make it suitable for enterprise-class, encryption protected syslog
relay chains while at the same time being very easy to setup for the
novice user.

The following features are supported through modules: logging to
MySQL, PostgreSQL, any libdbi-supported backend; SNMP trap sender, GSS
API, RELP.
