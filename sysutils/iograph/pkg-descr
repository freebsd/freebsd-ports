iograph counts network traffic for one interface and creates an accounting
statistic by summing up the transfered bytes. Statistics are created hourly,
daily and monthly and are saved as static HTML files.

It is written in pure C without the need of external libraries, targetted to
be used in an embedded firewall system. A HTTP server is not included.
