Fcron is a scheduler. It aims at replacing Vixie Cron, so it
implements most of its functionalities. But contrary to Vixie Cron,
fcron does not need your system to be up 7 days a week, 24 hours a
day : it also works well with systems which are not running neither
all the time nor regularly (contrary to anacrontab). To do so, fcron
allows you to use the standard mode in which you tell it to execute
one command at a given date and hour and to make it run a command
according to its time of execution, which is normally the same as
system up time.

This is the stable release.
