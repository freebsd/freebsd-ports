Written by Andre Lerche, this plugin checks the 
chosen mountpoint for free disk space.  
It displays 4 different icons (red, yellow, green, unknown) 
and a message box, depending on the free space. 
The amount of free disk space is visible in a tooltip. 
If you left-click on its icon, it opens the 
mountpoint directory in the file manager.
