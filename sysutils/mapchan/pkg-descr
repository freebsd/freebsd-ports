mapchan - A program which allows you to transform the input and output
of a terminal (including a serial port terminal).  It is useful when:

  * You need to work with various encodings on various virtual
    terminals
  * You have an assortment of terminals, not one of which supports
    your favorite encoding.

This software is an incomplete implementation of the functionality of
the utility "mapchan" of SCO Unix.
