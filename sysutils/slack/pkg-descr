slack is an evolution from the usual "put files in some central directory"
that is fairly common practice. It's descended from an earlier system its
author also wrote, called "subsets", and uses a multi-stage rsync to fix
some of the problems he had there.

Basically, it's a glorified wrapper around rsync.
