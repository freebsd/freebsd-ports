witr (why-is-this-running) is a diagnostic tool that explains the causal
chain of how and why a process came to exist on your system.

It answers questions like:
- Why is this running?
- How did it start?
- What is keeping it running?
- What context does it belong to?

witr supports querying by process name, PID, or port number, and provides
detailed information about process ancestry, service detection (systemd on
Linux, rc.d on FreeBSD), container detection (jails, docker), Git repository
context, and resource usage warnings.

Features:
- Zero configuration required
- Read-only and non-destructive
- Multiple output formats (standard, short, tree, JSON)
- FreeBSD native tools support (ps, procstat, sockstat, fstat)
- Works without procfs mounted
