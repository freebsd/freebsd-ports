Read the manual

  %%DOCSDIR%%/apcupsd.pdf

to do site specific configuration assigenments! Especially have a
detailed look into the chapter describing the shutdown procedure.

Sample files are installed in %%ETCDIR%%. These files
must be copied and/or configured for a proper working apcupsd.
You need to modify %%ETCDIR%%/apcupsd.conf as follows:

  For serial cable: DEVICE /dev/cuadX (or /dev/cuaaX for [45.]x)
  For USB cable: DEVICE (yes, leave it blank after DEVICE)

NOTE that for USB cable you must comment out the line

  device         uhid            # "Human Interface Devices"

in your kernel configuration file and recompile the kernel.
Your keyboard and mouse will still work.

WARNING USB support on FreeBSD is still considered BETA!

Add apcupsd_enable=YES to your /etc/rc.conf[.local] to have apcupsd
starting up at boot time.
