Now it is time to set-up the main configuration file.

First run "pyznap setup", a sample configuration will be copied
to %%ETCDIR%%/pyznap/pyznap.conf.

After configuring the file to your liking setup cron(8) with the
following entries:

*/15	*	*	*	*	root	%%BINDIR%%/pyznap snap >> /var/log/pyznap.log
0	0	*	*	*	root	%%BINDIR%%/pyznap send >> /var/log/pyznap.log
