pyznap is a ZFS snapshot management tool. It automatically takes and deletes
snapshots and can send them to different remote and local backup locations.

For example, it is possible to specify a policy for a given filesystem in the
pyznap.conf file and then use cron to let it run once per quarter-hour.
