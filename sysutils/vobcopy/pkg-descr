Vobcopy copies DVD .vob files to harddisk, decrypting them on the
way (thanks to libdvdread) and merges them into 2 GB files (or
larger) with the name extracted from the DVD. It checks for enough
free space on the destination drive and compares the copied size
to the size on DVD (in case something went wrong during the copying).
