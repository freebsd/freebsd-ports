The Ops Agent is the primary agent for collecting telemetry from your
Compute Engine instances.  Combining logging and metrics into a single
agent, the Ops Agent uses Fluent Bit for logs, which supports
high-throughput logging, and the OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics.
You can configure the Ops Agent to support parsing of log files from
third-party applications.
