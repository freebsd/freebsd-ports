Modern hard drives allow to set the amount of time a hard disk is
allowed to spend recovering from a read or write error. This feature
is called ERC (error recovery control, usually in Seagate), TLER
(time-limited error recovery, usually on Western Digital) or CCLT
(command completion time limit, usually on Samsung or Hitachi).

This rc.d script allows to set these valus on system startup to
tune disks for RAID usage.
