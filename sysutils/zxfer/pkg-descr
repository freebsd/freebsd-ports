Zxfer is a fork of zfs-replicate. It allows the easy and reliable backup,
restore or transfer of ZFS filesystems, either locally or remotely.

Some of the features zxfer has:
  * Written in sh with only one dependency, rsync. Rsync mode is not used
      in a typical restore, hence in that situation all you need is the
      zxfer script, your backup and an install CD/DVD.
  * Reliability is first priority - the only methods of transfer allowed
      are those that checksum/hash the transferred data.
  * Transfer to or from a remote host via ssh.
  * Recursive and incremental transfer of filesystems (via snapshots).
  * Transfer properties and sources of those properties (e.g. local or
      inherited).
  * Override properties in the transfer, e.g. for archival purposes
      it is useful to override "copies" and "compression".
  * Create all filesystems on the destination as necessary.
  * A comprehensive man page with examples.
  * Can be set to beep on error or when done, useful for long transfers.
  * Features an rsync mode for when two different snapshotting regimes are on
      source and destination, and zfs send/receive won't work.
