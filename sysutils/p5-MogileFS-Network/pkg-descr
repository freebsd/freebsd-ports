This collection of modules adds multiple network awareness to the MogileFS
server. It provides two replication policies, 'MultipleNetworks' and
'HostsPerNetwork', and also provides a plugin 'ZoneLocal' that causes
get_paths queries to be returned in a prioritized order based on locality of
storage.
