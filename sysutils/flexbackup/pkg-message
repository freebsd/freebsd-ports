--------------------- Flexbackup Configuration Information --------------------

Flexbackup needs to have its configuration file placed in /etc. A template
copy of this configuration file has been installed into

  ${PREFIX}/share/flexbackup/flexbackup.conf.sample

(where PREFIX nominally is /usr/local). Please copy this file as 

  /etc/flexbackup.conf

and edit appropriately for your site configuration.

Also see ${PREFIX}/share/flexbackup/flexbackup.README for more information on
how to use flexbackup (until the man pages are written :).
