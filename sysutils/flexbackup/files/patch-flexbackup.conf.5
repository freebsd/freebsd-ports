 Configure backup \(dqsets\(dq. Not needed if \(dq-dir <dir>\(dq is used to
-backup one tree at a time.  Each set is a simple space-separated list of
-filesystems/directories. Remote filesystems should be denoted as
-\(dqhost:directory\(dq.  You can use anything (other than \fI'all'\fR) as set
-names. Using \(dq-set all\(dq will back up all defined sets. If you are doing
-a full backup using tapes, each \(dqset\(dq will go onto a different tape and
-you will be prompted for tape change in between. Examples:

+Directories (local or remote) with spaces in their names should be enclosed in

+Multiple quoted directories included in a set should be space separated just
