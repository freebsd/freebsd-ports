 # Configure backup "sets".
 # Not needed if you use "-dir <dir>" to backup one tree at a time.
-# Each set is a simple space-separated list of filesystems
-# Remote filesystems should denoted as 'host:dir'
-# You can use anything (other than 'all') as set names
+# Each set is a simple space-separated list of filesystems.  Remote filesystems
+# should denoted as 'host:dir'.  If the filesystem name (local or remote)
+# contains spaces, then it should be enclosed in its entirety in double quotes.
+# Multiple quoted filesystems included in a set should be space separated just
+# like unquoted filesystem.  The Perl '.' string concatenation operator can be
+# used to split excessively long lines.
 #
-# Example:
-#  $set{'set1'} = "/home /usr";
-#  $set{'set2'} = "/dir3 machine2:/dir4 machine3:/dir5";
+# You can use anything (other than 'all') as set names.
+#
+# Examples:
+#  $set{'set1'} = '/home /usr';
+#  $set{'set2'} = '/dir3 machine2:/dir4 machine3:/dir5';
+#  $set{'set3'} =
+#      '"/mnt/winmachine1/Documents and Settings" ' .
+#      '"/mnt/winmachine1/Program Files"';
 #
 # "-set all" will back up all defined sets. If you are doing a full backup
 # using tapes, each "set" will go onto a different tape and you will be
 # prompted for tape change in between.

 # Subtree pruning

+# Key is a filesystem or host:dir spec as outlined above.
+# Regular expressions are allowed (not shell-type wildcards!)
+#
+# Note:  These "directories" are actually regular expressions and must
+# match "find" output relative to the path of the current backup set. This
+# means that different exclusions are needed for different backup sets.
+# This is a little tricky, so, read on.
+#
+# The regular expressions are processed by "find" but, before "find" is run,
+# FlexBackup changes into the base directory of the backup set in progress.
+# FlexBackup then runs "find" with a path of "." which means all output lines
+# start with "./".  To be helpful, FlexBackup packages each space-separated
+# prune directory as follows.  If you have a prune list like this
+#
+#     $prune{'/somedir'} = 'one two three';
+#
+# then, the constructed -regex argument to "find" looks like this
+#
+#     -regex "\./(one|two|three)"
+#
+# (with characters escaped as necessary depending on your environment).
+#
+# Another thing you need to know is that FlexBackup only uses the prune
+# terms that match the current base directory in the set you're backing
+# up.  For example, if your backup set definition looks like this
+#
+#     $set{'daily'} = '/home /root /var /usr';
+#
+# and you want to do some exclusions in "/home" and "/var" (but not the other
+# directories), you must set up a prune list for those two directories 
+# separately.  For example, to exclude bert's and ernie's home directories plus
+# /var/tmp, you would need the following:
+#
+#     $prune{'/home'} = 'bert ernie';
+#     $prune{'/var'}  = 'tmp';
+#
+# In particular, combining these *does not* work.  For example, this
+#
+#     $prune{'/'} = 'home/bert home/ernie var/tmp';
+#
+# doesn't work, unless, of course, your backup set is backing up "/", 
+# which our example is not.
+#
+# Like the $set configuration item, special handling is required for
+# directories with spaces in them.  Double quotes should surround pruning
+# targets but not the key.  Example:
+#
+#     $prune{'/mnt/winmachine1/Documents and Settings'} =
+#         '"user1/Local Settings/Temp" user2';
+#
+# Many other complex and abstruse variations are possible.  Here's one 
+# interesting corner case.  If you want to preserve a directory but none of its
+# contents, you can do it.  Picking on ernie from our previous example, preserve
+# only his home directory:
+#
+#     $prune{'/home'} = 'ernie/.*';
+#
