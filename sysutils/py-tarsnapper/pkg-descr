A wrapper around tarsnap which does two things:

* Lets you define "backup jobs" (tarsnap invocations) in a config file,
  though on it's own this has little advantage over just using a a
  shell script.
* The ability to expire old backups using a Grandfather-father-son
  backup scheme. This feature can be used in conjunction with tarsnapper
  backup jobs, or standalone, to be applied to any existing set of
  tarsnap backup archives, regardless of how they have been created.
