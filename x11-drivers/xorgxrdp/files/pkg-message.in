To configure hardware acceleration, follow the following steps.

    # sysrc kld_list="/boot/modules/i915kms.ko"
    # sysrc kld_list="/boot/modules/amdgpu.ko"
    # sysrc kld_list="/boot/modules/radeonkms.ko"

3. Ensure users who login via xrdp are member of the "video" group
    # pw groupmod video -m username|| pw groupmod wheel -m username

4. Edit /etc/X11/xrdp/xorg.conf to fit your environment
   "/dev/dri/renderD128" might be different depending on your environment.

   Find the following line and change it to the actual path.
    Option "DRMDevice" "/dev/dri/renderD128"

   Chenge "0" to "1" of the following line.
    Option "DRI3" "0"

5. Restart your system and login via xrdp
