EncFS is an encrypted pass-through filesystem which runs in userspace,
using the FUSE kernel module.  Similar in design to CFS and other
pass-through filesystems, all data is encrypted and stored in the
underlying filesystem.  Unlike loopback filesystems, there is no
predetermined or pre-allocated filesystem size.
