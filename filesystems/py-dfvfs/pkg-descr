dfVFS, or Digital Forensics Virtual File System, provides read-only access to
file-system objects from various storage media types and file formats.  The goal
of dfVFS is to provide a generic interface for accessing file-system objects,
for which it uses several back-ends that provide the actual implementation of
the various storage media types, volume systems and file systems.
