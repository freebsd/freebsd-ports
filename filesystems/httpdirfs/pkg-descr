HTTPDirFS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Directory Filesystem.

The performance of the program is excellent. HTTP connections are reused through
curl-multi interface. The FUSE component runs in the multithreaded mode.

There is a permanent cache system which can cache all the file segments you have
downloaded, so you don't need to these segments again if you access them
later. This feature is triggered by the --cache flag. This is similar to the
--vfs-cache-mode full feature of rclone mount

There is support for Airsonic / Subsonic server. This allows you to mount a
remote music collection locally.

If you only want to access a single file, there is also a simplified Single File
Mode. This can be especially useful if the web server does not present a HTTP
directory listing.
