KIO-Fuse allows you to mount remote directories into the root hierarchy of your
local file system, thereby exposing KDE's advanced access capabilities (SSH,
SAMBA/Windows, FTP, TAR/GZip/BZip2, WebDav, etc) to POSIX-compliant
applications such as Firefox, OpenOffice, GNOME apps, shell utilities and more.

KIO-Fuse works by acting as a bridge between KDE's KIO filesystem design and
FUSE.
