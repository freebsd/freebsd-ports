securefs is a filesystem in userspace (FUSE) with transparent encryption (when
writing) and decryption (when reading).

securefs mounts a regular directory onto a mount point. The mount point appears
as a regular filesystem, where one can read/write/create files, directories and
symbolic links. The underlying directory will be automatically updated to
contain the encrypted and authenticated contents.
