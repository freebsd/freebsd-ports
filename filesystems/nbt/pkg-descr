Named Binary Tag (NBT) is a binary format designed for and used by the game
Minecraft to store various data including worlds, player data and many other
things. This project provides a way to access those data by simply mounting
the corresponding data file as a file system, then reading and writing any
value as usual file system nodes.

NBT parser and writer are originally written by Lukas Niederbremer as cNBT
project which this project is based on.

This package provides the FUSE-based file system implementation, as well as
NBT maintenance command-line tools and library (cNBT).
