Versitygw requires at minimum a secret key and an access key to be specified,
either on the command line to run in the foreground, or as rc variables:

/usr/local/bin/versitygw \
	--access easy \
	--secret squirrel \
	--readonly \
	--port localhost:7070 \
	posix /var/empty

There are many additional parameters that can be specified, see the wiki at
https://github.com/versity/versitygw/wiki/ and --help output for details,
and add them to versitygw-options in your rc.conf.
