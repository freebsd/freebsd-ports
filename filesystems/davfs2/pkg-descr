Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to the
HTTP-protocol, allows authoring of resources on a remote web server.
davfs2 provides the ability to access such resources like a typical
filesystem, allowing for use by standard applications with no built-in
support for WebDAV.

davfs2 is designed to fully integrate into the filesystem semantics of
Unix-like systems and makes mounting by unprivileged users as easy and
secure as possible.

davfs2 does extensive caching to make the file system responsive, to
avoid unnecessary network traffic, to prevent data loss, and to cope
for slow or unreliable connections.
