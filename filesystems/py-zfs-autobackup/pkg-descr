This is a tool written to make replicating ZFS datasets easy and reliable.

You can either use it as a backup tool, replication tool or snapshot tool.
You can select what to backup by setting a custom ZFS property. This allows you
to set and forget: Configure it so it backups your entire pool, and you never
have to worry about backupping again. Even new datasets you create later will be
backupped. Other settings are just specified on the commandline. This also makes
it easier to setup and test zfs-autobackup and helps you fix all the issues you
might encounter. When you're done you can just copy/paste your command to a cron
or script.
Since its using ZFS commands, you can see what its actually doing by specifying
--debug. This also helps a lot if you run into some strange problem or error.
You can just copy-paste the command that fails and play around with it on the
commandline. (also something I missed in other tools)
An important feature thats missing from other tools is a reliable --test option:
This allows you to see what zfs-autobackup will do and tune your parameters. It
will do everything, except make changes to your zfs datasets. Another nice
thing is progress reporting: Its very useful with HUGE datasets,
when you want to know how many hours/days it will take. zfs-autobackup tries to
be the easiest to use backup tool for zfs.
