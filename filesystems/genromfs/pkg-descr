The mkfs equivalent for romfs filesystem. Port created for NuttX RTOS.
ROM FileSystem (ROMFS), read only filesystem, mainly for initial RAM
disks of installation disks.  Using this filesystem, you get a very
similar feature, and even the possibility of a small kernel, with a
file system which doesn't take up useful memory from the router
functions in the basement of your office.
