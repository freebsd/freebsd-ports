Ntfs2btrfs is a tool which does in-place conversion of Microsoft's NTFS
file system to the open-source file system Btrfs, much as btrfs-convert
does for ext2.  The original file system image is saved as a reflink copy
at `image/ntfs.img', and can be deleted to free up space if you want to
keep the conversion.
