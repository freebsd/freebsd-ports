jmtpfs is a FUSE and libmtp based filesystem for accessing MTP
(Media Transfer Protocol) devices. It was specifically designed for
exchaning files between Linux (and Mac OS X) systems and newer Android
devices that support MTP but not USB Mass Storage.

The goal is to create a well behaved filesystem, allowing tools like
find and rsync to work as expected. MTP file types are set automatically
based on file type detection using libmagic. Setting the file appears
to be necessary for some Android apps, like Gallery, to be able to find
and use the files.

Since it is meant as an Android file transfer utility, and I don't have
any non-Android MTP devices to test with, playlists and other non-file
based data are not supported.
