HFS is the "Hierarchical File System" used on modern Macintosh computers.
With this package, you can read and write Macintosh-formatted media such as
floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and SCSI hard disks on most Unix platforms.  You can
also format raw media or file into an HFS volume.

This package contains a number of different tools:

  - Several command-line programs (hmount, hls, hcopy, et al.)
  - Tk-based front-end for browsing and copying files through a
    variety of transfer modes (MacBinary, BinHex, text, etc.)
  - Tcl package and interface for scriptable access to volumes
  - C library for low-level access to volumes

Support for Apple's new Extended Format (HFS+) is currently not available.
