NTFS-3G has been installed.  It requires fusefs(5) support to operate,
so issue the ``kldload fusefs'' command or ``sysrc kld_list+=fusefs''
to make it load automatically when the system starts.

For further information, implementation details, and known issues see
the FreeBSD README (%%DOCSDIR%%/README.FreeBSD) in
addition to the official README (contains some Linux-specific parts).
