SquashFS is a highly compressed, read-only file system often used as
a root file system on embedded devices, live systems, or simply as a
compressed archive format.

This project originally started out as a fork of squashfs-tools 4.3,
after encountering some short comings and realizing that there have
been no updates on the SourceForge site or mailing list for a long
time.  Even before the first public release, the fork was replaced
with a complete re-write after growing frustrated with the existing
code base.

The utilities provided by squashfs-tools-ng offer alternative tooling
and are intentionally named differently, so both packages can be
installed side by side.

The actual guts of squashfs-tools-ng are encapsulated in a library
with a generic API designed to make SquashFS available to other
applications as an embeddable, extensible archive format (or simply
to read, write, or manipulate SquashFS file systems).
