This is read-only implementation of the XFS filesystem, a high-performance
64-bit journaling file system created by Silicon Graphics, Inc (SGI) in 1993,
and popular in various Linux distributions.

While the implementation is in early stages, it should be useful enough for
migration purposes.

This project runs in userland through the use of the FUSE kernel module. This is
the only run-time requirement.

This project was done as part of Google Summer of Code 2021.
