A plugin which enables the NTFS-3G FUSE driver to transparently read
from system-compressed files.

System compression, also known as "Compact OS", is a Windows feature
that allows rarely modified files to be compressed using the XPRESS or
LZX compression formats. It is implemented using reparse points. This
feature appeared in Windows 10 and many Windows 10 systems have been
using it by default.
