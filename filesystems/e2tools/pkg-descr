e2tools is a simple set of GPL'ed utilities to read, write, and
manipulate files in an ext2/ext3 filesystem. These utilities access a
filesystem directly using the ext2fs library. I wrote these tools in
order to copy files into a linux filesystem on a machine that does not
have ext2 support. Of course, they can also be used on a Linux machine
to read/write to disk images or floppies without having to mount them
or have root access.

Supported functionality:

 - copy files: e2cp
 - move files: e2mv
 - remove files: e2rm
 - create directory: e2mkdir
 - create hard links: e2ln
 - list files/directories: e2ls
 - output the last part of a file: e2tail
