CurlFtpFS is a filesystem for accessing FTP hosts based on FUSE and
libcurl.

CurlFtpFS differentiates itself from other FTP filesystems because it
features:

    * SSLv3 and TLSv1 support
    * connecting through tunneling HTTP proxies
    * automatically reconnection if the server times out
    * transform absolute symlinks to point back into the ftp file
      system
