Dancer is an IRC bot. A bot is an automated client for Internet Relay Chat
networks, which stays online after its owner leaves. It was designed to
protect and serve. Your faithful, strong (but humble) servant. Yes,
ladies. This is one bot who will not cheat on you. 

Dancer was developed in C, and is mostly POSIX compliant. It runs on
most of the UNIX flavors you have used, and a few you haven't heard of.
It also runs on Win32 and AmigaOS.
