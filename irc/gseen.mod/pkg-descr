gseen.mod

gseen works similar to countless seen scripts. It logs for each user
when he or she was last seen in the channel and makes this information
publically available. It takes switching nick names into consideration
and supports wildcards in search-requests.

The advantage of gseen in contrast to most other seen scripts is it's speed.
gseen can handle databases of several thousand nicks without a lag in seen
requests. It also supports several languages.
