BitchX is an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client by Colten Edwards aka
panasync@EFnet, it is based on its predecessors ircII and Epic.

BitchX was originally started as a script by Trench and HappyCrappy for
the popular Unix IRC client ircII.  Around Christmas of 1994 the script
was patched directly into the client by Colten Edwards.

BitchX includes features which make it a bot, bouncer, and a friendly
IRC client at the same time.

BitchX is one the most popular IRC clients among Unix systems.  It is
highly customizable and capable of running scripts, so it can be used
as an IRC bot too.
