This is a package of Infobot, by Kevin Lenzo

The infobot connects to an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server, joins
some channels (maybe), and begins accumulating factoids. To run one,
download the source, uncompress it, untar it, edit the config files,
and it up.

The default install dir is /usr/local/share/infobot-0.xx.x since it
doesn't really belong in the Perl tree, by default. If you want
it installed elsewhere,use the -p option to change the PREFIX.
