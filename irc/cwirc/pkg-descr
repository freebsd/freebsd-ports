CWirc is a plugin for the X-Chat IRC client to transmit raw morse code
over the internet using IRC servers as reflectors. The transmitted morse
code can be received in near real-time by other X-Chat clients with the CWirc
plugin. CWirc tries to emulate a standard amateur radio rig : it sends and
receives morse over virtual channels, and it can listen to multiple senders
transmitting on the same channel. Morse code is keyed locally using a
straight or iambic key connected to a serial port, or using the mouse buttons,
and the sound is played through the soundcard, or through an external sounder.
