ScrollZ is an IRC client based on ircII with many enhancements (colors,
userlists, enhanced scripting, and more). The main difference from other
clients is that it implements many useful features that you would normally find
in a script, thus making it faster than such scripts paired up with ircII.

It also has many unique features, such as three-line status bars, CDCC (which
has reget/resend ability), and its environment is highly customizable.
