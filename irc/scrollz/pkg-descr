ScrollZ is an IRC client based on ircII with many enhancements (colors,
userlists, enhanced scripting, and more). The main difference from
other clients is that it implements many useful features that you would
normally find in a script, thus making it faster than such scripts
paired up with ircII.

It also has many unique features, such as three-line status bars, CDCC
(which has reget/resend ability), and its environment is highly
customizable.
