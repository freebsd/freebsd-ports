ircd-ratbox-devel has been successfully installed.

Sample 'ircd.conf' and 'ircd.motd' files have been created in the
ircd-ratbox configuration directory. A sample configuration file is
included for EFNet-like configurations that can be used instead. You
should now edit these files as per the ratbox documentation.
A configured ircd.conf file is required to start the server.

Once you have added ircd_ratbox_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf, the
server can be started by running:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/ircd-ratbox start

You can check your ircd.conf configuration file for syntactical errors
using the following rc.d script command:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/ircd-ratbox conftest

An update of the ban.db database will be necessary if upgrading from a
pre-beta5 release. Those upgrading from 3.0.0-beta5 to this version
should be able to omit this step. Though it doesn't do any harm to check
anyway. Database updates must be performed using 'bantool -u' while no
ircd is running and before starting the newer version.

	%%PREFIX%%/bin/bantool -u

Be sure to check out 'ratbox-services' if you need a services package.
