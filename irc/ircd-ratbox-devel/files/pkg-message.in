ircd-ratbox-devel has been successfully installed.

Sample 'ircd.conf' and 'ircd.motd' files have been created in the
ircd-ratbox configuration directory. A sample configuration file is
included for EFNet-like configurations that can be used instead. You
should now edit these files as per the ratbox documentation.
A configured ircd.conf file is required to start the server.

Once you have added ircd_ratbox_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf, the
server can be started by running:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/ircd-ratbox start

You can check your ircd.conf configuration file for syntactical errors
using the following rc.d script command:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/ircd-ratbox conftest

The ban.db database can be checked and updated using 'bantool -u'.
For safety, updates should be done while no ircd is running and before
starting the new version.

	%%PREFIX%%/bin/bantool -u

Note that the ssl_only_channel compile option has been removed, and
should be added as a configuration setting (use_sslonly) in the
ircd.conf file in order to activate the +S channel mode.

Be sure to check out 'ratbox-services' if you need a services package.
