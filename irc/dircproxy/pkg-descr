dircproxy is an IRC proxy server designed for people who use IRC
from lots of different workstations or clients, but wish to remain
connected and see what they missed while they were away.  You connect
to IRC through dircproxy, and it keeps you connected to the server,
even after you detach your client from it.  While you're detached,
it logs channel and private messages as well as important events,
and when you re-attach it'll let you know what you missed.

This can be used to give you roughly the same functionality as
using ircII and screen together, except you can use whatever IRC
client you like, including X ones!

dircproxy has a whole host of features. Please read the file README in
the source distribution for a list.
