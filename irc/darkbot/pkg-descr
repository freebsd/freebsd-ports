Originally created  by Jason Hamilton  as an aid  for help
channels to answer  repeated questions  from its virtually
unlimited database, it has became  a  very popular talking
robot in a generic sense, being used all over IRC networks
for different  purposes and  in 18 languages.  Data can be
added to it  and  managed  dynamically online or edited in
its database files offline.
