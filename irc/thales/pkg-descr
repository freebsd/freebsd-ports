Thales is an IRC to MySQL Gateway.  It connects to your IRC network as a
service, and converts messages it receives to SQL queries to update the
database.  It collects data about users, channels and servers.  It does
not build stats itself, but gives you the database, it's your role to
write third-party applications or scripts, for example in PHP, to extract
data from it.  Some example applications are provided.

  later, 3.0.0 or later) is still included, but is not maintained
