rbot is a ruby IRC bot. Think of him as a ruby infobot, with more and different
features, and a nicer plugin scheme. His main features include:

    * Runtime configuration via irc chat
    * User authentication and access levels for using different bot features
    * Built in infobot-style keywords. See example session below.
    * Support for underlying fact database (infobot fact files), which can be
      overridden or supplemented by runtime keyword controls
    * Powerful plugin architecture, comes with plugins for many functions.
    * Multi-language support - comes with english definition only so far -
      translations welcome
