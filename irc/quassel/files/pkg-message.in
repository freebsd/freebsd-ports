To run quasselcore at system start-up, add quasselcore_enable="YES"
to /etc/rc.conf.

Quassel can use SSL connection between client and core parts. At first start
quasselcore will ask you to enter some information that will be incorporated
into generated SSL certificate. You can generate a new certificate by running
the following command as root:

# service quasselcore keygen
or
# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/quasselcore keygen

By default quasselcore listens on 4242 port at localhost.
To change default behavior set quasselcore_args variable in /etc/rc.conf.
See 'quasselcore --help' for available arguments.
