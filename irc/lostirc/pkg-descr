LostIRC is an IRC client for X, written in C++ using gtkmm as a widget set.
The goal of the first stable version, is to make a simple, keyboard
controlled IRC application with basic features implemented.

Key features:

   * Simple and minimal client, where the keyboard can be used almost
     exclusively
   * Tab-completion for both nicks and commands
   * Autojoin servers and set which IRC commands to execute on connect
   * Multi-server support
   * DCC SEND support
