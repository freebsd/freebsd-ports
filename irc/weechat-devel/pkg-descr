WeeChat (Wee Enhanced Environment for Chat) is a fast and light IRC 
client. Everything can be done with a keyboard, and it is customizable 
and extensible with scripts. For the moment, only ncurse GUI is
supported by this port.

Note: this is not the official release version, this is a git snapshot, which
may in some cases be unstable.
