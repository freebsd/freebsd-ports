Evangeline is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Bot based on Eggdrop.
Its done for IRCnet network and most changes are done to make the bot
best there. Bot might not work correctly on other networks (known problems
with kicking on Quakenet).
Evangeline can be simply extended with modules (Eggdrop's modules with
some modifications) and Tcl scripts of course.
