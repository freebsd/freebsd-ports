ircd-hybrid has now been installed.

*** IMPORTANT: ***
mkpasswd has been renamed to ircd-hybrid-mkpasswd to avoid conflicts with
other packages.

	mkpasswd -> ircd-hybrid-mkpasswd

Please read the INSTALL file for more information.

You should now copy
- %%PREFIX%%/etc/ircd-hybrid/reference.ircd.conf to
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf
- %%PREFIX%%/etc/ircd-hybrid/reference.modules.conf to
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/ircd-hybrid/modules.conf
and then edit to suit your needs. ircd-hybrid will not start without
%%PREFIX%%/etc/ircd-hybrid/ircd.conf

Don't forget to add

ircd_hybrid_enable="YES"

into your /etc/rc.conf.  You may then start the server by running:

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/ircd-hybrid start
EOM
}
