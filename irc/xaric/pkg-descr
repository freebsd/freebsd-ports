Xaric is a UNIX irc client similer to BitchX or ircII. I would impress you
with a list of features, but since it has no impressive features (and lacks
a few important ones) that probably is not a good
idea. The whole reason for Xaric was to remove all of the bogus, broken crap
and silly features from BitchX and have a nice colorful client.
