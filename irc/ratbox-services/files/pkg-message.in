ratbox-services has been successfully installed.

You should now copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/ratbox-services.conf.sample to
%%PREFIX%%/etc/ratbox-services.conf, and edit it as per the
ratbox-services documentation. This file is required to start services.

You may also need to perform the following steps, if you have not
already done so:

Initialize Database:
--------------------
This must be done before the services server can start, even if you are
converting from hybserv. Instructions for this are contained in:

	%%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.<database_backend>

The following directory has been created for the database to be stored
in. For consistency, please use this location when generating your
database instead of the directory specified in the help documentation:

	%%DBDIR%%

IRCD Server Config:
-------------------
On the ircd ratbox-services will connect to, add a connect{} block.
This should have services's server name (name in serverinfo{} in
ratbox-services.conf) and no autoconnect. 'send_password' and
'accept_password' should be equal and 'flags=encrypted' should
not be used.

If you use the ratbox-services compatibility code in ircd-ratbox,
all servers need service { name = "<ratbox-services's server name>"; };

Once you have added ratbox_services_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf, the
server can be started by running:

        %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/ratbox-services start

Important UPGRADE Note:
-----------------------
Upgrading from the 1.0.x series to this current release will likely
break everything. If upgrading between release versions you should
read the UPDATING information:

	%%DOCSDIR%%/UPDATING

Common database update tools and scripts referenced in ratbox-services
documentation can be found in:
	%%DOCSDIR%%/
