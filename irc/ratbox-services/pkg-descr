ratbox-services is a services package written mostly from scratch for
use with ircd-ratbox.

It is highly configurable, with nearly all options being set in a config
that can be rehashed rather than set at compile time. As well as supporting
standard database backends like PostgreSQL, its default is to use
the SQLite database backend, which works as a database interface to a normal
file, meaning no separate database software must be running.

Features:
	- User, nick and channel services
	- Jupe service
	- Global message service
	- Oper services
	- Watcher services
	- Opered bot
	- List service
	- Memo service
