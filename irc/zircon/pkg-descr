Zircon is an X11 interface to Internet Relay Chat.  The software
is written in tcl/tk and uses its native features to provide network
communications.  Suggestions for improvements to Zircon are welcome.
The author particularly interested in making the system useful for
those users in groups where JIPS and other national character sets
are used.

Zircon has more features than you could possibly imagine and
implements nearly everything that the irc II clients support as
well as many other useful and interesting features.  This reflects
the power of tcl/tk and not wonderful programming (the programming
is wonderful of course, but that is an aside).  The tcl/tk system
is excellent, and you need it on your machine NOW!
