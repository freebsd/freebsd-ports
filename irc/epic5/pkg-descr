EPIC4 is a new direction in ircII development. No longer is EPIC 100% 
backwards compatable with ircII, but instead those things where 
compatability is undesirable have been found and fixed. No gratuitous 
incompatabilities have been added, but lots of new code has been added to 
make EPIC the best ircII client available.

EPIC no longer shares any file names with ircII, so they should happily
co-exist.
