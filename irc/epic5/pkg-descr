EPIC5 is the 5th generation of the Enhanced Programmable ircII Client.
No longer is EPIC 100% backwards compatible with ircII, but instead those
things where compatibility is undesirable have been found and fixed.  No
gratuitous incompatibilities have been added, but lots of new code has been
added to make EPIC one of the best ircII clients available.

EPIC no longer shares any file names with ircII, so they should happily
co-exist.

Due to it's minimalist approach it is highly recommended you use a script
with EPIC.
