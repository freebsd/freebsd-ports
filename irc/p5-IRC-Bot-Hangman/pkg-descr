This module provides a useless IRC bot which enables you to play hangman,
the classic word game. It comes shipped with a list of ~2000 english words
by default. The architecture is plugin based, words, commands and
responses can be extended at will by adding new modules.

The main motivation was to provide a multi-player text based game for
children to help them practising writing.
