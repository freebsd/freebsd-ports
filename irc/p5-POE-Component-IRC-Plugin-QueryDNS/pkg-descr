POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::QueryDNS is a POE::Component::IRC plugin
that provides DNS query facilities to the channels it occupies and via
private messaging.

It uses POE::Component::Client::DNS to do non-blocking DNS queries. By
default the plugin attempts to use POE::Component::IRC's internal
PoCo-Client-DNS resolver object, but will spawn its own copy. You can
supply your own resolver object via the constructor.
