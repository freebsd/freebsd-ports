ccmix is a command-line tool to create and extract from archive files in
the Westwood Studios MIX format.  The tool can create any of the three main
variants used in classic Westwood games.  These are Tiberian Dawn versions,
Red Alert versions with both encrypted and unencrypted file headers, and
Tiberian Sun versions with encrypted and unencrypted file headers.  It also
optionally adds the XCC extension of including a local filenames database
to allow recovery of filenames from the one way hash they are stored as.
