Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data 
using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding 
and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best 
currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed 
with deflate but offers more dense compression.

The specification of the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined in RFC 7932.
