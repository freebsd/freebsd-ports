Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses
data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman
coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable
to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is
similar in speed with deflate but offers more dense compression.

This is the Brotli Extension for PHP
