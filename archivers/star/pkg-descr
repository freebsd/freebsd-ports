Star is the fastest known implementation of a tar archiver.

Main advantages over other tar implementations:
	fifo			- Keeps the tape streaming.
	pattern matcher		- For a convenient user interface.
	sophisticated diff	- User tailorable interface for comparing tar
				  archives against file trees.
	no namelen limitation	- Pathnames of arbitrary length may be archived.
	deals with all 3 times	- Stores/restores all 3 times of a file.
	does not clobber files	- More recent copies on disk will not be
				  clobbered from tape.
	automatic byte swap	- star automatically detects swapped archives.
	automatic format detect	- Automatically detects archive formats:
				  old tar, gnu tar, ansi tar, star.
        support for ACLS and	- star supports Access Control Lists as well as
	file flags		  extended file flags
	fully ansi compatible	- star is fully ANSI/Posix 1003.1 compatible.
	sophisticated error	- Allows to tell star which error types should be
	control			  ignored for which file name pattern
	true incremental	- star uses the same method as dump(8)/restore(8)
	dump/restore features	  but acts OS and FS independent
