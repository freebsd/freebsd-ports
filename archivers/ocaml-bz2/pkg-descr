CamlBZ2 provides OCaml bindings for libbz2 (AKA bzip2), a popular compression
library which typically compresses better (i.e., smaller resulting files) than
gzip.

Using CamlBZ2 you can read and write compressed "files", where files can be
anything offering an in_channel/out_channel abstraction (files, sockets, ...).

Also, with CamlBZ2 you can compress and decompress strings in memory using the
bzip2 compression algorithm.
