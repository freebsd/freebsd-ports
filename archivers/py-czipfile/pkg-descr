czipfile is a replacement for Python's builtin "zipfile" module, and
provides much faster, C-based zipfile decryption. The code is actually
95% identical to Python 2.6.5's Lib/zipfile.py, with some very minor
modifications to allow it to compile in Cython, and the _ZipDecrypter
class adapted to take advantage of native C datatypes.
