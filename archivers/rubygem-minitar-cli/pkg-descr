The minitar (previously called Archive::Tar::Minitar) library is a pure-Ruby
library that provides the ability to deal with POSIX tar(1) archive files.

This is release 0.6+, providing a number of bug fixes including a directory
traversal vulnerability, CVE-2016-10173. This release starts the migration and
modernization of the code:
- the minitar command-line program has been separated into the minitar-cli gem;
  and
- the archive-tar-minitar gem now points to the minitar and minitar-cli gems and
  discourages its installation.
