This package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing
streams of data represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the zlib C
library so it has high performance. It supports the "zlib",  "gzip" and
"raw" compression formats. It provides a convenient high level api suitable
for most tasks and for the few cases where more control is needed it provides
access to the full zlib feature set.
