Various command line tools for handling ZIM files (see devel/libzim).

Notable tools are:
- 'zimcheck' verifies that a given ZIM file is not corrupted. It provides many
  features to secure that ZIM entries are proper and properly linked.
- 'zimdump' inspects or dumps (part of) a ZIM file.
- 'zimsplit' splits smartly a ZIM file in smaller chunks.
- 'zimwriterfs' creates ZIM files from a locally-stored directory containing
  "self-sufficient" HTML content (with pictures, javascript and stylesheets).
  The result will contain all the files of the local directory compressed and
  merged in the ZIM file. The generated file can be opened with a ZIM reader;
  Kiwix is one example, but there are others.

A few other tools are provided as well.
