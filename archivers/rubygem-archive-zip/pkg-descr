The Archive::Zip library intends to provide a simple, yet complete and
Ruby-esque, interface to working with ZIP archives.

Basic archive creation and extraction can be handled using only a few methods.
More complex operations involving the manipulation of existing archives in place
(adding, removing, and modifying entries) are also possible with a little more
work.  Even adding advanced features such as new compression codecs are
supported with a moderate amount of effort.
