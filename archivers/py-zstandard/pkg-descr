This project provides Python bindings for interfacing with the Zstandard
compression library. A C extension and CFFI interface are provided.

Zstd, short for Zstandard, is a new lossless compression algorithm,
which provides both good compression ratio and speed for standard
compression needs. "Standard" translates into everyday situations
which neither look for highest possible ratio (which LZMA and ZPAQ
cover) nor extreme speeds (which LZ4 covers).

Please note that a simple python binding to Zstandard is also
available: archivers/py-zstd.
