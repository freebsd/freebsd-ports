This is the IO::Zlib module package for perl5.

This modules provides an IO:: style interface to the Compress::Zlib
package. The main advantage is that you can use an IO::Zlib object
in much the same way as an IO::File object so you can have common
code that doesn't know which sort of file it is using.
