plakar is a free and opensource utility to create distributed, versioned backups
with compression, encryption and data deduplication.

With a very clear goal to simplify backups, it is designed to be straightforward
to use.
It requires a few seconds to install and only a few minutes to get backups
set up and running: creating a backup is as simple as typing plakar backup
and restoring as simple as typing plakar restore.
