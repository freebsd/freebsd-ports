An installer created by the InstallShield software stores the files it will
install inside of InstallShield Cabinet Files. It would thus be desirable
to be able to extract the Microsoft Cabinet Files from the InstallShield
Cabinet Files in order to be able to install the applications without access
to Microsoft Windows.

- Use a well known open source license (MIT)
- Work on both little-endian and big-endian systems
- Separate the implementation in a tool and a library
- Support InstallShield versions 5 and later
- Be able to list contents of InstallShield Cabinet Files
- Be able to extract files from InstallShield Cabinet Files
