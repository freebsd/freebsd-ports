Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data. It has been
designed to transmit data to the processor cache faster than the traditional,
non-compressed, direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call.

Blosc works well for compressing numerical arrays that contains data with
relatively low entropy, like sparse data, time series, grids with regular-spaced
values, etc.

python-blosc a Python package that wraps Blosc.
