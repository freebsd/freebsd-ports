Arqiver is a simple Qt archive manager as a front-end for libarchive
(bsdtar), gzip, and 7z.

Arqiver can extract, create and edit archives that are supported by its
back-ends. It can open archives by drag-and-drop. Its listed items can be
viewed separately or dragged and dropped into appropriate applications.

With 7z, it also supports password protection.
