RVM is an archive manager that uses rsync to manage backups of multiple
clients across multiple logical partitions (vaults). It has some features
that some other rsync-based backup schemes lack, such as being written in
C++, needing no scripts or other programs than rsync and any binaries on
which rsync depends (such as SSH), the ability to manage multiple instances
of rsync connections to separate clients in parallel, the ability to use
multiple logical partitions (vaults) in a configurable fashion for purporses
of redundancy and added reliability, and the use of hard links for files that
have not changed from one archive to the next.
