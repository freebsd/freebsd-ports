Ark is a program for managing various archive formats within the KDE
environment.

Archives can be viewed, extracted, created and modified from within
Ark. The program can handle various formats such as tar, gzip, bzip2,
zip, rar and lha (if appropriate command-line programs are
installed). Ark can work closely with Konqueror and Dolphin in
a KDE Plasma environment to handle archives.
