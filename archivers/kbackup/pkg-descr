KBackup is a program that lets you back up any directories or files, whereby it
uses an easy to use directory tree to select the things to back up.

The program was designed to be very simple in its use so that it can be used by
non-computer experts.

The storage format is the well known TAR format, whereby the data is still 
stored in compressed format (bzip2 or gzip).

It also includes a German, French, Italian, Slovak and Russian translation for 
the user interface and an English, French and German handbook.
