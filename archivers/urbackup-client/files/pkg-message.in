archivers/urbackup-client includes an RC script:
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/urbackup_client

TO START URBACKUP CLIENT ON BOOT:
sysrc urbackup_client_enable=YES

START MANUALLY:
service urbackup_client start

The client daemon's configuration file is located at:
%%PREFIX%%/etc/urbackup/urbackupclient.conf

Log rotation can be configured at:
%%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/urbackupclient.conf

If the GTK2 GUI was built, it can be launched via:
%%PREFIX%%/bin/urbackupclientctl

NOTE: For client configuration or to view logs, the GTK2 GUI 
needs to have one of the following in its PATH:
	- kdesu (e.g., %%PREFIX%%/lib/kde4/libexec/)
		(port: x11/kde-runtime)
	- gksu (e.g., %%PREFIX%%/bin/)
		(port: sysutils/gksu)

The client can also be configured via the UrBackup Server, or
%%PREFIX%%/bin/urbackupclientctl
