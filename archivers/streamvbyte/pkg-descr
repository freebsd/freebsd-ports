StreamVByte is an integer compression technique that applies SIMD
instructions (vectorization) to Google's varint approach. The net
result is faster than other byte-oriented compression techniques.  The
approach is patent-free, the code is available under the Apache
License.  It includes fast differential coding.  It assumes a recent
Intel processor (e.g., haswell or better, though we provide runtime
dispatching for compatibility with legacy systems) or an ARM processor
with NEON instructions (which is almost all of them).
