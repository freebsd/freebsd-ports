StreamVByte is an integer compression technique that applies SIMD
instructions (vectorization) to Google's varint approach. The net result
is faster than other byte-oriented compression techniques.

The approach is patent-free, the code is available under the Apache License.

It includes fast differential coding.

It assumes a recent Intel processor (e.g., haswell or better, though we provide
runtime dispatching for compatibility with legacy systems) or an ARM processor
with NEON instructions (which is almost all of them).
