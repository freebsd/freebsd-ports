This is a reference C implementation of the LZFSE compressor introduced in the
Compression library with OS X 10.11 and iOS 9.

LZFSE is a Lempel-Ziv style data compression algorithm using Finite State
Entropy coding. It targets similar compression rates at higher compression and
decompression speed compared to deflate using zlib.
