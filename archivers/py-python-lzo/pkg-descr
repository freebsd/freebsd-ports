This module provides Python bindings for the LZO data compression library.

LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and very fast decompression. Decompression
requires no memory.

In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite competitive
compression ratio while still decompressing at this very high speed.
