LZ4 is a very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed
at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It also features an
extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically
reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.

A high compression derivative, called LZ4_HC, is also provided. It trades CPU
time for compression ratio.

The libraries are BSD licensed, and the binaries are GPLv2.
