In order to mount locally a remote archive or an entire repository as a FUSE
filesystem, it is required to load fusefs module, for instance, as root, run:

	kldload fusefs

To load the module at boot time, you can add it to the kld_list variable
in /etc/rc.conf or related files, for instance, by running

	sysrc kld_list+=fusefs

as root.  Alternatively, to load the module earlier, you can manually add

	fusefs_load="YES"

to /boot/loader.conf.local or /boot/loader.conf with a text editor.


Also, if you plan to mount borg repositories as non root user, you need to run

# sysctl vfs.usermount=1

and add the line

vfs.usermount=1

to /etc/sysctl.conf to ensure the setting is loaded at boot time.
