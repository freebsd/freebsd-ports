Lhasa is a command line tool and library for parsing LHA archives.

Currently it is only possible to decompress archives. Compressing
LHA archives may be an enhancement for future versions. The aim is
to be compatible with as many different variants of the LHA file
format as possible, including LArc (.lzs) and PMarc (.pma).

The command line tool aims to be interface-compatible with Unix LHA
tool (command line syntax and output), for backwards compatibility
with tools that expect particular output.
