Simple python bindings to Yann Collet's ZSTD compression library.

Zstd, short for Zstandard, is a new lossless compression algorithm,
which provides both good compression ratio and speed for standard
compression needs. "Standard" translates into everyday situations
which neither look for highest possible ratio (which LZMA and ZPAQ
cover) nor extreme speeds (which LZ4 covers).

Please note that this is a simple python binding to Zstandard.
A more full-featured binding is Gregory Szorc's py-zstandard
package.
