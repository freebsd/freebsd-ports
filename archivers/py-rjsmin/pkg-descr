rJSmin is a javascript minifier written in python. The minifier is based
on the semantics of jsmin.c by Douglas Crockford. The module is a 
re-implementation aiming for speed, so it can be used at runtime
(rather than during a preprocessing step). Usually it produces the same
results as the original jsmin.c.
