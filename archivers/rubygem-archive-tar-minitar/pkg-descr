Archive::Tar::Minitar is a pure-Ruby library and command-line utility that
provides the ability to deal with POSIX tar(1) archive files. The
implementation is based heavily on Mauricio Fernández's implementation
in rpa-base, but has been reorganised to promote reuse in other projects.

The library can only handle files and directories at this point.
The command line utility, minitar, can only create archives, extract from
archives, and list archive contents.
