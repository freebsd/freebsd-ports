9e is a program to explore Plan9 archives. You can do whatever you
like with the source so long as you clearly indicate all modifications
and the author responsible for each.

Usage Summary:

   $9e [options] <file> ...

Options:

    -h: dump headers only 
    -v: dump file names and sizes while extracting 
    -r: specify alternate root directory 
    -?: help 

If no file is named on the command line, standard input is assumed.
Note that the input file must be a decompressed archive (decompress
with gzip).
