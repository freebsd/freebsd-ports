LASzip is a compression library for compressing ASPRS LAS format data. It has
been provided as an LGPL-licensed stand-alone software library to allow other
softwares that handle LAS data to read and write LASzip-compressed data. The
BSD-licensed libLAS and the LGPL-licensed LASlib can take advantage of LASzip to
read and write compressed data.

LASzip is completely lossless. It compresses bulky LAS files into compact LAZ
files that are only 10-20 percent of the original size, accurately preserving
every single bit.
