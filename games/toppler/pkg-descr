The target of the game is to reach the target door of each of the 8
towers in currently 2 missions with this little green animal. This
door is usually at the very top of the tower.

But finding the way by using elevators and walking trough a maze of
doors and platforms is not the only problem you have to solve. There
is a bunch of other creatures living on the tower that will hinder
you to reach your target by pushing you over the edge of the
platforms.

The only weapon of defence you have is to throw a little snowball. But
most of the other creatures just don't care about this. So you must
avoid them.
