QStat is a command-line program that displays real-time information about
Internet game servers.  The servers can be either down, non-responding, or
running a game.  For servers running a game, the server name, map name,
current number of players, and response time are displayed.  Server rules
and player information may also be displayed.  It can output templates for
automatic HTML generation, and also has raw display mode for integration
with custom server browsers.
