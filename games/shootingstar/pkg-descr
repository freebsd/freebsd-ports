The Red-Shirted-Guy served happily in the police forces for many
years, until he got kicked out because he used too much violence.
He started drinking. After couple months his twin brother, the
Green-Shirted-Guy, thought that Red's life wasn't very glamourous,
so Green asked Red if he wanted to collaborate and start killing
bad guys. They both thought it was a good idea and so they started
their agency, The Shooting Stars. It was finally the time to take
law to their own hands.
