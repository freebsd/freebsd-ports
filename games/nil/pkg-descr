NiL is a remake of a little-known title called Liero, a freeware game that runs
on DOS. The creator, designer, and all-round good guy behind NiL, Flemming
Fransden, had stumbled across Liero at a demo-party in the former East Germany.
When the author of Liero was apparently uninterested in making the source code
available or porting it to other platforms, Flemming set about reimplementing
Liero from the ground up -- under the catchy name NiL. 

NiL takes place far underground where players are personified as cute little
blue worms. But, don't let the game's seemingly innocent appearance fool you.
Using worms armed to the teeth with weaponry normally reserved for first-person
shooters, NiL combines the best features of the Quake series of online gaming
with the comical traits of Worms. Together, this allows for a lively and
dynamic environment where you can tunnel and blast your way around the screen,
creating your own escape routes from the surrounding mayhem. NiL also sports
the right price -- free.
