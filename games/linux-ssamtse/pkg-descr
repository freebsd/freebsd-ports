Serious Sam: Second Encounter introduces three worlds where cyberpunk
once again meets fantasy fiction, and features frantic action in
12 massive single player levels. The Second Encounter includes three
new episodes based in beautifully detailed ancient civilizations: South America,
Babylon, and The Medieval Age. With fourteen total weapons at his disposal,
three brand new, Sam is more serious than ever. He battles against hordes of
old enemies and seven adversarial species in an effort to reach the Mental
once and for all.

Having successfully defeated the Mental forces in ancient Egypt,
Sam "Serious" Stone seizes an abandoned spacecraft. On course in his crusade
to finally assassinate the great evil Mental, our hero's spaceship suddenly
tumbles into the South American Mountains - Sam seems destined to stay on Earth.
He must fight the tougher, now more experienced members of Mental's destructive
forces and find a new way to reach the notorious Mental himself.
