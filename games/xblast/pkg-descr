XBlast is a multi-player arcade game for X11. The game
can be played with at least two players and up to six
players. It was inspired by the video/computer game
Bomberman(Dynablaster), which was to my knowledge first
programmed for NEC's PC Engine/Turbo Grafx. Other (com-
mercial) versions of the original game exist for IBM-PC,
Atari ST, Amiga, NES, GameBoy and Super NES.
