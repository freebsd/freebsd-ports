These tablebases do not include the pawn tablebases, which are quite
large.  This port alone will eat up around 2G. The pawn ending
tablebases will need to be installed with the
games/crafty-tablebase-pawn port, if you really want them.

Be warned that both ports together will eat up around 7.1 Gigs of your
disk space, or 14.2G if you don't delete the distfiles. (I highly
recommend doing this, as these files almost never change).

SERIOUSLY CONSIDER doing 'rm ${DISTFILES}/crafty/*.emd' as root when
you have installed all of the tablebases you're going to want.

To make use of the tablebases, something like the following should be
added to your ~/.craftyrc file:

	egtb
	cache 12M
