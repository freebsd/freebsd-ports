Shotgun Debugger is a 2D, top-down action game. It is The Future, and your
habit of computer network exploration has finally done you in. You are
captured and taken to a strange underground complex populated by robot
soldiers. Your task is to escape the facility--but the hordes of walking
death machines aren't just gonna let you.

Shotgun Debugger is pseudo-3D -- while gameplay is strictly two-dimensional,
the world is rendered in three dimensions. Worlds are not tile-based, but
polygon-based -- rooms and hallways can be made to any shape imaginable,
allowing for some rather impressive architecture.
