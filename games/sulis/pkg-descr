Sulis is a Role Playing Game (RPG) with turn based, tactical combat, deep
character customization and an engaging storyline. The game has been built from
the ground up with modding and custom content in mind.

The game is currently fully playable and includes the complete three acts of The
Twin Expanse, an old school RPG campaign in the vein of classic games such as
Baldur's Gate, but mixing in modern elements from titles like Divinity: Original
Sin and Pillars of Eternity. There is additionally The Endless Dungeon, a pure
action dungeon crawl with more Roguelike elements.

The core game engine as well as the campaign are now considered largely
complete, although there is always room for improvement. Users are encouraged to
file issues with bugs, feature requests, or any other feedback.

Features:
- Multiple campaigns with many hours of playtime, featuring both handcrafted and
  procedural content.
- We are designing a detailed and fully realized world and story - check out the
  Lore page.
- Highly extensible and designed from the ground up for modding support.
- A powerful 2D graphics engine with zoom, scalable UI, HiDPI support, and a
  swappable graphics backend.
- Runs on very modest hardware - even software renderers (although at a reduced
  frame rate).
