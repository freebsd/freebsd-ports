A turn-based strategy game where up to 8 players strive for control
of as many cities as possible. Produce new armies in cities to
conquer nearby cities. Using the income from those cities, make
more armies to take more cities. Send a hero to a temple to get a
quest, or maybe search a nearby ruin instead. Play with others or
against the computer.
