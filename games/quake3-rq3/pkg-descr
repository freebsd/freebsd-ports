Reaction Quake 3 is a total conversion mod for Quake III Arena based on action
and realism with a specific emphasis on action over realism. Reaction is a
port of the classic Action Quake 2 (AQ2) mod. AQ2 still enjoys great
popularity in online gaming even 4 years after it was initially released and
on an "obsolete" game engine as well. Many people attribute this lasting
popularity to both the unique gameplay and the AQ2 community.

AQ2 is still more popular than any other Q3 realism mod and any other Quake 2
and Quake/QuakeWorld mods.  Reaction Quake 3 aims to bring the gameplay of AQ2
to a new, more modern game engine. This mod is made by AQ2 fans and players
specifically for those who love the fast and furious AQ2 gameplay and also to
hopefully expose a new generation of players to this unique gameplay.
