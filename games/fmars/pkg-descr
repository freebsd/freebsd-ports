fmars is Fast Memory Array Redcode Simulator

A specialized simulator for the game of Corewars. It's designed to be of
particular use in automated redcode optimizers and evolvers. fmars borrows the
idea from Martin Ankerl's qmars and pushes it to the extreme.

It generates source code with special case for every possible opcode/addressing
mode combination. This allows some optimizations that aren't possible in other
simulators.

fmars is compatible with pMARS with an exception for p-space, which is not yet
implemented.
