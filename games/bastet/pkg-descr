Have you ever thought Tetris(R) was evil because it wouldn't send you
that straight "I" brick you needed in order to clear four rows at the
same time?

Well Tetris(R) probably isn't evil, but Bastet certainly is. Bastet
stands for "bastard tetris", and is a simple ncurses-based Tetris(R)
clone for Linux. Unlike normal Tetris(R), however, Bastet does not
choose your next brick at random. Instead, Bastet uses a special
algorithm designed to choose the worst brick possible.

As you can imagine, playing Bastet can be a very frustrating experience!
