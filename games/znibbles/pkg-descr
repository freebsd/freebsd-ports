ZNibbles is a multi-player networked game. It is based on the old nibbles
game: you've got a worm, eat nibbles and get your worm growing. Several
players can play together, each of them controlling its own worm on its own
computer.

There is theoretically an unlimited number of simultaneous players, it's more
a matter of network speed. It has been tested with more than 10 players and it
was real fun :) ZNibbles is written for unix. It has been tested under Linux,
SunOS, Solaris and Irix. The game can run either directly on top of X11, use
the GTK+ toolkit (get it on the GTK+ site) or use the Motif toolkit (get a good
Motif free implementation called LessTif) 

Once compiled, you get the files:

   nibbles   : the ZNibbles server
   gznibbles : the ZNibbles GTK+ client
   znibblesX : the ZNibbless X11-only client (poor)

Run "nibbles" first as the ZNibbles server, and then run its clients to play.
