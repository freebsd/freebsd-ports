ZNibbles is a multi-player networked game. It is based on the old
nibbles game: you've got a worm, eat nibbles and get your worm growing.
Several players can play together, each of them controlling its own worm
on its own computer.

There is theoretically an unlimited number of simultaneous players, it's
more a matter of network speed. It has been tested with more than 10
players and it was real fun :) ZNibbles is written for Unix. It has been
tested under Linux, SunOS, Solaris and Irix. The game can run either
directly on top of X11, use the GTK+ toolkit (get it on the GTK+ site)
or use the Motif toolkit (get a good Motif free implementation called
LessTif) 

Once compiled, you get the files:

   nibbles   : the ZNibbles server
   gznibbles : the ZNibbles GTK+ client
   znibblesX : the ZNibbless X11-only client (poor)

Run "nibbles" first as the ZNibbles server, and then run its clients to
play.
