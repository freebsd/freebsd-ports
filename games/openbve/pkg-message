To play, you need to add at least one route and a train to OpenBVE after
installation.  The Uchibo line, a classical line in the BVE world which
comes with the original BVE software, can be downloaded from here:

	http://bvets.net/old/archives/uchibo10.zip

Unzip the file, install it with "wine msiexec /i uchibo10.msi", and move
the `Railway' and `Train' directories to ~/.config/openBVE/LegacyContent.
