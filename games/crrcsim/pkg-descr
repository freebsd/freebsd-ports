Crrcsim is a model-airplane flight simulation program. Using it,
you can learn how to fly model aircraft, test new aircraft designs,
and improve your skills by practicing on your computer.

It rules! The flight model is very realistic. The flight model
parameters are calculated based on a 3D representation of the
aircraft. Stalls are properly modelled as well. Model control is
possible with your own rc transmitter, or any input device such as
joystick, mouse, keyboard.
