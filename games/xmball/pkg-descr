Masterball is a puzzle similar in nature to the famous Rubik's Cube.
The original puzzle has 8 sectors on a sphere  (longitudinal cuts),
with each sector divided into 4 segments (latitudinal cuts).

By building from the source and editing its Imakefile before the
``build'' phase, you may be able to use Motif or LessTif with this port.
