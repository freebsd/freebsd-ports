The Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) is a Java library that enables
cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development
of graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan), audio (OpenAL) and parallel computing
(OpenCL) applications. This access is direct and high-performance, yet
also wrapped in a type-safe and user-friendly layer, appropriate for the
Java ecosystem.
LWJGL is an enabling technology and provides low-level access. It is not
a framework and does not provide higher-level utilities than what the
native libraries expose. As such, novice programmers are encouraged to
try one of the frameworks or game engines that make use of LWJGL, before
working directly with the library.
LWJGL is open source software and freely available at no charge.
