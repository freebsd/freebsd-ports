ColorCode is a free advanced MasterMind clone with lots of different
game variants, from the very easy up to really challenging ones.
You can combine any color count from 2-10 with any column count
from 2-5 and allow or not pegs of the same color. Or you may select
one of the 5 predefined levels of difficulty. ColorCode has also a
rather intelligent built-in MasterMind solver.
