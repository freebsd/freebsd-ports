Should the game freeze when entering a match, try to change the value of
com_zoneMegs (e.g. to 48).

The configuration files are saved to ~/.ioquake3 instead of ~/.q3a because
they have additional variables which would be removed if other engines
overwrite them. But you can safely copy the original directory to the new one
for the first time.
