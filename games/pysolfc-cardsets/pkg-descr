This is collection of free cardsets adapted for use with PySolFC,
including large cards for high resolution displays (or for the
vision impaired).

It is provided as a separate package to keep the main distribution
reasonably small.

The "bknoll" cardsets were adapted from Byron Knoll's public-domain
card images.  The large and huge sets are large enough to be used
on most hi-res displays without enabling scaling in PySolFC.
