Q2PRO is a Quake2 engine modification. Client and server sides are both
compatible with original Quake2 v3.20 network architecture, as well as with
modern R1Q2 network architecture. Q2PRO is designed to be secure, fast and
doesn't provide any graphical enhancements that are contrary to the classic
Quake2 look and feel. It provides some features yet unique to Quake2, notably
server side Multi View Demos. Q2PRO has it's own software and OpenGL refresh
libraries and runs under Win32 and GNU/Linux natively.

Q2PRO supports the following network protocols:
- 34, original Quake2 protocol.
- 35, enhanced R1Q2 protocol.
- 36, enhanced Q2PRO protocol, extension of R1Q2 protocol.
- 37, special broadband MVD protocol.
