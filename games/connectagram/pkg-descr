Connectagram is a word unscrambling game. The board consists of several
scrambled words that are joined together. You can choose the length of
the words, the amount of words, and the pattern that the words are
arranged in.

The game provides a hint option for times when you are stuck, and
features an online word lookup that fetches the definitions of each word
from www.wiktionary.org. Your current progress is automatically saved.

Note that this game involves a large and varied word list, some of which
may be considered inappropriate for children. You can edit the file
containing the word list if you wish to remove words from your game. The
location of this file varies by platform.
