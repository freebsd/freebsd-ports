The Ur-Quan Masters is a port of the original Star Control 2 for 3DO Consoles.

The game features space exploration, diplomacy and combat as well as resource
gathering and building. The player can freely explore hundreds of star systems,
planets and moons. To defeat the evil Ur-Quan that have enslaved earth, he will
need to gather knowledge and materials, and build alliances with alien races.

The project started in August 2002, when Toys For Bob released the partially
ported sources of the Star Control 2 3DO version to the fan community. That
community has since updated and extended the code to run on modern computers.
