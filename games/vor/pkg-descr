Variations on Rockdodger (VoR) is a fork of Paul Holt's little gem Rock
Dodger, which has now accumulated enough differences to be worth releasing
on its own.  The premise is simple: dodge the rocks until you die. No
shields, no weapons, no bonus lives, just pure rockdodgin' fun for your
spare moments. VoR has ray-traced rocks, a free-scrolling screen, and
"real" physics for your ship.  Warning: this game is, if anything, harder
than the original. It is intended to be a quickie game to kill a few spare
moments here and there, not an epic space adventure.
