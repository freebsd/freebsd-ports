Bos Wars is a futuristic real time strategy game (RTS). In a RTS game, the
player has to combat his enemies while developing his war economy. Everything
runs in real-time, as opposed to turn-based games where the player always
has to wait for his turn. The trick is to balance the effort put into
building his economy and building an army to defend and attack the enemies.

Bos Wars has a dynamic rate based economy. Energy is produced by power
plants and magma gets pumped from hot spots. Buildings and mobile units
are also built at a continuous rate. Control of larger parts of the map
creates the potential to increase your economy throughput. Holding key
points like roads and passages allow for different strategies.

It is possible to play against human opponents over LAN, internet, or
against the computer. Bos Wars successfully runs under Linux, MS Windows,
BSD, and Mac OS X.
