The game follows Naija, a mermaid-like woman, as she explores the
underwater world of Aquaria. Along her journey, she learns about both
the history of the world and her own past. The gameplay focuses on a
combination of swimming, singing and combat, through which Naija can
interact with the world. Naija's songs can move items, affect plants
and animals, and change her physical appearance into other
forms. These forms have different abilities, such as firing
projectiles at hostile creatures or passing through barriers
inaccessible to her in her natural form. -- Wikipedia
