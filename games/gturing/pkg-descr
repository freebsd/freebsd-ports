gturing is a simple turing machine simulator with 
graphical interface. A Turing machine is the simplest possible 
computing device which can only perform very simple operations.
However, almost everything in programming languages can be
written as a program for the Turing machine.

Of course, no one uses the Turing machine for actual computing 
work, but it is very useful in theoretical computer science and
mathematical logic.

It's a nice complement for students who likes to practice with
theory and a nice toy to play with.
