Domino-Chain is a puzzle game where you have to rearrange dominoes
on different platforms to start a chain reaction that makes all
dominoes topple over. There are many strange types of dominoes,
such as the Ascender which will rise to the ceiling when pushed,
or the Exploder which will blast a hole into the platform it stands
on.

Domino-Chain is a faithful reincarnation of the game Pushover
originally published by Ocean in 1992. Compared to Pushover,
Domino-Chain has some new levels, some additional domino types,
better graphics in higher resolution and high-quality music. On top
of that, you can load and play the original levels from Pushover
if you have a copy of it.
