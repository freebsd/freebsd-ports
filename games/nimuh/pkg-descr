Nimuh is a project puzzle game destined to improve the knowledge
of Andalusia

We are CaninoStudios, a development group destined to make video
games under the free software philosophy. We are writing you to
make a presentation of our latest release "Nimuh, searching for the
Andalusian treasure".

This project is oriented to education and acknowledge of our land,
Andalusia.

"Nimuh" has been released under the Creative Commons license. It's
a puzzle type game and it's based in the "Theseus and the Minotaur
Mazes" game, but we decided to improve it by adding a 3D isometric
view. You can go through 40 different Andalusian locations and play
all the levels while you learn about the typical food, fiestas and
history of every place.
