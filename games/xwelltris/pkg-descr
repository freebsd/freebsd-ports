XWelltris is a tetris like popular game.

  Imaging that you are looking into the glass from the top. You see four
walls and the bottom. The flat 2d figures falling down from the walls one
by one. You can move these figures from one wall to another or rotate them.
If the figure leave the wall then it moves on the bottom while another
figure is pushed. You need to form full rows and/or columns on the bottom.
When you form such row, it disappear and you receive additional empty space
on the bottom and scores :). The more rows disappear at a time, the more
scores you have. If you can't place the whole figure on the bottom, then it
stays on the wall and this wall became frozen (you can't place figures on
it) for a while. After nth rows were successfully cleared, you will receive
bonus figure and go to to the next level - game speed will be increased.
Your task is to play more longer and earn more scores.
