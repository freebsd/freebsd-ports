Auralquiz is a simple music quiz game for GNU/Linux, using your own
music files.

The game plays short pieces of music files from your folders (in
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Opus or MP3 formats), and presents a question and
several answers about the current song. The fastest the answer, the
more points you receive.

Up to 8 people can play in a turn-based mode.

In the highest difficulty level there are no answer buttons, and
instead, you have to type the answer yourself.
