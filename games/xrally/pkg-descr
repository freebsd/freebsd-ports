XRally is a Linux clone of the classic Rally X arcade game. For
those who don't know, in Rally X you control a blue (good) car,
that has to collect yellow flags around a maze-like map, while
avoiding the red (bad) cars. In order to help himself, the blue car
can use clouds of smoke through the maze. If a enemy touch any of
these clouds, it stops for a while. The enemy cars can also crash
one with the other, what gives you some extra time.

XRally is written in C using only the basic Xlib and Xpm libraries.
It's a project aimed mainly at newbie X11/Game programmers like me
(but any experienced help is appreciated! :) )
