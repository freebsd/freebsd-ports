noeGNUd is an alternate ascii/2D/3D User-Interface for the roguelike
RPG "Nethack" and its Variants. Its difference to many other Interfaces
lies in the utilisation of OpenGL to display the whole game. You can
rotate the scenery as much as you like. It provides dynamic lightning
and an outstanding 3D-Mode.

This port installs noeGNUd for the SLASH'EM variant of Nethack.
