Linley's Dungeon Crawl is a free and portable roguelike molded in the tradition
of the early greats of the genre: Rogue, Hack, and Moria. 
The player guides a single character deep into a subterranean complex
to retrieve the Orb of Zot, fending off many horrible and hideous creatures
along the way. Once retrieved, the player must return both character and Orb
safely to the surface world. Easier said than done, but fun all the same.
