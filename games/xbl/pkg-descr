                                 XBL 1.0                                  

XBL is a 3D block-dropping game.
XBL is an interactive game under X11 (color or black&white) and UN*X.
XBL is a good training tool to understand 3D rotations and 3D vision.
    You need reflex and memory (human).
XBL implements 6 different ways to perform animation under X11!
 
- The game world is a 3D discrete space.
- The player has a top view of this discrete space.
- The game throws blocks made of cubes (one to five cubes).
- A block falls inside the discrete space, and stops when hitting the 
  floor or another block.
- If a discrete space level is full, it is destroyed.
- Another block appears (only one moving block at a time).
- Player can move or rotate blocks (perfect real time if you have a fast host).
The goal is to play as long as possible.
