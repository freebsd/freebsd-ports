Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks is a puzzle/blockfall game inspired
by Nintendo's Tetris Attack (or "Panel de Pon") for the Super
Nintendo. It might seem like any other match-3 style game but it is
generally much faster. The game requires fast decisions compared to
other puzzle games. While you can setup the perfect chain it is much
more likely that you will construct chains while blocks are still
dropping around you.

In addition to traditional game types like endless, time trial and
stage clear the game does also feature a VS-mode. The VS mode is a
dual like you rarely see in a puzzle game.

Features:
- No loot boxes
- 5 single player modes: Endless, Time Trial, Puzzle Mode, Stage Clear
  and Vs. Mode
- 2 two player options: Time Trial and Vs. Mode
- Puzzle mode with 27 puzzles
- Custom keymapping
