XVmines is a simple minesweeper game for X Window System.

xvmines creates a rectangle on the screen, divided into equally sized
cells. Each cell may contain a mine (hence the name xvmines), contain a
number indicating the number of mines present in the 8-neighboring cells
or be empty.

Initially, all cells are covered with tiles. A tile can be removed,
uncovering the cell below, by clicking the left mouse button on it. In
addition, a cell can be marked as containing a mine by clicking the
right mouse button on it. Note however that marking a cell as containing
a mine does not necessarily mean that the cell really contains a mine!

Clicking the middle mouse button on a tile, marks it with a question
mark, acting as a reminder mechanism. The user can use the numbers in
the uncovered cells to find (or sometimes guess ...) which cells contain
mines and which do not.

A game ends when all cells not containing mines have been uncovered and
all cells containing mines have been marked, or when a cell containing a
mine is uncovered.
