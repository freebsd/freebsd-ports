Xjewel is a dropping block game akin to tetris.

It is played by controlling the motion of blocks which continue to fall from
the top of the screen.  One can move them left and right, as well as
rotate the jewel segments.  The object is to get the most points before
the grim reaper ends the fun.

Death happens when the screen is no longer capable of holding any more
blocks.  To make high scores more interesting, you are given but three
attempts to get points -- use them wisely.

As the game progresses, and more jewels are removed, the speed of the game
will increase.  This is measured in seconds of delay between steps of
block motion.
