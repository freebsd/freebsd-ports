Yamagi Quake II is an enhanced client for id Software's Quake II with
focus on offline and cooperative gameplay.  Both the gameplay and the
graphics are unchanged, but many bugs in the last official release were
fixed and some nice to have features like widescreen support and a modern
OpenGL 3.2 renderer were added.  Unlike most other Quake II source ports
Yamagi Quake II is fully 64-bit clean.  It works perfectly on modern
processors and operating systems.
