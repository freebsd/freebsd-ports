GtkTetcolor is a game that resembles well-known tetris and columns. The rules
of the game are simple - you can move or rotate the block which continue to
fall. After block landing the sequence of at least three cells horizontally,
vertically or diagonally having matching colors is removed and the above blocks
will collapse. If two or more sequences will be removed simultaneously the
player has got bonus points. The game will be over when new block cannot be
placed on screen.
