You installed RetroArch: libretro-based entertainment platform.

RetroArch is the lowest tier of the entertainment platform. The middle
tier is the core, which is usually an interpreter of the computer game
code. The top tier is the game code itself.

You can run the stack with this command:
$ retroarch -L some-core-libretro.so some-game.game

Enjoy!
