RetroArch supports multiple backends for input devices like gamepads:

- Kernel driver (iichid): The functionality previously provided
  by the sysutils/iichid port is now integrated into the FreeBSD
  base system. For more details, consult the iichid(4) man page.
  Users may need to adjust access permissions on the appropriate
  /dev/input/eventN device for their user account to use gamepads.
- SDL2, which uses userspace raw USB HID access
  (you have to grant access permissions on the appropriate
   /dev/uhidN device to your user account)
