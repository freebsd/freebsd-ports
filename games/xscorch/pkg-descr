XScorch is a clone of the olden-days DOS game "Scorch".
It is an extremely addictive war game where any mixture of
humans and computer AIs control separate tanks (teams are
possible) and attempt to blow up or arrange to blow up the
other tanks on the field (which can vary from rugged,
mountainous terrain to flat plains).  The last tank on the
field is the winner.
