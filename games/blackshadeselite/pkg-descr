Black Shades Elite is an action game that is more or less similar
to the original Black Shades "Psychic Bodyguard FPS". Kill anyone
that tries to kill the VIP (the white guy). The psychic part is
seeing blue lines when bad guys line up on the VIP (when the line
is red they are about to shoot). Other powers (slow down, and
visions) are available - press F1 for how to use.

It has a few more user friendly options (in the ~/blackshades.config
file) as well as a help menu. Aside from that the internals have
had some major changes, but there is still a lot more to do. Other
options include 3rd person (which was in the original game, just
disabled). The other change that I enjoy is the lack of a busy loop
- now cpu usage isn't 100% - on any recent system it should be less
than 25%.

Feature and bug reports are encouraged. I'm sure it's buggy. Enjoy.
