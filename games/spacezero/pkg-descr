SpaceZero is a Real Time Strategy 2D space combat game for two
players over a network.

The objective is to conquer the universe, defeating all enemies.

At starting point you have only one ship and one planet, but you
have gold to buy more ships to conquer more planets.

All ships can be controlled by the computer (automatic mode) or by
the player (manual mode). You can easily change among your ships,
controlling all of them independently.
