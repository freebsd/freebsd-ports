The computer calculates a combination of five characters (each between
A and J) and you have to try to find out the combination the computer
has calculated. Your questions to the computer are also combinations of
five characters (each between A and J).

You get sets of black and/or white blocks as answers to your questions.

If you get a black block as answer it means that there is one character
in your try at the correct position (but you don't know which one it
is).

If you get a white block as answer it means that there is a character in
your guess that also occurs in the solution, but at another position
(but you don't know which one it is and at which position it would be
correct).
