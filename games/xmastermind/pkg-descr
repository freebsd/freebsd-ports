The computer calculates a combination of five characters (each between
A and J) and you have to try to find out  the combination the computer
has calculated.  Your questions to  the computer are also combinations
of five characters (each between A and J).

You   get sets  of black  and/or   white  blocks as   answers  to your
questions.

If  you  get a  black block  as  answer it  means  that  there  is one
character  in your  try at  the correct position  (but  you don't know
which one it is).

If you get a white block as answer it means that  there is a character
in  your  guess that also   occurs  in the  solution,  but at  another
position (but you don't know which one it  is and at which position it
would be correct).
