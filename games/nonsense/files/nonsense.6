.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Nonsense
generates random
.Pq and sometime humorous
text from datafiles and templates using a very simple, recursive grammar.
It's like having a million monkeys sitting in front of a million
typewriters, without having to feed or clean up after them.
From fake Slashdot headlines to absurd
college courses to buzzword bingo cards,
.Nm
is a good way to waste time.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b Ar bullet
Specify a
.Dq bullet
go in front of each item.
.It Fl d
Debug mode
.Pq shows each substitution
.It Fl D
Verbose debug mode
.Pq shows each substitution and the result
.It Fl e
Disable direct eval()'s
.It Fl f Ar data_file
Specify a data file to load in.
Use multiple
.Fl f
options to include additional files.
The
.Pa default.data
file is always loaded.
.It Fl F
Load all
.Pa *.data
files.
.It Fl n Ar number
Repeat
.Ar n
times.
.It Fl t Ar template_file
Use a template file.
The markup in this file will be processed and the result output to
.Dv stdout.
.It Fl p
Separate each item with a blank line.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl d
and
.Fl D
options are mutually exclusive.
.Pp
Thanks to contributions by
.An Fred Hirsch Aq truehand@darkhart.com ,
.Nm
can also be executed as a CGI script.
Details are in
.Pa %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/nonsense/README .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa %%PREFIX%%/share/nonsense/data/*
.Nm
data files.
Any files specified with the
.Fl f
option are found by looking in the current directory and then this
directory.
The
.Fl F
option loads all files in this directory.
.It Pa %%PREFIX%%/share/nonsense/template/*
.Nm
template files.
Any file specified with the
.Fl t
option is found by looking in the current directory and then this
directory.
.El

.Xr fortune 6 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Ed
.Sh FILE FORMATS
.Nm Nonsense
reads in
.Dq template files
and
.Dq data files .
.Pp
A template file is merely a text file containing
.Dq tags
enclosed in curly braces
.Po
.Sq {
and
.Sq }
.Pc .
.Nm Nonsense
substitutes random text for these
tags using a really crude markup language.
.Pp
A data file is a text file divided into sections
.Pq seperated by a blank line ,
each one containing a list of text items
.Pq seperated by a newline
that are randomly selected to fill in the template.
.Pp
There are a few special cases that allow
.Nm
to handle more elaborate situations:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It {#number1-number2}
This tag will be replaced with a random number between
.Ar number1
and
.Ar number2
.Pq inclusive .
.It {[item1|item2|item3...}
This tag will be replaced with one item from the list.
If only one item is listed then it will be output %50 of the time
.Pq and nothing output the other 50% .
.It {@strftime format}
This tag will be replaced with the current date/time using the
.Xr strftime 3
format string.
So, for instance,
{@A}
would be replaced with the current day of the week.
.It {@strftime format|number1|number2}
Same as above, but uses the date/time that occured X seconds ago,
where X is a random number between
.Ar number1
and
.Ar number2 .
For instance,
{@%H:%M|0|86400}
would be replaced by the hour:minute anywhere from 0 to 86400 seconds
.Pq 1 day
ago.
.It {;short perl code segment}
The perl code within the braces will be evaluated.
This is useful for doing something really
complicated that requires the full power of Perl.
However, this is risky since there's no error checking and no
.Dq sandbox .
You can disable this behavior with the
.Fl e
option.
.It {\echaracter}
This allows literal characters that couldn't otherwise be specified,
such as:
.Bl -tag -width "{\e###}" -compact -offset indent
.It {\en}
newline
.It {\e0}
null
.Pq i.e. nothing
.It {\eL}
Left brace
.Pq Sq {
.It {\eR}
Right brace
.Pq Sq }
.It {\e###}
.Xr ascii 7
character in decimal
.El
.It {variablename=literal text}
Stores the text on the right-hand side of the equals sign to
the specified state variable, without outputting anything.
This is useful for preserving context and is
used, for example, in the Slashdot simulator.
.It {variablename:=command}
Similar to above, but evaluates the command
and stores the result into a state variable.
.It {$variablename}
Returns the contents of a state variable.
.It {command#number1-number2}
Evaluates the command a random number of times between
.Ar number1
and
.Ar number2 .
.El
.Pp
Case is important!
{ProductName}, {productname} and {PRODUCTNAME} are slightly different.
If the name is given in lowercase, the
substitution will be converted to all lowercase
.Pq i.e. fed through the perl lc function .
.Pp
Upercase names specify the opposite; the result is uppercoased with uc.
Mixed case names tell
.Nm
to leave the case of the result alone
.Pq this is usually what is used .
Finally, if you prepend a name with a caret,
.Sq ^
.Pq i.e. {^ProductName} ,
the result is fed through the perl ucfirst function, which will
capitalize the first character only.
