Wargus is a Warcraft 2 mod that allows you to play Warcraft 2 with the
Stratagus engine, as opposed to playing it with the original Warcraft 2
one.

You will need a legal copy of Warcraft 2 (original DOS version required,
won't work with the Battle.net Edition) since Wargus doesn't come with
any graphics or sounds itself.

Since Wargus uses a different engine, not all things will work the same
as they did in the original game. If you want an absolutely unchanged
Warcraft 2 experience, you will still have to play the original.
