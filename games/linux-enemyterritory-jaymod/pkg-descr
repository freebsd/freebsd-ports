Jaymod is an add-on modification to RTCW: Enemy Territory.

The idea for Jaymod came from the main features of Shrubmod. Shrubmod has
long been out of date and unsupported, and with the instability issues that
come with Shrubmod, something had to be done to get a Shrub-like server-side
mod that would provide most of Shrub's features, be stable, and be supported.

This mod has, obviously, outgrown the original objective of being server-side
only. Some of the ideas I wanted to implement could not be done with server
code only, so the decision was made to start working on the client end as
well. I wanted this to be as easy as possible for end users, and now only one
pak needs to be downloaded (on the fly) to be able to play this mod.
