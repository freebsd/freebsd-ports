Divide and succeed is a slicing cake game :-D

You have to cut a Polygon in a specific number of equal parts using
a specific number of lines.

Levels consists of a list of Polygons, a number of parts and a
number of slices. Maximum width allowed for a level is 600, Maximum
height is 400. There is no level editor at the moment, so it's
text-editor style.
