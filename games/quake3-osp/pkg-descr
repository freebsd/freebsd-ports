OSP Tourney DM is designed to facilitate competitive, yet flexible, match
play.  This mod simply makes it easier and more convenient for players and
and admins alike to enhance the Quake 3 experience.  There have absolutely
been *NO* changes to the core gameplay or its dynamics -- its all default
Quake 3 in this regard.
