Bombermaze is Bomberman clone for GNOME. It is a multiplayer action game in
which players run around in a square-grid maze while dropping bombs and
collecting power-ups. The bombs exlode after a short time delay, taking out any
nearby bricks and players. For maximum effect, bombs can be arranged so as to
cause a chain reaction of explosions. The last player left is the winner.
