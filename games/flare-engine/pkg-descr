Flare (Free Libre Action Roleplaying Engine) is a simple game engine
built to handle a very specific kind of game: single-player 2D
action RPGs. Flare is not a reimplementation of an existing game
or engine. It is a tribute to and exploration of the action RPG
genre.

Rather than building a very abstract, robust game engine, the goal
of this project is to build several real games and harvest an engine
from the common, reusable code. The first game, in progress, is a
fantasy dungeon crawl.
