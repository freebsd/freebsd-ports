Peg-E is a peg solitaire game in which you jump over pieces in order
to remove them from the board, ultimately trying to eliminate all
but one. The boards are randomly generated, with 100 levels of
difficulty. The game auto-saves, and has undo-redo capability.
Pieces can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
