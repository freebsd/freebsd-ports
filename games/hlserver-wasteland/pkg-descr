This package contains the files to run a FreeBSD Half-Life
Wasteland server under Linux emulation.

Wasteland Half-Life is a multiplayer mod based in a shattered world.
Nuclear fire has scarred the earth and the survivors fight over
the scraps of what was once their civilization. Some have formed
gangs and tribes to better survive the harsh world their
great-grandparents left them, while some have waited in sealed
underground Vaults for the radiation, viruses, and mutagens unleashed
so many years ago to fade.
