World of Padman (WoP) is an open source first-person shooter computer game
available in both English and German. Originally it was a modification for the
game Quake III Arena titled PadMod created in the year 2004. After the source
code for Quake III Arena was released, the game became standalone. The idea is
based on the Padman comic strip for the magazine PlayStation Games created by
the professional cartoon artist Andreas 'ENTE' Endres, who is also the man who
made many of the maps included with the game in 1998. The current version runs
on an enhanced version of the ioquake3 engine, which is based on the Quake III
Arena engine. Most of the maps in the game are lilliput style, and have a
commercial-quality level of graphic complexity. Because it was originally a
mod for Quake III Arena, most of the gameplay is similar. However, there is no
Capture the Flag mode in World of Padman. World of Padman fully supports bots
with a variety of skill levels in both online and offline play for all of the
game types included. A single-player mode has not yet been implemented.
Players can also record audio and video as they play. The game fully supports
modifications, and custom maps can be created.
