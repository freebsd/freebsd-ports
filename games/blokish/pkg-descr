Clone of the strategy board game 'Blokus'. Four players must place
as many of their 21 pieces on the board as possible while preventing
others from doing the same.

This is made difficult by the fact that a piece played by a player
must touch another of the player's pieces, but only at their corners
(a player's first piece must touch a board corner).

The game is over when no player can play any new pieces. The winner
is the player with the fewest & smallest pieces remaining. Bonus
points are awarded for playing all pieces.

Features a tweakable AI to take the place of any human players.
