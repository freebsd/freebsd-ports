90 Second Portraits is a silly speed painting game developed for
Ludum Dare 31 Jam competition.

Time is money and you have neither! In 90 SECOND PORTRAITS you're
paying the bills by speed painting portraits of bypassing customers!

You have 90 seconds to paint the customer and his/her prefered
background! Your work day ends after 5 customers!
