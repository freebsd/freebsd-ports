Word War vi is your basic side-scrolling shoot 'em up '80s style
arcade game. You pilot your "vi"per craft through core memory,
rescuing lost .swp files, avoiding OS defenses, and wiping out those
memory hogging emacs processes. When all the lost .swp files are
rescued, head for the socket which will take you to the next node
in the cluster.
