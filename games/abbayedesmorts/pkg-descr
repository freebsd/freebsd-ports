In the 13th century, the Cathars, who preach about good Christian
beliefs, were being expelled by the Catholic Church out of the
Languedoc region in France. One of them, called Jean Raymond, found
an old church in which to hide, not knowing that beneath its ruins
lay buried an ancient evil.

A style close to Spectrum ZX, with its dark background and bright
colors, proper fit with the story, because it does look old and
somewhat horrifying. Also, the gameplay is direclty inspired by
Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy.
