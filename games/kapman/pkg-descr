Kapman is a clone of the well known game Pac-Man.

You must run through the maze to eat all pills without being captured
by a ghost.  By eating an energizer, Kapman gets the ability to eat
ghosts for a few seconds.  When a stage is cleared of pills and
energizer the player is taken to the next stage with slightly
increased game speed.
