Spicetrade is a unique, innovative and colourful 14th century Arab spice
trading game with some roleplay elements. You start out as a poor young
lad in Baghdad, and try your luck in the spice trade, with only a house
and some land, but with great plans in mind: travel to Europe and create
your own spice empire!
