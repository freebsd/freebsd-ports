******************************************************

The default location for a configuration files and
saves is no longer ~/.chocolate-doom, current one is
~/.local/share/chocolate-doom/.

You can recreate the sound of the historical vanilla
game according to your own experience.

The default is an emulation of OPL2 Chip (Adlib/
Soundblaster) for MIDI music output. OPL3 is also
available.

If you prefer Gravis Ultrasound, ensure that
audio/guspat is installed, run chocolate-doom-setup,
select "Configure Sound", choose "GUS (emulated)",
and enter the path:

/usr/local/share/guspat/inst/GUS

into the "Path to patch files:" field.

If you wish to enable native MIDI, ensure that a
suitable set of patches is installed such as
audio/eawpats, audio/eawplus, audio/freepats, or
audio/guspat, enter chocolate-doom-setup, select
"Configure Sound", choose "Native MIDI", and enter
the path to the Timidity configuration file.

Examples:

/usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg-eawpats

/usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg-eawplus

/usr/local/share/freepats/freepats.cfg

/usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg-guspat

If you choose either Gravis Ultrasound emulation or
native MIDI and provide no path, there will be no
music.
