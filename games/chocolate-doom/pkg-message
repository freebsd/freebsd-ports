The default location for a configuration files and
saves is no longer ~/.chocolate-doom, current one is
~/.local/share/chocolate-doom/.

You can recreate the sound of the historical vanilla
game according to your own experience.

The default is an emulation of OPL2 Chip (Adlib/
Soundblaster) for MIDI music output. OPL3 is also
available.

If you prefer Gravis Ultrasound, ensure that
audio/guspat is installed, run chocolate-doom-setup,
select "Configure Sound", choose "GUS (emulated)",
and enter the path:

/usr/local/share/guspat/inst/GUS

into the "Path to patch files:" field.

If you wish to enable native MIDI, ensure that a
suitable set of patches is installed such as
audio/eawpats, audio/eawplus, audio/freepats, or
audio/guspat, enter chocolate-doom-setup, select
"Configure Sound", choose "Native MIDI", and enter
the path to the Timidity configuration file.

Examples:

/usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg-eawpats

/usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg-eawplus

/usr/local/share/freepats/freepats.cfg

/usr/local/share/timidity/timidity.cfg-guspat

If you have installed audio/fluidsynth you can also
use samples in the SF2 format.

Alternatively, you can substitute MIDI files with
music packs in .flac or .ogg format.

If you choose either Gravis Ultrasound emulation or
native MIDI and provide no path, there will be no
music.
