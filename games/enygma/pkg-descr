Enigma is a puzzle game involving falling blocks, exploding bombs, and pushing
stuff around. It has elements of Boulderdash and elements of Sokoban, and
anybody old enough to remember XOR on the Spectrum will see large elements of
that in it.
The port and executable have been named 'enygma' to avoid a name collision.
