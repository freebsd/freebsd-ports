If you are experiencing problems reading the Unreal Tournament CD/DVD,
then try mounting it with the -b option.

The following knobs can be specified:
CDROM_MOUNT		Mountpoint for the UT CD/DVD.  Required!
WITH_451PATCH		Install the v451 patch.  This patch fixes some
			issues but introduces new issues.  Note that this
			patch is completely network compatible with v436,
			so you do not need it for online play.
WITHOUT_MAPS		Do not install the maps.
