This is a multiplayer graphical arcade and adventure game made for
the X11 environment.

It has certain flavours from other games, especially Gauntlet (TM)
and Nethack/Moria.

Any number of players can move around in their own window, finding
and using items and battle monsters.  They can choose to cooperate
or compete in the same "world".
