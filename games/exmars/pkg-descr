exMARS combines the latest advance in corewar simulation technology, with
proactive performance optimizations.

Actually exMARS is a redcode simulator, just like exhaust and pMARS. In fact,
I have shamelessly taken sourcecode from pMARS, exhaust, some ideas from
qMars, a shot of optimizations, shook everything well, and garnished
everything with a high level interface for Ruby.

The resulting program has the following main features:

* Uses the parser from pMARS, so no previous parsing is necessary. At first
  this was my main motivation for exMARS.
* Speed: 50% faster than pmars on a Pentium III, and often more than twice as
  fast than pmars on a Pentium 4 (using gcc 3.3.1, and the same compiler
  options).
* Rewritten the code in a more object oriented way, which allows different
  Mars at the same time in the same program, it should also be thread save.
* To get Ruby interface you can install games/ruby-exmars port.
