KnightCap is a chess program.

The principal differences between KnightCap and other chess programs
are:

 - KnightCap has an optional fully rendered 3D interface, giving a feel much
   more like an "over the board" game.

 - KnightCap was developed to run on a parallel distributed memory
   machine, although it also runs on normal Unix boxes.

 - KnightCap does not have an opening book---instead it keeps a file
   (brain.dat) of losing moves and inserts them in the hash table at the
   start of each search. At present it has about 1500 entries, and
   this makes it a pretty competitive opening player.

 - KnightCap learns the parameters of its evaluation function as it
   plays. The most dramatic example of how this helps is an experiment
   we conducted on FICS in which KnightCap learnt from a 1650 player
   to a 2100 player in just 300 games. See

   for more info on its learning algorithm.
