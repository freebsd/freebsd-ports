Please note that the new version of PySolFC contains only a default set of
cards.  If you should miss one or more cardsets, you can set them up as
follows:

$ fetch https://github.com/shlomif/PySolFC-Cardsets/archive/refs/tags/2.0.tar.gz
$ tar xf 2.0.tar.gz
$ cp -r PySolFC-Cardsets-2.0/cardsets* ~/.PySolFC/cardsets/
EOD
}
{ type: upgrade
  maximum_version: 2.16.0
  message: <<EOD
Since PySolFC 2.16 a new high resolution default display was introduced.  It
uses high resolution cardsets and scaling to offer an improved look on larger
monitors.

Please note that the new high-resolution options will not override your
currently selected options for existing users.  If you want to use the new
settings, you can delete or rename your options.cfg file.

Also note that because of these changes, upgrading your version of PySolFC
Cardsets is required even if you're using the minimal package.  If you are
installing from pkg/ports, this will be handled automatically.

If you're using the larger collection of cardsets, please use the following
steps to upgrade your cardsets:

$ mv ~/.PySolFC/cardsets ~/.PySolFC/cardsets.bak
$ fetch https://netcologne.dl.sourceforge.net/project/pysolfc/PySolFC-Cardsets/PySolFC-Cardsets-2.1/PySolFC-Cardsets-2.1.tar.bz2
$ tar xf PySolFC-Cardsets-2.1.tar.bz2
$ mkdir -p ~/.PySolFC/cardsets
$ cp -r PySolFC-Cardsets-2.1/cardset-* ~/.PySolFC/cardsets/
$ rm -r ~/.PySolFC/cardsets.bak
EOD
}
{ type: upgrade
  maximum_version: 3.0.0
  message: <<EOD
Additional cardsets are now also available via the games/pysolfc-cardsets
port in the FreeBSD ports tree.

A manual installation of the additional cardsets via several steps, as
described a while ago, should therefore no longer be necessary.
