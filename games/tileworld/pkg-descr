Tile World is an emulation of the game "Chip's Challenge". "Chip's
Challenge" was originally written for the Atari Lynx by Chuck Sommerville,
and was later ported to MS Windows by Microsoft (among other ports).

"Chip's Challenge" is a game made up of both intellectually engaging
puzzles and situations demanding fast reflexes. As you might have guessed,
it is a tile-based game. The object of each level is simply to get out --
i.e., to find and achieve the exit tile. This simple task, however, can
sometimes be extremely challenging.
