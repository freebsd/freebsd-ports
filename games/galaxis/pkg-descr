			GALAXIS for UNIX

Lifeboats from a crippled interstellar liner are adrift in a
starfield.  To find them, you can place probes that look in all
eight compass directions and tell you how many lifeboats they see.
If you drop a probe directly on a lifeboat it will be revealed
immediately. Your objective: find the lifeboats as quickly as
possible, before the stranded passengers run out of oxygen!

This is a UNIX-hosted, curses-based clone of the nifty little
Macintosh freeware game Galaxis. It doesn't have the super-simple,
point-and-click interface of the original, but compensates by
automating away some of the game's simpler deductions.
