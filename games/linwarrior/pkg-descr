LinWarrior 3D targets to be a somewhat classical open source
Mech-Sim/Game. LinWarrior 3D is not exclusively bound to any specific
classic title. Feel-of-control should *not* be FPS-like but may
still be arcade-like and surrealistic. Classical means that the
primary target of development is single player campaigns and not
realistic graphics or physics.
