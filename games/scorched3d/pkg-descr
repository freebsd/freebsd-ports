Scorched is a game based loosely on the classic DOS game Scorched
Earth "The Mother Of All Games".

	"Scorched Earth is a simple, yet exciting artillery combat
	game, based on an auspicious history of artillery games."

	(Review of Scorched Earth at ClassicGaming.com)

In its simplest form Scorched is an artillery game. Tanks take turns
to earn money by destroying opponents in an arena. Scorched attempts
to recreate the simple yet addictive game play of the original game,
adding amongst other new features a 3D island environment and LAN and
internet play.


You should have 3D hardware accelleration enabled to enjoy a playable
 FPS rate.
