This package does not include any Aleph One data files.  There are a few
ways of getting a fully-playable version of Aleph One:

  * Install the `alephone-data' port.  This port includes the demo files
    from Marathon Infinity.

  * Buy a copy of Marathon 2 or Marathon Infinity and convert those data
    files into the appropriate AlephOne format (http://source.bungie.org
    has more information).

  * Go to http://www.pfhor.net/ei and download one of the new scenarios.
    These scenarios have already been converted to AlephOne.  Demo files
    for Marathon 2 in the AlephOne format are also available at this web
    site.

AlephOne works best with OpenGL; if you do not have an OpenGL-savvy card
and the game is sluggish, try using the -g option to disable OpenGL.
