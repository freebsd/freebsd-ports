Aleph One is the open source version of Bungie's Marathon game.

Marathon is a three-part, first-person shooter series that was published
by Bungie Software.  The complete Marathon trilogy consists of Marathon,
Marathon 2: Durandal, and Marathon Infinity.  The hallmark of the series
is the detailed story-line that unfolds throughout the game.

After Bungie released the source code to the Mac OS version of Marathon,
the Aleph One project was created to enhance the software and port it to
other operating systems.  The project's home page and news site is found
at http://source.bungie.org.  As AlephOne has matured, so have the user-
contributed scenarios, some which far surpass the original Marathon game
scenarios themselves.

Aleph One is OpenGL-accelerated, but performs well without OpenGL if you
do not have a graphics card with the appropriate functionality (you need
to use the -g/--nogl option).
