Atomix is a little mind game where you have to build molecules
out of single atoms. These are laying around between the walls
and obstacles on the playfield. Once you have pushed an atom in
one direction it moves until it hits an obstacle or another
atom. It needs some thinking how to construct complex
molecules with this atom behaviour.
