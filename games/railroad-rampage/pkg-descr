Railroad Rampage is a cross between an arcade game and a strategy
game. It is similiar in construction to many "Tower Defence" games,
but it has a twist: here, you are part of the action and can affect
the game in many different ways more than just building structures.
Bandits are trying to rob your train and steal all precious cargo!
Thankfully, you are a skilled engineer who can construct many
different kinds of turrets and use them to defend your train. You
have to make it through 20 waves of relentless enemy assault before
you reach your destination, so plan ahead and devise a smart strategy
and you may survive!
