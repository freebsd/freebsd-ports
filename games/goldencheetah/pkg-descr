Golden Cheetah is a cycling performance software. It imports ride data
downloaded from various devices or exported from other programs,
including TrainingPeaks WKO+ and the manufacturers' software for the
Ergomo, Garmin, Polar, PowerTap, and SRM devices. It provides a rich
set of analysis tools, including a critical power graph, BikeScore
calculation, histogram analysis, a best interval finder, and a pedal
force versus pedal velocity chart, to name just a few.

KML file support will be missing until libkml 1.3 becomes available.

Connecting with Strava has been made impossible by Strava's own API
Agreement.
