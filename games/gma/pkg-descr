GMA or "The Go-Moku Apprentice" is a computerized go-moku player that learns
playing the game entirely from its opponent.  It was written for fun by
Johan Walles (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se) in October 1998.

The goal of Go-Moku is to get five (or more) marks in a row (horisontally,
vertically or diagonally).  You get to put one mark each time it is your turn.
