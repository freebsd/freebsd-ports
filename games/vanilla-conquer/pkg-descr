Vanilla Conquer is a fully portable version of the first generation C&C
engine and is capable of running both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert on
multiple platforms.  It can also be used for mod development for the
Remastered Collection.

The main focus of Vanilla Conquer is to keep the default out-of-box
experience faithful to what the games were back when they were released
and work as a drop-in replacement for the original executables while
also providing bug fixes, compatibility and quality of life improvements.
