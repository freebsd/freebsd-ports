GalaxyMage is a free, open-source tactical/strategic RPG for Windows,
Linux, FreeBSD and Macintosh.

A tactical RPG is a type of role-playing game where turn-based
battles are fought on a 3D map. Examples of commercial tactical
RPGs include Final Fantasy Tactics, Vandal Hearts, and Disgaea:
Hour of Darkness.

Our goal is to make GalaxyMage a game that is relatively simple to
pick up and play -- you can dive right in without getting bogged
down in the details of the battle mechanics -- but to also allow
for a lot of character development and customization. We also intend
to create a unique, advanced AI system that allows enemy units to
work together as a team and employ a wide variety of strategies.
And eventually, we plan on adding networked multiplayer support.
