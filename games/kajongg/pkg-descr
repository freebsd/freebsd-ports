Kajongg - the classical Mah Jongg for four players. If you are looking
for the Mah Jongg solitaire please use the application KMahjongg.

Kajongg can be used in two different ways. Scoring a manual game where
you play as always and use Kajongg for the computation of scores and
for bookkeeping. Or you can use Kajongg to play against any
combination of other human players or computer players.

Kajongg comes with a ruleset for classical Chinese as played in
Germany. You can change the ruleset at your will and also define whole
new rulesets. The rules for a game are saved in the database, so every
game could be played with different rules. Changing a ruleset does not
affect existing games.
