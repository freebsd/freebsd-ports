Cockatrice is an open-source multiplatform supported program for playing
tabletop card games over a network. The program's server design prevents any
kind of client modifications to gain an unfair advantage in a game. The client
also has a built in single-player mode where you can brew without being
connected to a server. This project is written in C++/Qt with support for both
Qt4 and Qt5.
