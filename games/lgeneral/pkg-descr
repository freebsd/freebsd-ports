LGeneral is a turn-based strategy engine heavily inspired by Panzer
General. You play single scenarios or whole campaigns turn by turn
against a human player or the AI. Entrenchment, rugged defense,
defensive fire, surprise contacts, surrender, unit supply, weather
influence, reinforcements and other implementations contribute to the
tactical and strategic depth of the game.
