ThudBoard - The Discworld Boardgame Board

ThudBoard is a computer application that can be used to play Thud battles
without using the actual board. If you don't have a clue what this Thud thing
is, take a look at the official Thud site at http://www.thudgame.com.

Multiple battles can be stored, so you can play many games simultaneously
without the onerous task of remembering where each individual piece was in
this battle you have been playing with your cousin in XXXX over the last
few years.
