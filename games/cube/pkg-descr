Cube is a 3D First Person Shooter that uses OpenGL and SDL.

Features:
- Allows in-engine editing of geometry in full 3D (you fly around the map, 
point / drag stuff to select it / modify it), which can even be done with 
multiple people at once (a first!). 
- Has simplistic but effective fine grain vertex lighting that looks like 
lightmapping and can do dynamic lights & shadows. 
- Doesn't need any kind of map precompilation, even lighting is done on the 
fly. 
- Has very simplistic quad-tree world structure that can do slopes (heightfields
with caps) and slants, water. 
- Does decent collision detection & physics.
- Has client/server networking that goes a long way in giving a lag-free game 
experience. 
- Features a Doom/Quake-style singleplayer and multiplayer game with some 
uncompromising brutal oldskool gameplay.
