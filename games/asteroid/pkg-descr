Asteroid (just one!) is a modern version of the arcade classic Asteroids,
using OpenGL, GLUT, and optionally GTK and SDL_mixer. It features a variety
of powerups, taunting aliens, 3D textured asteroids, face-melting sound effects,
and infinite playability.

Controls
--------
Use the left and right arrows to turn the ship, x to accelerate, and z to
shoot.  Pressing p will pause the game, f toggles fullscreen mode, and m mutes
and unmutes the audio.  There's also a right-click menu if you forget anything.

Gameplay
--------
I'm not going to explain how to play Asteroids.  I will mention that the
wireframe octahedra that sometimes drift across the screen are powerups.  To
collect the powerups, run over them; or you can shoot them for bonus points
(if you don't want the benefit of the powerup).  You'll have to play the game
to figure out the different powerup types.
