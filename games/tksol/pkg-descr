WHAT IS TKSOL
-------------
TkSol is a version of the card game solitaire written with the Tcl/Tk
language.  A color monitor is highly recommended, especially if you want
to get addicted to the game, as trying to see which card is black and
which is red under monochrome can be rather eye soring :(.  TkSol comes
with a set of cardfront [faceup card] bitmaps created by Joseph L.
Traub (see cardbitmaps/copyright.h).  An initial set of cardback
[facedown card] bitmaps was hacked up by James da Silva
<jds@cs.umd.edu>.
