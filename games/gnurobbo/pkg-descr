GNU Robbo is a free open source reimplementation of LK Avalon's
Robbo for the Atari XE/XL from the late 1980s. The gameplay of the
original is faithfully reproduced with a few modifications :-

 * Lives has been removed and suicide replaced with level restart
 * Scoring has been removed: goal is level advancement
 * Bear logic has been enhanced: fixed endlessly spinning bears
