Set in a futuristic cartoon-like world where rocketlauncher-wielding pigs
and lasergun-carrying cyberpunks roam the streets, Warsow is a completely
free fast-paced first-person shooter (FPS) for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Speed and movement, that's what Warsow is all about.  Like a true
cyberathlete you jump, dash, dodge, and walljump your way through the game.
Grab those power-ups before your enemy does, plant the bomb before anyone
sees you, and steal the enemy's flag before anyone knows what's going on!
