The Butterfly Effect is a physics game about cause and effect.
You build complex mechanical systems using levers, rocket-like cola
bottles and ordinary objects like tennis balls and bikes to
accomplish simple tasks like toppling a Bowling Pin. This is also
known as a Rube Goldberg machine or a Heath Robinson contraption.
This type of game was pioneered by the game series The Incredible
Machine in the 1990s.
