Childsplay is a 'suite' of educational games for young children, like gcompris,
but without the overkill of GNOME environment.  Also the use of the SDL
libraries makes smooth animation and the playing of sound very easy.
Childsplay uses a plugin system for the games, so you might want to check the
childsplay-plugins page.  (There are two built-in games; Memory and a typing
game)
