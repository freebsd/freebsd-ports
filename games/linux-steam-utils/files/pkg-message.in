Please note, this is an unofficial wrapper for the Steam client
and as such it is supported on a best effort basis.

Limitations:

- Sandbox is disabled for the web browser component.
- No controller input, no streaming, no VR.
- Valve Anti-Cheat is untested.
- Steam's container runtime (pressure-vessel) doesn't work.

Additional dependencies:
- If you use an NVIDIA card, you need to install a suitable
  x11/linux-nvidia-libs(-xxx) port.

Steam setup:

1. Set security.bsd.unprivileged_chroot and vfs.usermount sysctls to 1.
2. Add nullfs to kld_list, load it.
3. Create a dedicated FreeBSD non-wheel user account for Steam. Switch to it.
4. Run `%%LOCALBASE%%/steam-utils/bin/lsu-bootstrap` to download the Steam bootstrap executable.
5. Run `steam` to download updates and start Steam.

For the list of tested Linux games see https://github.com/shkhln/linuxulator-steam-utils/wiki/Compatibility.

Native Proton setup (optional, semi-experimental):

1. Run `sudo pkg install wine-proton libc6-shim python3`.
2. Run `%%LOCALBASE%%/wine-proton/bin/pkg32.sh install wine-proton mesa-dri`.
3. In Steam install Proton 8.0 (appid 2348590).

To enable it right click a game title in Steam, click Properties,
click Compatibility, select "FreeBSD Wine (emulators/wine-proton)".
