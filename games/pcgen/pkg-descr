PCGen is a Java-based RPG character generator and maintenance program
that works on all platforms (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, etc).
It currently is aimed at supporting as many rpgs as humanly possible.
Currently our focus is on OGL games (OGL = the Open Gaming License
crafted by Wizards of the Coast).

All datafiles are ASCII so they can be modified by users, and are
available through the pcgendm project. An XML conversion is underway.
