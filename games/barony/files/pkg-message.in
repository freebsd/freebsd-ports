Barony requires the original game files from Barony: Blessed Edition
(e.g. 3.2.x) to work properly.  These can come from the GOG.com
or the Steam versions of the game.

If using the GOG.com version, you should download the Linux version
barony_cursed_edition_en_3_2_2_24038.sh and use the unzip command
line to extract the data.

The files will be in a directory named data/noarch/game.  You can
move the contents of this directory to the %%DATADIR%%
directory for a global install.  You will also need to fix the
permissions on the files.

The easiest way to do this is to follow these steps:

$ unzip barony_cursed_edition_en_3_2_2_24038.sh
$ sudo cp -R data/noarch/game/* %%DATADIR%%
$ sudo find %%DATADIR%% -type d ! -perm 755 -exec chmod 755 {} \;

As an alternative, the game assets can be placed into a personal folder
of your choice and the game can be launched with the -datadir= option,
for example:
$ barony -datadir=$HOME/.barony

You do not have to fix file permissions in this case.
