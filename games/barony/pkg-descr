Barony is a 3D, first-person roguelike.  The goal of the game is
to descend to the bottom of a dark dungeon known as the Devil's
Bastion and destroy an undead lich named Baron Herx, who terrorized
the peaceful town of Hamlet in life and is now harboring a curse
against the land from beyond the grave.  To aid you in your quest
are friendly humans who have been eeking out a rough life within
the dungeon for generations, as well as any friends you can bring
with you in real life: Barony is the first of its kind as a
first-person roguelike in that it fully supports cooperative
multiplayer for up to four players.
