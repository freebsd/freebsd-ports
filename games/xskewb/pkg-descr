Xskewb is a puzzle similar in nature to the famous Rubik's Cube.
Its variations on the inspiration include using 5 blocks per side,
including a large distinct diamond block, and optionally requiring
correct block "orientation".  This is similar to other puzzles
such as the "Creative Puzzle Ball", "Meffert's Challenge", and Disney's
"Mickey's Challenge".  The original design was by Uwe Meffert
("Pyraminx Cube") and coined Skewb by Douglas Hofstadter.

By building from the source and editing its Imakefile before the
``build'' phase, you may be able to use Motif or LessTif with this port.
