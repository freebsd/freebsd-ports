    OpenTTD can use free (libre) data files, split into OpenGFX for
    graphics, OpenSFX for sounds, and OpenMSX for music; it will offer
    to download them upon running the program.  Alternatively, they
    can be installed as corresponding `games/opengfx', `games/opensfx',
    and `games/openmsx' ports or packages.

    If you'd rather use data files from the original Windows version
    of ``Transport Tycoon Deluxe'', copy the following files to your
    $HOME/.openttd/data directory:

	sample.cat
	trg1r.grf
	trgcr.grf
	trghr.grf
	trgir.grf
	trgtr.grf

    If you want the TTD music, copy the gm/ folder from the Windows
    version of TTD to your OpenTTD folder (not your data folder).  The
    music from the DOS version does not work.

    If you are using a non-Latin language, you may see lots of `?'s on
    the screen.  Please open your configuration file and add desired
    fonts (file name with full path).  Bold fonts might look better:

	[misc]
	small_font =
	medium_font =
	large_font =

    Enjoy!!
