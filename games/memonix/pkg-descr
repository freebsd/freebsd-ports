Brain teasers, puzzle and memory games for kid's in one pack!

Memonix is the latest version of a wonderful collection of four
brain twisters, including Mosaic, Builder, Pair and Jig-Saw. While
being amazingly addictive and fun to play, these games can be used
to improve your child's memory, thinking and reaction. Five difficulty
levels from normal to obscene plus the timer mean that the challenge
will never run away. Joyful music and brightly-colored visuals
maximize the excitement from the gameplay.
