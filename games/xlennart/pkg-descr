Yet again, the fate of the world rests in your hands! An evil computer hacker,
known only by his handle 'Lennart', has created the ultimate computer virus. A
virus so powerful that it has the power to transmute an ordinary computer into
a toaster oven. (oooh!) 'Lennart' has cloned himself into a billion-jillion
micro-Lenns.  Their sole purpose is to deliver the nefarious virus, which has
been cleverly diguised as a popularinit system.

As System Administrator/Exterminator, your job is to keep Lennart from
succeeding at his task.
