This is the core pack for RetroArch. Mostly these cores are
intended for playing/interpreting the retrogames. They are for the
most part distributed by the Libretro organization, and are usually
licensed under GPL.

In order to use core packs, you need to know which content can
play on which core.

For example:
* picodrive core can play Sega Genesis console games
* dinothawr core plays the game that can be downloaded from
