The Grind is a simple game about escaping from work at a reasonable hour
by avoiding responsibility.

The goal is to acquire as little work (as few "to-do's") as possible
throughout your 9-5 workday.
Wander around the cubicles and hide from the men in suits--if they're
coming your way, that means they want to give you work!

Use the arrow keys to move, space to start, and escape to exit.
