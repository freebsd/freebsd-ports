Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to Zelda,
made by RTsoft. Besides twisted humour, it includes the actual game
editor, allowing players to create hundreds of new adventures called
Dink Modules or D-Mods for short.

GNU FreeDink is a new and portable version of the game engine, which
runs the original game as well as its D-Mods, with close
compatibility, under multiple platforms.

This is a meta-port to install all the other freedink ports.
