Tsito plays XiangQi (Chinese Chess) against the user or it referees two
players. It can be used on the console (or an xterm) or can communicate through
pipes to a GUI frontend. If used in a console it uses ASCII characters to
display the board on the screen.

'tsito', stands for "The Secret Inside The Orange".
