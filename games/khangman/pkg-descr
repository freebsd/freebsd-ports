KHangMan is a game based on the well-known hangman game. It is aimed
at children aged six and over. The game has several categories of
words to play with, for example: animals (animals words) and three
difficulty categories: easy, medium and hard. A word is picked at
random, the letters are hidden, and you must guess the word by trying
one letter after another. Each time you guess a wrong letter, part of
a picture of a hangman is drawn. You must guess the word before being
hanged! You have 10 tries.
