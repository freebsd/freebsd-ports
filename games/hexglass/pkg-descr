The HexGlass is a Tetris-like puzzle game. Ten different types of
blocks continuously fall from above and you must arrange them to
make horizontal rows of hexagonal bricks. Completing any row causes
those hexagonal blocks to disappear and the rest above move downwards.
The blocks above gradually fall faster and the game is over when
the screen fills up and blocks can no longer fall from the top.
