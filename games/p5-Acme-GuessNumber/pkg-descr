Many people have this experience: You sit before a gambling table. You keep
placing the bet. You know the Goddess will finally smile at you. You just
don't know when. You have only to wait. As the time goes by, the bets in
your hand become fewer and fewer. You feel the time goes slower and slower.
This lengthy waiting process become painfully long, like a train running
straightforwardly into hell. You start feeling your whole life is a failure,
as the jackpot never comes...

But, hey, why so painfully waiting? The Goddess will finally smile at you,
right? So, why not put this painly waiting process to a computer program?
Yes. This is the whole idea, the greatest invention in the century:: An
automatic gambler! There is no secret. It is simple brute force. It
never-endingly runs toward the final jackpot. You can go for other business:
sleep, eat, work. When you finally came back you wins. With it, the hell of
gambling is history!

Remember, that the computer is never affected by emotion, luck, everything.
It never feel anxious or depress. It simply, faithfully, determinedly runs
the probability until the jackpot. As you know, the anxiety and depression
is the enemy of the games, while a simple, faithful and determined mind is
the only path to the jackpot. This makes computer a perfect candidate as a
gambler than an ordinary human.
