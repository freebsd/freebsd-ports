KTX (Kombat Teams eXtreme) is a popular QuakeWorld server modification,
adding numerous features to the core features of the server.

Although it had been developed to be QuakeWorld server agnostic, it
has over the years been developed very close to MVDSV to which it has
become an extent, thus compatibility with other QuakeWorld servers
might not have been maintained.
