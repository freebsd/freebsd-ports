Golddig is a fast action game designed for use with the X window
system.
Makelev is used to create and edit new levels which can be used by
golddig.

The goal in golddig is to pick up all the gold pieces and then go to
the next level without getting eaten by one of the bad guys.  The gold
pieces are distinctive small circular coins.  After picking up all of
the gold, the player must get to an open door or the top row of the
level.  After accomplishing this, the game will start the next level.
