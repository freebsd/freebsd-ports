QTV is a QuakeWorld match broadcasting tool.

The maximum number of players and spectators in QuakeWorld is 32. QTV allows
hundreds and even thousands of spectators to watch the game at the same time.
Also, a delay of about 10 seconds has been added so that spectators cannot
prompt players with information about opponents during the game via voice chats.
In such a dynamic game as QuakeWorld, a lot can change in a few seconds and the
information will be out of date.
