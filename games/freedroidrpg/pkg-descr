The Freedroid RPG is an extension/modification of the classical Freedroid 
engine into an RPG. The main differences to the classical version are as 
follows: 

* The Tux is the main character of the rpg.
* The game uses isometric viewpoint and animated pre-rendered 3d character 
  models for all characters inside the game.
* Dialogs and chatting with friendly droids and humans:
  Multiple-choice menus and voice samples (with subtitles for those
  without sound). 
* There is an item and inventory system that is modeled after some 
  popular standards of the industry :)
* An automap feature was added. (this is currently a bit unmaintained
  since part of the code needs to be re-written for proper OpenGL
  support in the automap display)
* Saving and loading of games.
* Shops to trade things and skills to learn.
* Controls are different:  Mouse is the input method of choice.
* This is a graphically intense game.  Therefore the archive size is
  comparably *huge* and not suitable for modem downloads with a dialup
  connection.
