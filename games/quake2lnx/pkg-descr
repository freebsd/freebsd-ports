Quake2-LNX project aims to further develop and bug fix original Quake II
code released by id Software in 1998, as well as support multiple
architectures (currently i386, alpha, sparc64, and powerpc are supported).
It also includes additional rendering drivers, eyecandy stuff from
Quake2Max project, and experimental IPv6 support.
