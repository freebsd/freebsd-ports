   Mah jongg is an ancient Chinese game whose origins are supposed
to date back around 3000 years. It is typically a four player game
with  similarities  to most  popular card games. This version is a
solitaire  game  using  the  mahjongg  tiles. It was inspired by a
version originally seen on a PC.
   The  object  of  the  game  is to remove all the tiles from the
board  in matching  pairs. Tiles match only if they are identical.
Exceptions  are  the flower and season tiles. Any season tile will
match  any  other  season  tile and any flower tile will match any
other  flower  tile. Tiles  may be  removed from the board only if
they have either a left or a right edge  open and they do not have
a tile covering them.
