Mah jongg is an ancient Chinese game whose origins are supposed to date
back around 3000 years. It is typically a four player game with
similarities to most popular card games. This version is a solitaire
game using the mahjongg tiles. It was inspired by a version originally
seen on a PC.

The object of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board in
matching pairs. Tiles match only if they are identical.  Exceptions are
the flower and season tiles. Any season tile will match any other season
tile and any flower tile will match any other flower tile. Tiles may be
removed from the board only if they have either a left or a right edge
open and they do not have a tile covering them.
