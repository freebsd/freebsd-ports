This package is python adaptor for the poker-eval toolkit for writing
programs which simulate or analyze poker games as found at
http://gna.org/projects/pokersource/. The python interface is
somewhat simpler than the C API of poker-eval. It assumes that the
caller is willing to have a higher level API and is not interested in
a one to one mapping of the poker-eval API.
