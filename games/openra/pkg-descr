A reimplementation of the Command & Conquer: Red Alert game engine
using .NET/Mono, OpenGL, OpenAL and SDL. It includes reimaginations
of Command & Conquer: Red Alert, Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn as
well as Dune 2000. These combine the classic gameplay of the originals
with modern improvements such as unit veterancy and the fog of war.
