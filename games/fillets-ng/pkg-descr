Fish Fillets NG is strictly a puzzle game. The goal in every of the
seventy levels is always the same: find a safe way out. The fish
utter witty remarks about their surroundings, the various inhabitants
of their underwater realm quarrel among themselves or comment on
the efforts of your fish. The whole game is accompanied by quiet,
comforting music.
