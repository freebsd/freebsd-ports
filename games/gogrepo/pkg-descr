A Python-based tool for downloading your GOG.com game collections and
extras to your local computer for full offline enjoyment.

It is a clean standalone python script that can be run from anywhere.
It requires a typical Python 2.7 or 3.x installation and html5lib.

By default, game folders are saved in the same location that the script
is run in. You can also specify another directory. Run gogrepo.py -h to
see help or read more below. Each game has its own directories with all
game/bonus files saved within.
