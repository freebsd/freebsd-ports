========================================================================

If you use an Intel graphics adapter and experience missing or
corrupted textures during gameplay, try launching doomsday with the
"-notexcomp" option.

If you get the error message "Variable 'audio.soundPlugin' not found"
after upgrade from 1.15, remove the file ~/.doomsday/runtime/persist.pack
and try to start doomsday again.
