Remember that Allacrost is still a work in progress, and this release
remains a fair distance from what we want this game to eventually
become. Please share with us your comments, critiques, and thoughts
on our forum (http://www.allacrost.org/forum) after you play so we
can absorb your feedback for our next release. If you have any
issues with playing our demo, you can leave us a note on the forum
or stop by our IRC channel (#allacrost at irc.freenode.net) and
we'll help you out. Have fun!

NOTE: If you experience sound problems with allacrost (music is
harsh and choppy), try creating ~/.openalrc with single line:

(define devices '(sdl))
