Quake III Arena mod: Weapons Factory Arena, is one of the most complex,
dynamic, and fast-paced modifications for Quake III Arena written to date.

It requires the standard deathmatch skills of any Quake game, plus the added
strategy of team-based CTF, with the tactical skill of mastering and
understanding eight different classes and over twenty different weapons.

Your goal in every game will be to evaluate what your team needs most, then
to choose the class that will properly augment your team and lead them to
victory.

The best way to start in WFA is to learn the basics of each class: their
specialties and nuances, strengths and weaknesses.  And the best class to
start with is the marine.
