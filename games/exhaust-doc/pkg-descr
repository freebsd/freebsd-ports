The `exhaust' project is a redcode simulator that is (hopefully) easy to embed
into your applications, as an alternative to pMARS.

The documentation contains the following:

README     -  Instructions to embed exhaust in a program.
test.pl    -  Perl script to check for differences between exhaust and pMARS.
src/       -  The C source code of exhaust (highly commented).
warriors/  -  Test warriors.

The "warriors" subdirectory contains Redcode assembly files (.red) and parsed
Redcode assembly files (.rc). The last ones can be loaded into exhaust, the
others have to be parsed, for example with pMARS.

NOTE: this documentation is only useful for developers.
