The goal of the game is to arrange twelve suits of cards, in order, 
onto twelve playing decks.  When the game starts, one card face down 
and one card face up is dealt to each of the playing decks.

This game is a little harder than most because a different deck of 
cards is used. Sounds effects are also built in.
