RealTimeBattle is a programming game for Unix-like systems, in which robots 
controlled by programs coded in any language are fighting with each other. 
The general intend is to destroy the enemies, by using the radar to locate 
them and firing them to oblivion with the cannon. Great tool for learning
how to code in C/C++ or other languages.
