To quote the author, Bill Kendrick's homepage,

"X-Bomber is a multiplayer game for Unix running the X-Window system.
It's based on "Super Bomberman" for the Super Nintendo home game system (which
is based on "Atomic Bomberman" by InterPlay and "Bomberman" by Hudsonsoft.)
For a great starting point on the "real" Super Bomberman, check out
Tony Hsieh's Super Bomberman page."
