Xdémineur is a minesweeper game for the X Window System.

The object of this game is to find the location of the mines
hidden in the minefield and to mark their location by placing a
warning flag.  You have exactly as many flags as there are mines.
The number of flags that remain to be placed is displayed in the
top left corner of the window and a timer is displayed in the top
right corner.
