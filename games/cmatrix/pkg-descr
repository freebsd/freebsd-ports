CMatrix - show a scrolling 'Matrix' like screen (curses based)

CMatrix by default operates in 'eye candy' mode.  It must be aborted with
control-c.  If you wish for more of a 'screen saver' effect, you must
specify -s on the command line.  For usage, use cmatrix -h.

If you have any suggestions/flames/patches to send, please feel free to
do so.  Please do not critique my code, I know I'm a hack ;-)  I just got
the urge to write this one evening, and decided to see how fast I could do
it.  It's probably not particularly portable or efficient, but I'm pretty
sure it wont hog *too* much CPU time.

This software is provided under the GNU GPL.  I am in no way affiliated
in any way with the movie 'The Matrix', just a big fan.
