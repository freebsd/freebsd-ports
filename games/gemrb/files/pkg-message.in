You will need one of the original Infinity Engine games or the free Baldur's Gate II
demo. GemRB does not support the Enhanced Edition versions of the games. GemRB comes
with its own short demo.

GemRB needs access to game files. You have several options to provide the files:
  - copy from a Windows system
  - install with emulators/wine
  - extract with archivers/unshield and archivers/cabextract
    (https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/wiki/Unshield:-alternative-game-install-method)
  - use the custom GemRB games installers
    (http://git.njw.name/cgit/cgit.cgi/gemrb-gameinstallers)

Additionally, %%ETCDIR%%/GemRB.cfg needs to be edited to point to the Infinity
Engine game installation directory, i.e. the directory where you provide the game
files from above. If it doesn't point to a valid game directory then GemRB will
start its demo instead.

Please see https://www.gemrb.org for additional help and instructions.
