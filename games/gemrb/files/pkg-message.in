===============================================================================
To use GemRB, you must copy the Chitin.key from your respective Infinity Engine 
game CD to the GemRB directory.  If you do not copy this file, GemRB will not 
work. Additionally, %%ETCDIR%%/GemRB.cfg needs to be edited to point to the
Infinity Engine game installation directory. Games can be installed with
emulators/wine-devel, archivers/unshield, or the custom GemRB game installer:

Please see http://www.gemrb.org/ for additional help and instructions.
