"Circus Linux!" is a clone of the Atari 2600 game "Circus Atari",
produced by Atari, Inc. (which is itself a clone of an earlier
arcade game named, simply "Circus").

The object is to move a teeter-totter back and forth across the
screen to bounce clowns up into the air. When they reach the top,
they pop rows of balloons and then fall back down.

The gameplay is similar to the classics "Breakout" and "Arkanoid".
