The EDGE project is a programming project to develop a DOOM style engine aimed
at the Total Conversion developer, but still able to play the original DOOM
games. This project started with the DOOM source released by id software.

Note that it currently does not support playing the original MIDI music, but
supports OGG Vorbis audio files.
