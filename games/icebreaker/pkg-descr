IceBreaker is a game similar to Jezzball or Barrack. So, uh, there's a bunch of
penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You have been selected to catch them so
they can be shipped to Finland, where they are essential to a secret plot for
world domination.

In order to trap the penguins, you'll need to break the iceberg into small
chunks. (They're afraid of water, for no apparent reason.) You do this by
melting lines in the ice with Special High-Tech GNU Tools.

If a penguin hits a line in progress, however, it vanishes with a loud noise,
and you lose a life. (Yes, a life. This story is really breaking down, isn't
it? But never fear -- I'll keep going until it's completely dead.)

Once 80% or more of the iceberg is gone, the remaining chunks are small enough
for shipping. Of course, if you manage to get rid of more than that, you'll
save on postage, thus earning you exponential amounts of Geek Cred (a.k.a.
"score").

After you ship off one batch of penguins, it's time to move on to the next.
Each subsequent 'berg will have one more penguin, and you'll have one more
life. This will continue until you lose, or until you exceed level one hundred
or so, which Ain't Gonna Happen.
