Widelands is an open source real-time strategy game inspired by Bluebyte's
Settlers II (TM). You are the chieftain of a small tribe. To grow your kingdom,
you must secure resources, construct new buildings, train soldiers and wage
war against your opponents.

The game is playable and great fun already, but it is also still under heavy
development, so do not be surprised if it crashes on you.
