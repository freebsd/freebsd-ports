This project aims to reimplement the game engine of Theme Hospital, and be
able to load the original game data files.  This means that you will need
a purchased copy of Theme Hospital, or a copy of the demo, in order to use
CorsixTH.  After most of the original engine has been reimplemented, the
the project will serve as a base from which extensions and improvements to
the original game can be made.
