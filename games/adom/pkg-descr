Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM for short) is a rogue-like game
which means that it is a single-user game featuring the exploration
of a dungeon complex (and in the case of ADOM a few other games of
this genre: the exploration of a large wilderness area with
villages and many special locations). You control a fictional
character described by race, class, attributes, skills, and
equipment. This fictional character is trying to achieve a specific
goal and succeed in a difficult quest. To fulfill the
quest, you have to explore previously undiscovered tunnels and
dungeons, fight hideous monsters, uncover long forgotten secrets,
and find treasures of all kind.
