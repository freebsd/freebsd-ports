Hex-a-hop is a puzzle game based on hexagonal tiles. There is no time limit and
no real-time elements.

The objective is simply to destroy all the green hexagonal tiles on each of the
100 levels. As you progress through the game, more types of tiles are introduced
which make things more difficult and interesting (hopefully).
