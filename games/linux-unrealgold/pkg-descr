Your ship has just crashed on an unknown planet. Your best friend has just been
eaten by an alien. And all you have got is a desire to go home. This can't be
real, you tell yourself. This can't be real. It's not. It's Unreal!

Unreal Gold contains the original Unreal game as well as the mission pack,
Return to Na Pali.

You need an original game CD to use this port:

Unreal Gold CD
Unreal Anthology DVD
Unreal Gold CD for Linux by ravage

Also this port requires Unreal Tournament 436 (games/linux-ut) to be installed
and working.
