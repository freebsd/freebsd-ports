GNUjump is a clone of the simple yet addictive game Xjump, adding
new features like multiplaying, unlimited FPS, smooth floor falling,
themable graphics, sounds, replays, ...

The goal in this game is to jump to the next floor trying not to
fall down. As you go upper in the Falling Tower the floors will
fall faster. Try to survive longer get upper than anyone. It might
seem too simple but once you've tried you'll realize how addictive
this is.
