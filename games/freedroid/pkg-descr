Freedroid is a clone of the classic game "Paradroid" on Commodore 64 with some
improvements and extensions to the classic version. 

In this game, you control a robot, depicted by a small white ball with a few
numbers within an interstellar spaceship consisting of several decks connected
by elevators. 

The aim of the game is to destroy all enemy robots, depicted by small black
balls with a few numbers, by either shooting them or seizing control over them
by creating connections in a short subgame of electric circuits.
