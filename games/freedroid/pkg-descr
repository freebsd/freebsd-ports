Freedroid is a clone of the game "Paradroid" which was released on Commodore
64 in 1985. In this game, you control a robot located within an interstellar
spaceship consisting of several decks connected by elevators.

The aim of the game is to destroy all enemy robots by either shooting them
or seizing control over them by creating connections in a short subgame
of electric circuits. The graphics are designed to be a fairly faithful
reproduction of the original game, but a modern set of tiles is also
available.
