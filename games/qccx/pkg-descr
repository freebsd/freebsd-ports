QCCX is the world's first optimizing QuakeC compiler with support for string
manipulation, pointers, integers, arrays, and ``for'' loops.  It is also the
fastest QuakeC compiler out there (at least at its time).  QCCX is based on
FastQCC which was, in turn, based on QCCDOS.  Use it the same way you use any
other QuakeC compiler.
