You are a lone adventurer in a strange world, where geometry does
not work in the expected way. Gather as much treasure as you can
before the nasty monsters get you. Explore several different worlds,
each with its own unique treasures, enemies, and terrain obstacles.
Your quest is to find the legendary treasure, the Orbs of Yendor.
Collect one of them to win! Or just ignore your quest and collect
smaller treasures.

The twist is the unique, unusual geometry of the world: it is one
of just few games which takes place on the hyperbolic plane. Witness
a grid composed of hexagons and heptagons, straight lines which
seem to be parallel, but then they diverge and never cross, triangles
whose angles add up to less than 180 degrees, how extremely unlikely
is it to reach the same place twice, and how the world seems to be
rotated when you do return. All this matters for the gameplay. The
game is inspired by the roguelike genre (although in a very minimalist
way), works of M. C. Escher, and by puzzle games such as Deadly
Rooms of Death.
