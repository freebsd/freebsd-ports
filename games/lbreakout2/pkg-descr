The polished successor to LBreakout offers you a new challenge in more than 50
levels with loads of new bonuses (goldshower, joker, explosive balls, bonus
magnet ...), maluses (chaos, darkness, weak balls, malus magnet ...) and special
bricks (growing bricks, explosive bricks, regenerative bricks, indestructible
bricks, chaotic bricks).

And if you're through with all the levels you can create complete new levelsets
with the integrated easy-to-use level editor!
