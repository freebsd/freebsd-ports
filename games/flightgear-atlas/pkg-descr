Atlas aims to produce and display high quality charts of the world for users of
FlightGear, an open source flight simulator. This is achieved through two main
parts: The map creator (simply called Map) and the Atlas viewer.

The map creator takes scenery data from FlightGear and transforms it into
beautiful map pictures that can be viewed with any bitmap image program that
you might have installed or with the Atlas viewing application.

The Atlas viewing application can be used for browsing your maps but can also
connect directly to FlightGear and display your aircrafts current location on a
so called moving map display.
