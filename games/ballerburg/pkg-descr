Ballerburg SDL is a classical castle combat game. Two castles, separated by a
mountain, try to defeat each other with their cannonballs, either by killing the
opponent's king or by weakening the opponent enough so that the king
capitulates.

Ballerburg was originally written 1987, for the Atari ST machines.
