NVIDIA users have probably to add the following to the
environment variables section:

LD_LIBMAP       libGLX.so       libGL-NVIDIA.so
                libGLX.so.0     libGL-NVIDIA.so.1

For older cards that dont support OpenGL 4
you have to add the following to the environment variables section:

MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE 3.2
MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE 330

In case that the mod Sodium complains about incompatible LWJGL version,
it's possible to set the Java argument -Dsodium.checks.issue2561=false
to workaround it. Please note that this makes it difficult to diagnose
crashes at startup or that it might not even work at all.

Have Fun!
EOM
