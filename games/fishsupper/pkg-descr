Fish Supper is a simple arcade/puzzle game, loosely based on the
retro classic Frogger.

Guide a cat across a series of rivers, jumping from log to log to
reach a tasty fish supper on the other side. Make sure you've got
a crystal the same colour as the log before you land on it, though,
or you'll be zapped back to the beginning.
