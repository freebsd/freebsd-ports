Your computer has been invaded! Dozens of little viruses are pouring in via
security holes in Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft
MSN Messenger and Microsoft Recycle Bin!! Using your trusty mouse you must
shoot the buggers before they can destroy your files! Some will steal them
from their home directories and take them back to their security hole. Others
will just eat them right there on the spot! See how long you and your computer
can survive the onslaught!
