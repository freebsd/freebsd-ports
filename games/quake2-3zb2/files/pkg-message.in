3ZB2 has been installed.

Due to the game library (i.e. game.so file) being unable to read the
filesystem paths (i.e. %%Q2DIR%% in the client
(i.e. quake2 executable), it will look for and write node files in the current
directory. So you have to do the following (only once) in the directory where
you want to run it from (you could use ~/.quake2 for example):

$ mkdir -p ~/.quake2/3zb2
$ cd %%Q2DIR%%/3zb2
$ cp -r 3ZBConfig.cfg 3ZBMaps.lst chctf chdtm ~/.quake2/3zb2

Then run it from the recently created directory.

$ cd ~/.quake2
$ quake2 +set game 3zb2

See the docs in %%DOCSDIR%% for help on using it.

Check the website for additional DM and CTF maps (respective routes section).
