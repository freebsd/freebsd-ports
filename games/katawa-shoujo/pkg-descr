Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional
Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern
Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life
turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move
to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his
difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends - and perhaps love, if he
plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the
5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining
to that character.

This package contains English, Spanish, French, Italian and Japanese versions.
