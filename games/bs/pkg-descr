Battleships solitaire game with a color point-and-shoot
interface in the style of blue and galaxis games.

				BS 2.0

Battleships is an intrinsically silly game, but I couldn't resist fixing this
sucker. It now has a purely visual interface (you place ships and call for
shots by moving the cursor around the board using the standard yuhjklbn keys).

The default game now disallows placement of ships so that they touch. A new
-c option is available to force the older behavior.

I also removed the `seemiss' option (now always on) and `ask' (which is only
useful for cheating). And I ifdefed out the ditsy opening screen; if you want
it back, compile with -DPENGUIN. One strike against featureitis...

The code now lints as clean as the broken SysV curses lint library will let it.

Some #ifdefs in the code should result in the right things being done for
BSD or USG systems. They key off A_UNDERLINE.  If you're using the Linux
ncurses library, tell the makefile.

This was probably a waste of a day or so. But what the hack -- rewriting the
strategy robot as an FSM was fun, and maybe the interface will set a good
example for the next guy.

<*** FLAME ON ***>

People who write termcap games that require you to enter #@!!#$! coordinates
rather than doing the natural pick-and-place with cursor motions should be
stuffed in suits and condemned to write COBOL for the rest of their days...

<*** FLAME OFF ***>

O.K., I feel better now that I've got that off my chest...

November 1993: I've added function key support, and ANSI/POSIXized the code.
