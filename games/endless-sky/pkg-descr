Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers,
or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or
to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up
pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and
hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized
than your own...

Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to
Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain
of a tiny space ship and can choose what to do from there. The game
includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can
choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on
your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.
