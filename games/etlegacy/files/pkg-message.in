Enemy Territory Legacy (native version) has been installed.

1) In order to run ET: Legacy you will need to copy the original pak0.pk3
assets file to the etmain folder. In addition, third party mods might also
require the pak1.pk3 and pak2.pk3 assets files.

Download them from https://mirror.etlegacy.com/etmain/ to

%%PREFIX%%/lib/etlegacy/etmain/ or ~/.etlegacy/etmain/

2) Enjoy it :)
EOM
