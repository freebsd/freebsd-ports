ET: Legacy is an open source project based on the code of Wolfenstein: Enemy
Territory which was released in 2010 under the terms of the GPLv3.

There are two aspects to this project:

- An updated game engine, ET: Legacy, which aims to fix bugs and security
exploits, remove old dependencies, add useful features and modernize its
graphics while still remaining compatible with ET 2.60b and as many of its mods
as possible.

- A new mod, Legacy, which aims to add many useful features and improvements
while staying close to the original gameplay, as well as being lightweight and
extensible through Lua scripts.
