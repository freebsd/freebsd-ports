Spring is a full 3D RTS game engine, designed, in it's basis, to
be able to run the content of the game Total Annihilation and deliver
a similar, but improved, gaming experience.

Games can be intense and very large scaled, with fight of, literally,
hundreds of unit and the mods allow very wide arrays of diferent
strategies and tactics.
