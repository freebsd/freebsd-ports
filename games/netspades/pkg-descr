Spades (known in some places as 500) is a four-player, team-based
game whose object is to be the first team to score 500 points by
bidding on, and taking tricks.

NetSpades includes:
- the server program,
- a console-based client (using the SLang library),
- and an X-based client (using the GTK library).
