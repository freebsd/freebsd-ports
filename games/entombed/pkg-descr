Wikipedia "Entombed (video game)"

You and your team of archeologists have fallen into the
"catacombs of the zombies". There's no time for research, though;
the walls are closing in, and the zombies have sprung to life!

Fortunately, you've discovered an ancient mystical potion which allows you to
create and destroy walls. Bottles of this potion are strewn about the catacombs.
Grab them, and you can break through walls when you get stuck,
or create a wall behind you, if you're being chased.

The longer you survive, the faster you have to move.
