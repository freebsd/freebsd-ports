	This is xbattle by Greg Lesher, based on the original by Steve Lehar
released in 1991, and including enhancements, modifications, and bug fixes by
contributers from all over the world.
	It is a concurrent multi-player game which combines elements of strategy
with arcade-like action to capture a wide range of military scenarios.  The game
is based on X Windows.  Opponents play from separate displays, with commands
being executed concurrently--the players do not take "turns", but rather they
all issue their commands simultaneously.  There can be any number of players,
with each player assigned to a specific team, indicated by marker colors.  The
game board is a matrix of cells (square, hexes, etc.) that can be occupied by
colored troops, with the goal of the game being to eliminate the enemy from the
board by attacking cells occupied by enemy troops.  A wide variety of command
line options (and previously configured game files) provide an abundance of
different scenarios and gaming environments.
	If you have never used xbattle before, read the introduction on the
xbattle Web site.  To get the feel of the game, you can run the "tutorial1" and
"tutorial2" scripts supplied with the game.  These start a series of small
example games that you can play around with to learn the various options
available with the game.
