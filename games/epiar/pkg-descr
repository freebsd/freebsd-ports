Epiar (ep-ee-are) is an open source computer game, in which the player
navigates space from planet to planet, saving money to buy ship upgrades
and new ships. The player can also join mercenary missions, attack other
ships to steal their money and technology, and explore the universe.
The game combines the action/arcade elements of aircraft dogfighting and
the openness of role playing games to create this experience.

Epiar is a space exploration/combat/trading game. The Escape Velocity (EV)
series for the Mac was the major point of inspiration for this game.
Other notable games of this genre include:

- Elite (the original game EV was based on)
- Star control 1/2 (and it's now open source successor Ur-Quan masters)
- Star Flight
- Solar Winds
