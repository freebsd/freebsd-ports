Almost everyone has heard of the Worms(R) series of games, developed
by Team17.  Worms was created in 1990, the goal of the game consisting
of a several teams of "worms" fighting to the death on a 2D map.
WarMUX (WAR of Mascots from UniX) is heavily influenced by all games
in this genre, including Scorched Earth and Liero.

WarMUX is free software clone of this game concept.  Though currently
under heavy development, it is already very playable, with lots of
weapons (Dynamite, Baseball Bat, Teleportation, etc.).  There are
also lots of maps available for your battling pleasure!  WarMUX
takes the genre to the next level, with great customisation options
leading to great gameplay.  There is a wide selection of teams,
from the Aliens to the Chickens.  Also, new battlefields can be
downloaded from the Internet, making strategy an important part of
each battle.
