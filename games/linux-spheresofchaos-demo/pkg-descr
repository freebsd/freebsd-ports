From the readme.txt file:

Spheres of Chaos is a hectic, fast-paced, and rather colourful arcade game in
the old-school style.

Fly a ship around, dodging amongst hordes of assorted strange objects that
subdivide when you shoot them. Earn bonus ships for score, Collect tokens for
extra-powers. Battle the big aliens and other wierd things that occasionally
appear. Survive as the game gets ever faster and more manic.
