Based on the popular Quake3 modification, "True Combat", TC:E provides
a realistic combat simulator set against the backdrop of modern urban
warfare. The player can expect thrilling shootouts, an emphasis on
tactical team play, engaging close quarter fighting and some of the
best weapons of modern warfare. Being accessible to both veteran
players and those new to the world of tactical simulators is only one
of TC:E's many strengths. Map authors can customize weapon load outs,
skins, objectives and even the voice chats for each of their maps.

Key features:
    * A full game completely free for download
    * Mission-based online multiplayer game
    * Soft player class system (assault, recon, sniper)
    * Rounds with skill-based "Armament Availability System"
    * Voice Communication System designed in collaboration with real
      SWAT Members
    * Iron sight aiming system with ACOG and reflex sights
    * Still in development: mission system - future versions will
      integrate various objectives into the game
