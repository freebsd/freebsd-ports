"Gish isn't your average hero, in fact he's not your average
anything... see Gish is a ball of tar. A Sunday stroll with his
lady friend Brea goes awry when a shadowy figure emerges from an
open man hole and pulls Brea into the ground below. Following
Brea's calls for help Gish suddenly finds himself in the
subterranean sewers of Dross, a long forgotten city filled with
twisting corridors, evil traps and some of the most demented
creatures imaginable."
