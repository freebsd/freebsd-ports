EmptyEpsilon places you in the roles of a spaceship's bridge officers, like
those seen in Star Trek. While you can play EmptyEpsilon alone or with friends,
the best experience involves 6 players working together on each ship.

Each officer fills a unique role: Captain, Helms, Weapons, Relay, Science, and
Engineering. Except for the Captain, each officer operates part of the ship
through a specialized screen. The Captain relies on their trusty crew to report
information and follow orders.
