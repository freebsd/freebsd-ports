NOTE: This is only the engine. If you wish to play a game that uses the 
Stratagus engine, you must manually download the Stratagus game data. 

You can use the 'games/wargus' port to extract data from a legal copy of 
Warcraft 2 (original DOS version required, won't work with the battle.net 
edition).

For more information, please take a look at the following URL:

Enjoy!
