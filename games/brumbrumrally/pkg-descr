Brum Brum Rally is a 2D racing game with a new track each time you
play and support for up to 8 players.

The cars can be controlled using keyboard, mouse or game controllers.
The tracks are autogenerated on the fly which means you never have
to be bored playing the same tracks over and over again.

There are three game modes to choose from:

- Single Race and Tournament can be played against the computer or
  with other human players, on the same computer or over the network
  (LAN or Internet).

- The Time Trial mode on the other hand is played by one player at
  a time. The task is to finish the race as fast as possible in order
  to beat your own best time or end up on the overall top list.
