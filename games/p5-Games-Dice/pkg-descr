Games::Dice simulates die rolls. It uses a function-oriented (not
object-oriented) interface. No functions are exported by default.

The number and type of dice to roll is given in a style which should be
familiar to players of popular role-playing games: adb[+-*/b]c. a is optional
and defaults to 1; it gives the number of dice to roll. b indicates the number
of sides to each die. % can be used instead of 100 for b; hence, rolling 2d%
and 2d100 is equivalent. roll simulates a rolls of b-sided dice and adds
together the results. The optional end, consisting of one of +-*/b and a
number c, can modify the sum of the individual dice. +-*/ are similar in that
they take the sum of the rolls and add or subtract c, or multiply or divide
the sum by c. (x can also be used instead of *.) Using b in this slot is a
little different: it's short for "best" and indicates "roll a number of dice,
but add together only the best few". For example, 5d6b3 rolls five six- sided
dice and adds together the three best rolls.
