Phlipple is a unique puzzle game. The goal of every level is to
reduce a 3D shape to a single square. Elimination of squares is
done by flipping edges around just like in a cardboard box.

It starts off relatively easy to teach the basics just to later on
serve hours of brain tickling fun. It's a great way to train memory
as well as orientation in 3D.
