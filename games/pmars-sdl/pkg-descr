Port of pMARS using the Simple Directmedia Library. Currently the port is in
beta testing stage testing and bug reports/feature requests are more than
welcome. The latest release is version 0.9.2-5.

Features/fixes:

* Environment sensitive. Now looks for macro files in the directory specified
  by the environment variable PMARSHOME if they are not found in the current
  directory.
* Both Win32 and X11 supported.
* Command line history using Shift-Up and Shift-Down keys.
* Rewrote text display and screen update routines for faster text panels (for
  slow computers like mine.)
* BIG core cells for those tiny cores. (Choose a display mode larger than 2,
  e.g. -v 134.)
