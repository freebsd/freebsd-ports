An arcade game best described as a cross between pacman and fastfood.
Collect the pills and carrots while avoiding the ghosts! Cute and colourful!

Basically, it's pacman with a fast food twist. You have to get the pills,
pacman style, while also collecting the carrots that move around the mazes.
There are also different styles of gates to make things trickier. These are:

* Red and White - only the ghosts can cross them
* Blue and White - only hannah can cross them
* Wooden gates - both hannah and the ghosts can cross, but only passing from
   below to above
* Red prison door things - need hannah to get the red key to open

There are some command line switches you can use:

-fullscreen will put the game in fullscreen mode
-map X will start the game on level X
