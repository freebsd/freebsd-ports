Formido is one of those games, where you are loaded with some guns
and you go shooting different things. 'Things' in this case are
big, ugly, - not green though - alien insects. The idea is to kill
as many of those bastards as possible. Eventually they will overcome
you, but struggle as long as you can. There are some power-ups to
aid you in your honorable quest. Keep in mind, that those critters
are rather tough and generally do nasty things when in close range
of any player-characters.
