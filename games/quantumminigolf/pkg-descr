The game quantum minigolf is nearly the same as the game minigolf
- except that the ball obeys the laws of quantum mechanics.

Such a ball can be at several places at once. It can diffract around
obstacles and interfere with itself. Apart from that, the rules are
the same: You can play on various tracks involving various obstacles.
You hit the ball with a club and try to kick it into a hole on the
other side of the track.
