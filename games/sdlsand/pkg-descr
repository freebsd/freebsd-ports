The SDL Sand game (The Falling SDL-Sand Game) is a C++ implementation of the
original 'World of Sand' (and later 'Hell of Sand') game implemented in JAVA.
SDL Sand uses the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Library - http://www.libsdl.org/)
library for screen output. Therefore the implementation can possibly run on
every platform supported by SDL.
