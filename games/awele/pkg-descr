The game of Awele is a popular african game, also known as "Sungo"
or "Ubao". It is made of a wooden board with 12 holes containing
some kind of stones. The aim is to capture as many stones as
possible. There exist varieties of rules. I implemented the one
I know, which is one of the most popular (in Ivory Coast at least).
