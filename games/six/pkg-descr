Six plays Hex, a game with very simple rules and deep tactical complexity. 
Two players, one with black and one with white pieces, alternate
placing marks on a rhombic board of hexagonal cells. Black's goal is to 
connect the two opposite black sides of the board with black pieces. 
White's goal is to connect the white sides of the board with white pieces.
