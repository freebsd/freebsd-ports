======================================================================
You installed leela-zero: the Go engine.

You need at least one OpenCL provider installed in order for leela-zero
to run.

To see the list of OpenCL providers, install the 'clinfo' package and run:
$ clinfo

If 'clinfo' shows zero providers, you need to install some providers,
for example:
* pocl: for a simple CPU provider
* beignet: for the Intel GPU provider
* etc.
