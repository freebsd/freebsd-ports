iMaze is a multi-player network action game for TCP/IP with 3D graphics
under X11 (XView, Motif or Athena). You run through a labyrinth and shoot
everything that is round without being hit by other round anythings.

Of course anything round is one of the following:
 * other players playing over the net
 * computer controlled ninjas
 * deadly shots (except your own)

Features:
 * sophisticated, reliable network protocol, works even with SLIP connections
   via modem; modular, portable source code
 * windows can be freely scaled to avoid speed drawbacks due to poor display
   performance
 * sound and joystick support
 * scores; camera mode; labyrinth generator and interactive labyrinth editor

Audio support is somewhat flaky on FreeBSD (synchronization problems).
It works better with the old Voxware driver than with the current pcm driver.
