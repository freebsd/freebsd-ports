Tetris meets Pong, with more twists than a contortionist club's
secret handshake. Sometimes, the total is greater than the sum of the parts.
Tetris and Pong are classics, addictive and unshakable from their places in
gaming history. TONG is the result of mixing the two, capitalizing on the
essential qualities of each classic and adding new twists of its own to make
an explosive chemical reaction out of it all.
