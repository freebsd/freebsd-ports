DXX-Rebirth is a source port of the Descent and Descent 2 engines
for Windows, Mac OS, Linux (most *NIX systems), offering OpenGL
graphics and effects, advanced multiplayer, many improvements and
new features.

Descent and Descent 2 are pretty old games so you usually run into
problems running it on more recent hardware and operating systems.
DXX-Rebirth will also take care about this for you.
