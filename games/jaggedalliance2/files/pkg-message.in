This Jagged Alliance 2 port requires data files from the original
game CD and installation, see https://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/how-to-run/.

Basically to make it run you need "Data" dir from installed game root dir.
Copy it as %%DATADIR%%/data.
Or copy it as "data" dir under "game_dir" dir set in your ~/.ja2/ja2.json.
