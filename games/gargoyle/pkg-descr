Gargoyle is an IF player that supports all the major interactive
fiction formats.

Most interactive fiction is distributed as portable game files. These
portable game files come in many formats. In the past, you used to
have to download a separate player (interpreter) for each format of IF
you wanted to play.

Gargoyle is based on the standard interpreters for the formats it
supports: Agility, Alan 2 and 3, Frotz, Glulxe, Hugo, Level 9,
Magnetic, Scare, Tads 2 and 3.
