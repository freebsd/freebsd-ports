In 2000, Raven Software released the source code to their class based
shooter game Hexen II and its multiplayer extension HexenWorld.

Since then, there has been some source ports of this game, most notably
the now neglected Anvil of Thyrion project. But nothing has been done
for Linux since the beginning of 2002.

The Hammer of Thyrion project continues the development for Linux and
BSD people, with continued support for Windows users as well. Many bugs
are fixed and even new features are added:

New sound modes, improved mouse handling, improved video modes, OpenGL
glows and more.
