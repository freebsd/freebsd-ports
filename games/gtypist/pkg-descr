GNU typist is a typing tutor package built using curses(3).  The
package contains a number of tutorials, drills and practise sessions
to help with mastering touch typing on the standard computer keyboard.
The accent is on the US keyboard layout, but the lessons may also
be useful with other layouts.  A Dvorak and a Spanish lesson set
are included.
