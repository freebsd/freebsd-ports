The idea of dopewars is to deal drugs on the streets of New York,
amassing a huge fortune and paying off the loan shark, while avoiding
the ever-annoying police.  The UNIX rewrite, as well as featuring a
so-called "antique" mode which closely follows the original,
introduces new features such as the ability to take part in
multi-player games.
