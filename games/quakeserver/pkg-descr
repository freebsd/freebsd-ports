	Ok, this one definitely falls into the "I had some time one Sunday
afternoon..." category.
	This port allows you to host Quake network games on a FreeBSD machine.
	This installs the v1.01 shareware version of Quake, and the required
files to automate a server.  If you have purchased the registered version of
Quake and wish to host a registered server, take the files from the ID1/
subdirectory of your installed version of Quake, and put them into
/usr/local/quakeserver/id1.  Be sure to make the filenames lowercase.
	Note:  I'm not sure how this will work with the v1.06 version of
registered quake.  Currently, I can't get the intel loader to work with the 1.06
game files, so I'm not optimistic.  YMMV.
	Credits to iD for creating a great game, and to Dan Nelson
<dnelson@emsphone.com> for creating the expect script that wraps around the
server in case it crashes.
	Note that this port can technically be used to play Quake under X, but I
don't recommend it.  It's slow, small, and prone to crashing.  If you want to
host a very fast and responsive Quake game, use this.  If you want to play it,
run DOS.
	Shameless plug:  I've also ported qcc, the QuakeC compiler to let server
ops make their own quake games.  You do need registered Quake to do this, but
it's well worth it.  Look for qcc in the games collection of FreeBSD's ports
repository.
