Notes
-----
 Good idea to restrict file names to 20 chars.

 The editor tries to fill the entire screen - so if you write a level on
 a big screen, you will not be able to play it on a small one.  And
 remember to save the game you are editing before exiting.

 Probably contains bugs - but if I knew what they were they would not be
 there ...

Thanks

 A big THANK YOU goes to Joey Hess (jeh22@conell.edu) who contributed
 the pyramid level, wrote the man pages for the game and pointed out a
 couple of minor bugs.
