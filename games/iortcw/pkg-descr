Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a military- and occult-themed
first-person shooter game in a Second World War setting, originally
released in 2001.  It is a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D.

This port contains the iortcw game engines for the single-player
campaign and multiplayer, based on ioquake3 and the GPL source
releases of RtCW.

Return to Castle Wolfenstein requires non-distributable game data
files, which you have to install manually (see pkg-message).
