The goal of the game is to reach the highest possible score. You get a limited
number of pipes on each level and need to combine them to lead the water from
the house at the top of the screen to the storage tank at the bottom. For each
pipe water goes through, you get 20 points and if you fill the cross-pipe both
ways, you get 60 points. At end of each level, you are awarded depending on the
skill level:

  * Beginner: 100 points
  * Toolman: 100 points + number of pipes remaining
  * Master plumber: 100 points + 2 x number of pipes remaining

Some of the levels also have obstacles where you cannot place pipes. The game
is playable with joystick/joypad: just move it and press buttons when you go to
Options -> Configure controls
