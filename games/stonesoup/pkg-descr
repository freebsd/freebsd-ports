Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a fun, free rogue-like game of exploration and 
treasure-hunting in dungeons filled with dangerous and unfriendly monsters 
in a quest for the mystifyingly fabulous Orb of Zot.

Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a variant of Linley's Dungeon Crawl that's openly 
developed and invites participation from the Crawl community.
