Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a fun, free rogue-like game of exploration and
treasure-hunting in dungeons filled with dangerous and unfriendly monsters
in a quest for the mystifyingly fabulous Orb of Zot.

Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a variant of Linley's Dungeon Crawl that's openly
developed and invites participation from the Crawl community.

This port comes with two interfaces:

    games/stonesoup - the traditional tty interfaced
    games/stonesoup-sdl - the fancy SDL interface
