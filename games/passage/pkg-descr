Passage is meant to be a memento mori game. It presents an entire
life, from young adulthood through old age and death, in the span
of five minutes. Of course, it's a game, not a painting or a film,
so the choices that you make as the player are crucial. There's no
"right" way to play Passage, just as there's no right way to interpret
it.
