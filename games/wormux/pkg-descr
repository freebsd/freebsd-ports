Almost everyone has heard of the Worms(R) series of games, developed by Team17.
Worms was created in 1990, the goal of the game consisting of a several teams of
"worms" fighting to the death on a 2D map. Wormux is heavily influenced by all
games in this genre, including Scorched Earth and Liero.

Wormux is free software clone of this game concept. Though currently under heavy
development, it is already very playable, with lots of weapons (Dynamite,
Baseball Bat, Teleportation, etc.). There are also lots of maps available for
your battling pleasure! Wormux takes the genre to the next level, with great
customisation options leading to great gameplay. There is a wide selection of
teams, from the Aliens to the Chickens. Also, new battlefields can be downloaded
from the Internet, making strategy an important part of each battle.
