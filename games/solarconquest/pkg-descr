An expedition to another solar system was supposed to be the biggest event in
mankind's history. While it achieved such glory, it also caused a corrupt
Admrial to gain new territory.

You are part of a small rebel force. Your task is to keep Admrial Moretti's
forces at bay, until the Earth Space Forces can send a rescue team.

Solar Conquest is a 2D action game that takes place in space. You pilot a
fighter and fight alongside dozens of allies. Battles can range from just a
dozen a team, or up to all out war with hundreds of ships per team.
