3D arcade with unique fighting system and anthropomorphic characters.

Lugaru's primary feature is its unique combat system. Instead of relying
on confusing button combinations to perform moves, Lugaru's moves are all
logical and context sensitive. For example, if an opponent aims a roundhouse
kick at Turner's head, you can crouch and then stand up under the attack to
grab your assailant's leg and kick him away. If you try and punch an opponent
and he tries to throw you over his shoulder, you can crouch to roll painlessly
out of the throw. This new combat system makes fights look and feel much more
intense and believable than in any other game. You can see it in action with
the gameplay movies above.
