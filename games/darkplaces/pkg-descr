Dark Places is a Quake modification I have built over the course of 6 years on
and off experimenting, it got somewhat of an overhaul when the Quake engine
source code was released, and I began developing a custom OpenGL-only engine
for it and other mods, which supports Windows WGL and Linux GLX, and has
greatly improved graphics and image quality.

It can not easily be described, as it is simply an improved Quake, not a total
conversion (yet, anyway).

The realism of shell casings falling to the floor, much improved bullet
impacts, 32bit color alpha blended explosions, blood flying everywhere and
sticking to the walls...

Behind the scenes the code has changed a great deal, I was not content with
the original QuakeC code, and I have greatly changed the engine while
maintaining compatibility with normal Quake modifications.
