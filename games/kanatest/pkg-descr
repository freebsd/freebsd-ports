During test the Kanatest displays randomly selected kana char
(respecting mode and lesson) and waits for user answer expected as
romaji equivalent. This process continues until all questions will be
answered or all questions will be answered correctly (depends on
options). At the end of test a short info about drilling time and
correctness ratio is displayed. The results are stored and user can
review his performance in any time.
