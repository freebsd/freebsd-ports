======================================================================
This game will attempt to obtain some system information by
accessing files in linux's procfs. You must install the Linux
emulation procfs filesystem for this to work correctly. This can be
accomplished by adding the following line to your /etc/fstab file:

 linprocfs   /compat/linux/proc   linprocfs   rw   0  0

and then, as root, executing the commands:

kldload linprocfs
mount /compat/linux/proc
