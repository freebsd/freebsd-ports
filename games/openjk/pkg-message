OpenJK requires the original game files from Star Wars: Jedi Knight:
Jedi Academy to work properly.  These can come from an original CD or
from GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_star_wars_jedi_knight_-_jedi_academy_1.01_(a)_(10331)_(g).exe
using the innoextract package.

The files will be in a directory named app. Inside the app directory,
there is a GameData directory. Inside the GameData directory, there is
a directory named base. This base directory must be moved to
~/.local/share/openjk

The easiest way to do this is to follow these steps:
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/openjk
$ innoextract setup_star_wars_jedi_knight_-_jedi_academy_1.01_(a)_(10331)_(g).exe
$ cd app/GameData
$ cp -R base ~/.local/share/openjk

You can then delete everything else that is extracted from the exe,
such as the tmp directory.

The multiplayer game binary is jamp and the single player game binary
is jasp.

If you own a copy of Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Outcast, its game
files may be used to play that game, though upstream makes no
guarantees on your success in playing this game.
