In the Untahris Common Playground, you can play several classic fun, simple
arcade games. But playing alone is not fun, and you can play them in multiplayer
mode (on one computer, local network, or maybe Internet).

Now, Untahris has an original experimental feature, which makes it more than
just a bundle of these games! In multiplayer mode each player can play a
different game --- however, they play all on the same board. This may lead to
funny interactions, battles or alliances between them.

The games in Untahris have been modified to make them better interact with each
other. Thus, in each game you are allowed to shoot and collect bonuses, even if
it was not a part of the original game.
