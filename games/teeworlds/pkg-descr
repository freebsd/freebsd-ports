Teeworlds is a freeware online multiplayer game, designed as a
crossover between Quake and Worms. Set on platform-based maps,
players control a cute little bugger with guns to take out as many
opponents as possible. The characters can jump but move more quickly
using a grappling hook, swinging through the levels. It can also
be used to lock other players to keep them near. The available
weapons include a pistol, shotgun, grenade launcher and a hammer.
The shooting and grappling direction is shown through a cursor,
controlled by the mouse. A special power-up temporarily provides a
ninja sword, used to slash through enemies. Each character has an
amount of health and shield. Items scattered around include additional
ammo, and health and shield bonuses. Unlike Worms, all the action
that happens is fast-paced and happens in real-time. It supports
CTF mode.
