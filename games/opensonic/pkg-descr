Game based on the "Sonic the Hedgehog" universe.
It introduces a different style of gameplay called cooperative play,
in which it's possible to control 3 characters simultaneously.
Unlike most similar games, Open Sonic provides a greater level of interaction
between the player and the levels. It's more than just a jump'n'run;
the user must come up with some strategy in order to get through the levels.
