Installation successful: now you can try to launch it typing "glob2".

Anyway, it will not always work, so it is suggested that you type
"glob2 --help" and read about command lines arguments.

Try to use -G option if you have problems with dri and glx (OpenGL),
or -m if you have problems with sound.
