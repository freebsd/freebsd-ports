Childsplay is a 'suite' of educational games for young children, like gcompris,
but without the overkill of c/c++ and the gnome environ.:-) Also the use of the
SDL libraries makes smooth animation and the playing of sound very easy.
Childsplay uses a plugin system for the games, so you might want to check the
childsplay-plugins page.  (There are two built-in games; Memory and a typing
game)

Childsplay and the games are GNU-GPL licensed and are tested on GNU/Linux and
the Windows platforms. (and now, FreeBSD)
