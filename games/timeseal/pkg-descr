timeseal is a program that has been developed to improve chess on internet.
Netlag often causes players to lose valuable seconds or even minutes on their
chess clocks. Transmission time is counted against you, unless the chess
server can tell exactly when information is transmitted. The timeseal program
acts as a relay station and keeps track of transmission times. What timeseal
does is record your thinking time, so that transmission time is not counted
against you. Timeseal will not prevent netlag but it makes the games fairer
when lag occurs.
