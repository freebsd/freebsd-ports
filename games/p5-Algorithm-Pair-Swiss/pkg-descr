This module was created as an alternative for Algorithm::Pair::Best, which
probably offers more control over the pairings, in particular regarding
ensuring the highest overal quality of pairings. Algorithm::Pair::Swiss is
sort of dumb in this regard, but uses a slightly more intuitive interface
and an algorithm that should perform noticably faster. The module was
primarily designed based on the Swiss rounds system used for Magic: The
Gathering tournaments.
