FreeBSD graphics console (VGL) version of the famous Digger game.

HISTORY
-------
Digger was originally created by Windmill software in 1983 and released as
a copy-protected, bootable 5.25" floppy disk for the IBM PC/XT. As it
requires a genuine CGA card, it didn't work on modern PCs. In 1998 a new
version was created by Andrew Jenner which runs on all PCs with CGA or
better and, whilst retaining all the atmosphere and playability of the
original, has many new features.

In 2000 it was ported to several Unix-like architectures by Maxim Sobolev.
Currently it supports FreeBSD, using either VGL or SDL library, and Linux using
SDL library.
