KLines is a simple but highly addictive one player game.  The player
has to move the colored balls around the game board, gathering them
into the lines of the same color by five.  Once the line is complete
it is removed from the board, therefore freeing precious space.  In
the same time the new balls keep arriving by three after each move,
filling up the game board.
