Throw away Doom, Quake and Duke Nukem - 0verkill comes. Now you don't even need
graphic mode if you wanna take on your friends in a bloody deathmatch. 

Finally you can taste elaborate shoot-em-up action in 16 glorious colors on
your plain old text terminal. You never thought that ASCII letters are capable
of network-game action in such a massive manner. 

No one ever connected gushing blood with those innocent ASCII letters that were
so utterly boring until recently, when 0verkill was released.
