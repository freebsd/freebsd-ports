FrikQCC was started few months before the Quake engine source was released.
Originally based off of FastQCC, it was widely (well, among the people at
MDQNet) enjoyed for a few months.  After J. P. Grossman released QCCX, back
in March 2000, many of its features and ideas found their way into FrikQCC.
The result was FrikQCC 2.0, which has been updated many times since then.

It currently supports: goto, labels, static variables, new optimizations,
compiler warnings, and many other features.
