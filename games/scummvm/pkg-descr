ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical
adventure and role-playing games, provided you already have their data files.

The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with
the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never
designed!  ScummVM is a complete rewrite of these games' executables and is not
an emulator.

ScummVM supports a huge library of adventures with over 250 games in total.

It supports many classics published by legendary studios like LucasArts,
Sierra On-Line, Revolution Software, Cyan, Inc. and Westwood Studios.  Next to
ground-breaking titles like the Monkey Island series, Broken Sword, Myst,
Blade Runner and countless other games you will find some really obscure
adventures and truly hidden gems to explore.
