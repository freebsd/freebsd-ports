A game for Unix/X11 by Holger Schemel, (c) 1995-99 by Holger Schemel.

This is a nice little game with color graphics and sound for your Unix system
with color X11.  You need an 8-Bit color display or better.  It will not work
on black&white systems, and maybe not on gray scale systems.

If you know the game "Boulderdash" (Commodore C64) or "Emerald Mine" (Amiga),
you know what "ROCKS'N'DIAMONDS" is about.
