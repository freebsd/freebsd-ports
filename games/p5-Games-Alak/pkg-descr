This module implements a simple game-tree system for the computer to
play against the user in a game of Alak. You can just play the game
for fun; or you can use this module as a starting point for
understanding game trees (and implementing smarter strategy -- the
module's current logic is fairly simple-minded), particularly after
reading my Perl Journal #18 article on trees, which discusses this
module's implementation of game trees as an example of general
tree-shaped data structures.
