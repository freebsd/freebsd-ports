Virtual Jay Peak is a simulation of snowboarding at the Jay Peak
resort in Vermont. The terrain is based on geological survey data of
the mountain and surrounding area, with the addition of signature
trails and buildings. The software is based on the extreme backcountry
snowboarding game Soul Ride.
