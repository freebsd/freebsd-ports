Moonlight allows you to stream your Desktop or games from your Windows
PC(sunshine or NV shield) to your FreeBSD system.

In contrast to moonlight-qt, this port can grab keyboard and mouse
and has full worked vaapi decoder, which helps in case of crashes.

Note: This is a fork of moonlight-embedded aimed for more features
and fixes for FreeBSD on amd64, not only on embedded systems.
