xjump is set to use /var/games/xjump.record for its scorekeeping.
However, due to security concerns, xjump is not installed setgid
games, and thus cannot write this file.  In order to enable keeping
scores, you will need to run these commands:

	1) touch /var/games/xjump.record
	2) chmod 664 /var/games/xjump.record
	3) chmod 2755 ${PREFIX}/bin/xjump

where ${PREFIX} is the prefix that xjump was installed under,
which is usually /usr/X11R6.
