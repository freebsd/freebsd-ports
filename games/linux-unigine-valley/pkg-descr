Valley Benchmark is a new GPU stress-testing tool from the developers
of the very popular and highly acclaimed Heaven Benchmark. The
forest-covered valley surrounded by vast mountains amazes with its
scale from a bird's-eye view and is extremely detailed down to every
leaf and flower petal. This non-synthetic benchmark powered by the
state-of-the art UNIGINE Engine showcases a comprehensive set of
cutting-edge graphics technologies with a dynamic environment and
fully interactive modes available to the end user.

This port includes the linux-binaries of the basic (free-to-use)
version of the benchmark.
