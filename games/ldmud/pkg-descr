LDMud started as a project to clean up and modernize Amylaar's LPMud
gamedriver. Primary goals are full documentation, a commented source
body and out-of-the-box support for the major mudlibs, of which the
commented source body has been pretty much completed. During the
course of work a lot of bug fixes and improvements found their way
into the driver - much more than originally expected, and definitely
enough to make LDMud a driver in its own right.
