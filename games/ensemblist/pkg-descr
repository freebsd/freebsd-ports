Ensemblist is a unique reflexion game created for the video game coding
compo held in March 2003 in Paris.
In this game, you have to put together several simple geometric
primitives to build a given shape. For this, you can move, rotate and
compose the primitives with the boolean operators union, intersection
and minus. This is building what is called a C.S.G, for Constructive
Solid Geometry.
