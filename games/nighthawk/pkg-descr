Nighthawk is a shoot-'em up which requires thinking more than
reflexes. Your goal is to destroy droids occupying a fleet of
reclaimed starships. You start out as a 002 Paradroid with very poor
firepower and shielding but have the ability to transfer your programs
over to a new droid, effectively taking it over. As you take control
of bigger and better droids, you gain better firepower and shielding.
