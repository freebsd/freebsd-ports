miniCHESS, or as I've christened it in this port, wmminichess,
is a rather interesting dockapp that puts the power of gnuchess
in a windowmaker dockapp.

However, be warned:

	miniCHESS was born out of boredom.  I warn you... if your a chess
enthusiast and play a lot then please use xboard or some other chess
gui.  Even though miniCHESS has that kinda cool factor, it does get hard
on the eyes.  I like using miniCHESS for games in which I'm in no hurry
to finish and go on for a couple days.  Sorry but miniCHESS has no
save/restore features yet.

The README in /usr/X11R6/share/wmminichess/ should explain how to
play. It really does a nice job of that.
