Imagine you are skiing down an infinite slope, facing such hazards as
trees, ice, bare ground, and the man-eating Yeti! Unfortunately, you have
put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you can't see ahead where you
are going; only behind where you have been. However, you can turn to
either side, jump or hop through the air, teleport through hyperspace,
launch nuclear ICBMs, and cast spells to call the Fire Demon. And since
the hazards occur in patches, you can skillfully outmaneuver them. A fun
and very silly game that proves you don't need fancy graphical user
interfaces to have a good time.
