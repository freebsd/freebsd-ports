Kobo Deluxe is an enhanced version of Akira Higuchi's game XKobo. It adds
sound, smoother animation, high resolution support, OpenGL acceleration
(optional), an intuitive menu driven user interface, joystick support and
other features. Kobo Deluxe uses SDL for graphics, sound and input, which
makes it possible to run the game on pretty much anything.
