To play a game copy its .pak file under ~/.%%PKGBASE%%/Paks/ directory.
If only one file is there OpenBOR would run the game on startup,
otherwise game launcher would appear.

In case a game has data/ directory unpacked you may need to run it
as follows:

  $ cd /path/to/game
  $ cp -R ~/.%%PKGBASE%%/Saves .
  $ OPENBOR_USE_CURDIR=1 %%PKGBASE%%
