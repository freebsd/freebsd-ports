======================================================================

If the game is installed with movie support (NWMovies), there is a way
to skip various movies, especially the five introduction movies at the
start of the game:  create a skip file ($HOME/.nwn/nwmovies.skip) and
list the movies (case-insensitive) you wish to skip.  The following
are the introduction movies, at least in the Diamond edition:
AtariLogo
BiowareLogo
WotcLogo
fge_logo_black
NWNIntro

There is a known issue due to the use of NWMovies.  As written in
the NWMovies README file:

    The main menu music does not work after starting NWN w/ NWMovies.
    Entering the game, and backing out to the main menu, the music
    works.  Known issue, no known cause, nor resolution.
