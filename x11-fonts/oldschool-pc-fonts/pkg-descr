The Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack started out with the idea of paying tribute
to ancient PCs and their bitmapped, pre-GUI typography (if you can call it
that). It was inspired by similar efforts that cover other vintage machines:
classic system fonts from the Amiga, C64, Apple II, Mac, ZX Spectrum,
Atari 8-bit/ST etc. are all celebrated. On the other hand, the IBM PC and its
clones seem to get little love... except for that one VGA text mode font
(which has been remade numerous times, to varying degrees of success).

This collection is here to remedy that, and to bring you pixel-perfect remakes
of various type styles from text-mode era PCs - in modern, multi-platform,
Unicode-compatible TrueType form (plus straight bitmap versions).

Although the goal is to make it a complete resource, the main focus is on
hardware character sets: the kind that's located in a ROM chip on the system
board or graphics card, which is what you'd see by default when working in
text (or graphics) mode. Software-loadable fonts are also within the scope of
this collection (if associated with a particular machine or display system),
so some of these have also made it in.
