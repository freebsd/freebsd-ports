Defcon is a set of UFO based objects optimized for use in font editing
applications. The objects are built to be lightweight, fast and flexible.
The objects are very bare-bones and they are not meant to be end-all, be-all
objects. Rather, they are meant to provide base functionality so that you can
focus on your application's behavior, not object observing or maintaining
cached data.
