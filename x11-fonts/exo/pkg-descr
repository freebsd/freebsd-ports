Exo 2 is a complete redrawing of Exo, a contemporary geometric sans serif
typeface that tries to convey a technological/futuristic feeling while keeping
an elegant design. Exo is a very versatile font, so it has 9 weights
(the maximum on the web) and each with a true italic version. Exo 2 has a more
organic look that will perform much better at small text sizes and in long texts.
