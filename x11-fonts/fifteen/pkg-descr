Fifteen is a faux bitmap font. This font is designed to be used as a monotype
font for use in a terminal, or at a larger size, to look like an over scaled
bitmap. It works well in a 132 column terminal window. It is, of course,
monospaced and has clearly distinct 1I and l, and the zero is slashed.

Quinze is a narrow monospaced font, for programming and terminal emulators. It
is designed to be narrow, and allow 132 columns to be comfortably fitted on a
screen The 1, l and I are clearly distinguished, as are O and 0. The ascii
circumflex is presented as an arrow, consistent with its use as exponentiation
operator.
