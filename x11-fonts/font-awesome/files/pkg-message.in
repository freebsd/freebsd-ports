Make sure that the freetype module is loaded.  If it is not, add the following
line to the "Modules" section of your X Windows configuration file:

        Load "freetype"

Add the following line to the "Files" section of X Windows configuration file:

        FontPath "%%FONTSDIR%%/"

If you're upgrading from Font Awesome v4, you may need to update your configs
to the new font families "Font Awesome 5 Free" and "Font Awesome 5 Free Solid".
