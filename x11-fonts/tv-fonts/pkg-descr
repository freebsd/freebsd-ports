This package contains a number of fonts which are useful for TV applications:

led-fixed
    This is the big font which xawtv uses by default for the onscreen display
    in fullscreen mode.
ets-teletext
    This is a teletext font. It contains the block graphic characters used by
    teletext pages. When watching teletext with the mtt teletext browser you'll
    get much better results with these fonts installed.
ets-caption
    A font for closed captions.
