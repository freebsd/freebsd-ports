You'll have to add %%FONTSDIR%%
to your X font path by either:

$ xset fp+ %%FONTSDIR%%
$ xset fp rehash

or by adding it to your X-server configuration file and
restarting the X-server.

NOTE: These fonts are SHAREWARE. You must pay a fee if you
find that you are using them a lot. Please read the
*.shareware files in %%FONTSDIR%%
for each font's licensing restrictions.
