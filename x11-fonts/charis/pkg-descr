Charis SIL is a Unicode-based font family that attempts to provide a
comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any Roman- or
Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or orthographic
needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and symbols useful
to linguists. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font technologies to
support complex typographic issues, such as the need to position arbitrary
combinations of base glyphs and diacritics optimally.

Charis is similar to Bitstream Charter, one of the first fonts designed
specifically for laser printers. It is highly readable and holds up well in
less-than-ideal reproduction environments. It also has a full set of styles
- regular, italic, bold, bold italic - and so is more useful in general
publishing than Doulos SIL. Charis is a serif, proportionally-spaced font
optimized for readability in long printed documents.
