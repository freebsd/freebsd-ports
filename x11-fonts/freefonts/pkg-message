============================================================
You'll have to add /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/freefont
to your X font path by either:

$ xset fp+ /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts/freefont
$ xset fp rehash

or by adding it to your X-server configuration file (usually
/etc/X11/XF86Config) and restarting the X-server.
