The Droid typeface family was designed in the fall of 2006 by Ascender's
Steve Matteson, as a commission from Google to create a set of system fonts
for its Android platform. The goal was to provide optimal quality and
comfort on a mobile handset when rendered in application menus, web
browser and for other screen text.
