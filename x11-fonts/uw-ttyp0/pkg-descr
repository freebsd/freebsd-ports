UW ttyp0 is a family of bitmap screen fonts in bdf format. It covers most of
the Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, Greek, Armenian, Georgian (only Mkhedruli),
Hebrew (without cantillation marks), Thai, most of IPA (but no UPA), standard
punctuation, common symbols, some mathematics, line graphics, a few dingbats,
and Powerline delimiter symbols. In addition to Unicode (ISO 10646-1), UW ttyp0
supports about thirty 8-bit encodings (code pages).

UW ttyp0 comes in nine sizes from 6x11 to 11x22. In all of the sizes there are
regular and bold versions; for some there is also an italic.
