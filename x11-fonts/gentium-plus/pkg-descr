Gentium is a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic
groups around the world who use the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts
to produce readable, high-quality publications. It supports a wide
range of Latin- and Cyrillic-based alphabets.

The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and
visually attractive. The Latin letters are designed to naturally
harmonize with the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated with
careful thought and attention to their use. Gentium also supports both
polytonic and monotonic Greek. Gentium Plus now includes more extended
Latin glyphs (Unicode 5.1), archaic Greek symbols, and full extended
Cyrillic script support
