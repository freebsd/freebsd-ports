Gentium is a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic
groups around the world who use the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts
to produce readable, high-quality publications. It supports a wide
range of Latin- and Cyrillic-based alphabets.

Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic are font families based on the
original Gentium design, but with additional weights. The "Book"
family is slightly heavier. Both families come with a complete
regular, bold, italic and bold italic set of fonts.
