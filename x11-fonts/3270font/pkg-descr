This font is derived from the x3270 font, which, in turn, was translated
from the one in Georgia Tech's 3270tool, which was itself hand-copied
from a 3270 series terminal. This font was built because the author felt
that terminals deserve to be pretty. The .sfd font file contains a x3270
bitmap font that was used for guidance.
