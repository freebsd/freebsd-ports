Vollkorn, the free and healthy typeface for bread and butter use, designed by
Friedrich Althausen.

It intends to be a quiet, modest and well working text face for bread and
butter use. Unlike its examples in the book faces from the renaissance until
today, it has dark and meaty serifs and a bouncing and healthy look. It might
be used as body type as well as for headlines or titles.
