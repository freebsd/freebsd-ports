The Wen Quan Yi bitmap font includes complete CJK Unified 
Ideograph (U4E00 - U9FA5) glyphs at four different sizes 
(9pt-12X12 pixel, 10pt-13X13 pixel, 11pt-15X15 pixel, 
12pt-16x16 pixel) and two weights (medium and bold). 
Use of this bitmap font for on-screen display of Chinese 
(traditional and simplified) in web pages and elsewhere 
eliminates the annoying "blurring" problems caused by 
the high stroke density of many Chinese characters and 
insufficient "hinting" of anti-aliased Chinese fonts. 
This font also provides bitmap glyphs for Japanese 
Hiragana (U3040 - U309F), Katakana (U30A0 - U30FF) 
and for Korean Hangul (UAC00 - UD7A3).
