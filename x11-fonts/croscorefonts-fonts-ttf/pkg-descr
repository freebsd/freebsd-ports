Google has created a set of fonts for its ChromeOS Operating system.

The three standard ones closely mimic the most popular ones for the Windows
platform and Linux's so-called Liberation fonts but are available under an
OpenFont license.

Tinos, Arimo and Cousine, appear to be variations of the old standard Times,
Arial and Courier.
