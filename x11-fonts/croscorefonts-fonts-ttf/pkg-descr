Google has created a set of fonts for it's ChromeOS Operating system.

The three standard ones closely  mimic the most popular ones for
the Windows platform and the linuxso-called Liberation fonts but
are available under an OpenFont license. 

Tinos, Arimo and Cousine, appear to be variations of the old
standard  Times, Arial and Courier.
