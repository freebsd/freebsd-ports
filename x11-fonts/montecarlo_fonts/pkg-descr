MonteCarlo is a bitmap font suitable for code editors. All the characters
have the same width, which is ideal for alignment. It is loosely derived
from the look of the Monaco screen font that was available on the old MacOS
systems. Some changes have been made to make it easier to differentiate
certain symbols.
