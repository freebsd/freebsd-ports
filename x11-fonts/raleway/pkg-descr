Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface, designed in a single
thin weight.  It is a display face that features both old style and
lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty
complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired
by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than it's neo-grotesque
inspired default character set.
