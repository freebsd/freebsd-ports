CYR-RFX started as a collection of cyrillic fonts for X-Window
("CYR-RFX" stands for "CYRillic Raster Fonts for X"). Now it includes
several cyrillic encodings and two latin ones (both with Euro sign).

These fonts are modified (mainly with cyrillics added) versions of
standard X-Window fonts from misc/ and 75dpi/.

The fonts included are all *iso8859-1 from misc/, and most important
75dpi/ ones: lu (LucidaSans), lut (LucidaSansTypewriter), tim (Times),
helv (Helvetica) and cour (Courier).

Unlike the standard CYR-RFX' hierarchical install, this port installs
all fonts for the same encoding into a single directory, with combined
fonts.aliases and the new fonts.dir. The default encoding is KOI8-O --
seemingly the most complete of the Cyrillic encodings, compatible (for
most intents and purposes) with KOI8-R and KOI8-U.
