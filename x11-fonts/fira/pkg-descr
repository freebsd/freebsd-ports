Originally designed as a typeface for the Mozilla OS, Fira Sans has
developed towards a standalone Open Source project.  Over the last years,
Fira covered more and more languages and provided further weights and
styles.

In version 4.2 the Fira Sans Family comprises 16 weights in 2 styles Roman
and Italic.  And Fira grew even more.  We added a Condensed, Condensed
Roman, plus a Compressed and Compressed Italic.  All fonts of Fira Sans
contain more than 2600 glyphs each.

Fira Mono is still in progress.  Though, it covers almost 1500 glyphs and
comes in three weights.
