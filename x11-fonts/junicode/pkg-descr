Junicode is an advanced Unicode font for medieval scholars, including the
full range of characters for languages written in the Latin script. It
also partially implements the recommendation of the Medieval Unicode Font
Initiative (MUFI).

The following languages are fully supported: Old and Middle English, Old
Icelandic, Runic, Latin, Gothic and Sanskrit transliterations, IPA
(International Phonetic Alphabet) and Greek (based on the Greek Double
Pica cut by Alexander Wilson of Glasgow in the eighteenth century).

Junicode supports the following OpenType features: f and long-s ligatures,
contextual alternates (calt), horizontal kerning (kern), discretionary
ligatures (circled numbers and letters via dlig), glyph (de)composition
(ccmp), correct positioning of combining marks -- mark-to-base (mark) and
mark-to-mark (mkmk), small caps (smcp and c2sc), old-style figures (onum),
super- and subscript numbers (sups and subs) and Unicode fractions (frac).

Junicode's OpenType style sets provide support for Nordic and Insular
letter-forms, Old English typography, enlarged minuscules, swash letters
and MUFI's overlined characters and historic ligatures.
