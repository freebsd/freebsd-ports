To use these fonts, add the following line to the "Files" section of
xorg.conf:

	FontPath "%%DIR%%/"

Users of older versions of X may additionally have to make sure that
the freetype module is loaded.  Check /var/log/Xorg.0.log for error
messages.  If freetype is required, add the following line to the
"Modules" section of xorg.conf:

	Load "freetype"
