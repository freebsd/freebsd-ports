Alegreya is a typeface originally intended for literature. Among its crowning
characteristics, it conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the
reading of long texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring
to the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in a
contemporary typographic language.
