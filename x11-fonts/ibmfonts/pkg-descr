A collection of monospaced, bitmap fonts in BDF format that origin from IBM
text mode and system fonts. They include extended latin, greek, cyrillic and
hebrew scripts and several extra characters, for a total of 750 glyphs each.
The fonts are in BDF 2.1 format and fully compatible with applications that
make use of either Xft or XLFD.

This is a format conversion of some of the bitmap fonts available from the
x11-fonts/oldschool-pc-fonts package. The BDF (compiled to PCF) format might
work better with applications that can use X Toolkit fonts, notably x11/xterm.
