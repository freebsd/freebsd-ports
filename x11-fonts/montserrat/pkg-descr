The old posters and signs in the traditional neighborhood of Buenos Aires
called Montserrat inspired the design of a typeface that rescues the beauty of
urban typography from the first half of the twentieth century. The goal is to
rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free, under a free, libre and open
source license, the SIL Open Font License.
