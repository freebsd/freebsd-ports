The MgOpen typefaces are freely available and contain glyphs for viewing
texts in Greek (written in the monotoniko system).

The MgOpen typeface collection is composed of the following typefaces:

  - MgOpenCanonica is a serif typeface, based on the design of Times Roman.
  - MgOpenCosmetica is a sans-serif typeface, based on the design of Optima.
  - MgOpenModata is another sans-serif typeface.
  - MgOpenModerna is a sans-serif typeface, based on the design of Helvetica.

Each family contains four fonts, namely all the combinations of regular and
bold weight and upright and italic (or oblique) shape. All the fonts contain
glyphs for the latin and greek alphabets (using the monotoniko system), while
the fonts of the Canonica family also contain all the glyphs necessary for
viewing Greek texts written in the polytoniko system. All the fonts use the
Unicode encoding for characters and are in the TrueType format.

The fonts, in their initial release, have some characters missing (the most
important one being the Euro symbol). These shortcomings will be fixed in
future releases.
