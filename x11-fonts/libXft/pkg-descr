The current version of Xft provides a client-side font API for X
applications. It uses Fontconfig to select fonts and the X protocol for
rendering them. When available, Xft uses the Render extension to accelerate
text drawing. When Render is not available, Xft uses the core protocol to draw
client-side glyphs. This provides completely compatible support of client-side
fonts for all X servers.
