The proggy programmer's fonts (Proggy Clean, Proggy Square, Proggy Small,
and Proggy Tiny) are a set of fixed-width screen fonts that are designed
for code listings. Each font only comes in one size that it looks good at.
The fonts were optimized while coding in C or C++. For this reason,
characters like the '*' were placed vertically centered, as '*' usually
means dereference or multiply, but never 'to the power of' like in Fortran.
The {}s are centered horizontally (as the author's coding style aligns
braces vertically), the zero looks different from the capital oh, and there
is never any confusion between ells, ones, and eyes. Additionally, the
arithmetic operators (+ - * < >) are all axis aligned.
