Source Code Pro was designed by Paul D. Hunt as a companion to Source Sans.
This complementary family was adapted from the Source design due to a
request to create a monospaced version for coding applications.

Source Code Pro currently supports a wide range of languages using Latin
script, and includes all the characters in the Adobe Latin 4 glyph set. As
an open source project, it is expected that incremental updates will be
made over time to extend glyph set coverage and functionality.
