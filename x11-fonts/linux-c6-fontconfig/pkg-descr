This is a Linux/i386 binary port of the Fontconfig library and utilities.

In the words of its author, Keith Packard:

   Fontconfig can:
     * discover new fonts when installed automatically, removing a common
       source of configuration problems.
     * perform font name substitution, so that appropriate alternative
       fonts can be selected if fonts are missing.
     * identify the set of fonts required to completely cover a set of
       languages.
     * have GUI configuration tools built as it uses an XML-based
       configuration file (though with autodiscovery, we believe this need
       is minimized).
     * efficiently and quickly find the fonts you need among the set of
       fonts you have installed, even if you have installed thousands of
       fonts, while minimzing memory usage.
     * be used in concert with the X Render Extension and FreeType to
       implement high quality, anti-aliased and subpixel rendered text on a
       display.
