Font Manager is not intended to be a professional-grade font management
solution, but rather a simple application suitable for the needs of most
desktop users.

Although designed with the GNOME desktop environment in mind, it should
work well with most major desktop environments such as Xfce, Enlightenment,
and even KDE.
