Font Manager is not intended to be a professional-grade
font management solution, but rather a simple application
suitable for the needs of most desktop users.

Although designed with the GNOME desktop environment in mind,
it should work well with most major desktop environments such
as Xfce, Enlightenment, and even KDE.
