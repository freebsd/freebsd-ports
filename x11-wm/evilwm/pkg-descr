evilwm is a minimalist window manager for X11.  The name evil came from
Stuart "Stuii" Ford, who reckons any window manager I use has to be evil
and masochistic.  This is not the case at all, but I liked the name.

It features movement, killing, lowering, raising, and moving windows by
keyboard control.  It supports virtual desktops.
