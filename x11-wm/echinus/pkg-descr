echinus wm is a window manager for X11 supporting managing windows in
floating, tiled and maximized layouts.
All the configuration is made via config file in Xresources format.
So you don't need to recompile echinus every time you change something.
Echinus supports a small subset of EWMH to be compatible
with external panels and pagers.
It draws a border around windows and also an optional titlebar.
