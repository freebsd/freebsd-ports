E-Tiling is a tiling module the Enlightenment Window Manager.

Each desktop can have from 1 to 8 (vertical) columns. Windows are then resized
and moved to use as much as columns as configured. When there are more windows
than possible columns, the remaining windows are packed in the last column.
Resizing or moving a window will try to resize or move the column it is in.
