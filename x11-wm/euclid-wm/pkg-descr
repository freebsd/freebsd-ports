euclid-wm is a minimalist, tiling window manager for X11 that seeks to allow
easy management of numerous windows entirely from the keyboard.

euclid seeks to do two things in particular:
	- balance the ease of use common among window managers with automatic
	  or fixed layouts with the flexibility of those dynamic layouts,
	- create an easy way to manage minimized windows
