Skippy is best described as a full-screen task-switcher for X11. It tries to 
provide an alternative when taskbars or regular task-switchers aren't the most
efficient way of switching tasks (like when you have a lot of applications open)
When activated (currently only through a hotkey), it will arrange and scale 
snapshots of all windows on the current desktop and it'll let you pick a 
window using a mouse or a keyboard. Yes, this is also what expocity and Apple's
Expose.

Skippy currently works with a NETWM or GNOME WM Specs compliant window-manager.
