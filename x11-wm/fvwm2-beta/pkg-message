Notes for XFree86 3.3/3.3.1 and LANG=ja_JP.EUC:

There are some bug (?) in already released XFree86 based on X11R6.3, i.e.,
XFree86 3.3 and XFree86 3.3.1, when X client runs under LANG=ja_JP.EUC.

If you want to use this fvwm2 with LANG=ja_JP.EUC (which means "run fvwm2,
with environment variable 'LANG' is set to 'ja_JP.EUC' to enable to display
Japanese Kanji/Hiragana/Katakana characters"), apply following patch to
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/ja/XLC_LOCALE (or equivalent).
