w9wm is a quick & dirty hack based on 9wm, the wonderful "template"
window manager made by David Hogan.

9wm is really nice for all day use (I mean, a large Emacs window
covering the whole screen and a terminal to use Lynx and browse the
web ;-)) provided that you do not have a large number of windows on
your screen.  But in some occasions it is not the case (ie. you have
to telnet to 4-5 remote machines), which is painful with 9wm.

This need for virtual screens motivated this about 50 lines hack.
w9wm brings support for virtual screens (provided you use the second
button, aka middle button to select one virtual screen) as well as for
key bindings (to switch from one window to another).
