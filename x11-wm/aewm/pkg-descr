This is a minimalist window manager, partly based on 9wm,  which
implements the ICCCM.  It provides titlebars, and allows raising,
lowering, resizing, moving, and hiding or un-hiding of windows.
Placement of new windows depends on the position of the pointer.

This port installs not only the window manager, but also the aemenu
and aepanel applets.  These provide a list of windows by title
(vertically for aemenu, horizontally for aepanel) and a menu from
which programs may be run.
