Niri is a scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor. Windows are arranged
in columns on an infinite strip going to the right. Opening a new
window never causes existing windows to resize.

Features:
- Scrollable tiling
- Dynamic workspaces like in GNOME
- Built-in screenshot UI
- Monitor screencasting through xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
- Touchpad gestures
- Configurable layout: gaps, borders, struts, window sizes
- Animations
- Live-reloading config
