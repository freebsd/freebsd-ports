Oroborus is a small and simple window manager for X11 which has the
following features:

  - Good default key bindings
  - Windows are moveable by keyboard
  - Highly configurable
  - XPM-themable
  - GNOME compatible
  - NET_WM compatible
  - Sort of KDE compatible
  - And many, many more...

Oroborus doesn't provide any kind of dock, toolbar, program launcher,
background changer or root menu as these functions can be provided by
separate applications.
