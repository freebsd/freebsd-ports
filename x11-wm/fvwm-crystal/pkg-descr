This is a port of FVWM-Crystal. FVWM-Crystal aims to create an easy to use,
eye-candy but also powerful desktop environment for Linux or other Unix-like
operating systems.  It uses following programs: FVWM as a window manager and
"main core", ROX-Filer as file manager (manages icons on the desktop), xterm,
aterm, mrxvt or urxvt as terminal emulators, MPD or XMMS as music players
(there's built-in support for controlling these programs), and several other
tools for different functions, like setting a wallpaper or making screen
shots.
