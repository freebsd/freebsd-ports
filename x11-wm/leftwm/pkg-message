- If you want to see more than a black screen when you login, select a
theme.

With x11/leftwm-theme:

leftwm-theme update
leftwm-theme install NAME_OF_THEME_YOU_LIKE
leftwm-theme apply NAME_OF_THEME_YOU_LIKE

Without x11/leftwm-theme:

mkdir -p ~/.config/leftwm/themes
cd ~/.config/leftwm/themes
ln -s PATH_TO_THE_THEME_YOU_LIKE current


- LeftWM has very few dependencies, this isn't always the case for themes.
Themes typically require the following to be installed. However, this is up
to the author of the theme, and could be different.

List of common dependencies for themes:

   graphics/feh
   sysutils/conky
   x11/dmenu
   x11/hs-xmobar
   x11/polybar
   x11-wm/compton
   x11-wm/picom


- LeftWM requires that $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is set in the environment as it
uses this directory.
