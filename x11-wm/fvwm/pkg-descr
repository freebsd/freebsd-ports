Fvwm is a just another window manager for X11, which provides a simple virtual
desktop, a 3-D look for windows decorations, and shaped, color icons.
It can be configured to use far less memory than twm, or to give a very
good emulation of mwm. A nice button-bar can be used to provide convenient
access to frequently used functions or programs.
