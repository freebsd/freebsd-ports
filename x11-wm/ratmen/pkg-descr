Ratmen is a simple program for displaying a menu in a window. On selection is
may either run a program or simply write something on standard out. It is
inspired by, and is similar in function to, 9menu and ratmenu but is muchly
improved. It includes: User settings in X resources, long and short option
names (using getopts), scrollable menus (if they do not fit on screen), both
mouse and keyboard support, exiting on unfocus, and a decent manpage.
