Labwc stands for Lab Wayland Compositor, where lab can mean any of the
following:

- sense of experimentation and treading new ground
- inspired by BunsenLabs and ArchLabs
- your favorite pet

Labwc is a wlroots-based window-stacking compositor for wayland,
inspired by openbox.

It is light-weight and independent with a focus on simply stacking
windows well and rendering some window decorations. It takes a
no-bling/frills approach and says no to features such as icons (except
window buttons), animations, decorative gradients and any other
options not required to reasonably render common themes. It relies on
clients for panels, screenshots, wallpapers and so on to create a full
desktop environment.

In order to avoid reinventing configuration and theme syntax, the
openbox 3.6 specification is used. This does not mean that labwc is an
openbox clone but rather that configuration files will look and feel
familiar.
