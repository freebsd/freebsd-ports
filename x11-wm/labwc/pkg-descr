Labwc is a WIP free, wlroots-based stacking compositor for Wayland.

It has the following aims:

- Be light-weight, small and fast
- Have the look and feel of openbox albeit with a smaller feature set
- Where practicable, use clients to show wall-paper, take screenshots,
  and so on
- Stay in keeping with wlroots and sway in terms of approach and
  coding style

It is in early development, so expect bugs and missing features.
