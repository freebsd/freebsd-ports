DeforaOS desktop panel

This program is meant to display an arbitrary number of desktop panels, with
support for up to one per edge of the screen at the moment. Each panel can then
host a number of applets, implemented as plug-ins to the main program.

A number of additional utilities is also available, allowing tighter integration
of external applications, as well as when responding to system events
(notifications...).
