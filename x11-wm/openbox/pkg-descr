Openbox is a highly configurable, next generation window manager with
extensive standards support.

Openbox lets you bring the latest applications outside of a full desktop
environment.  Most modern applications have been written with GNOME and KDE
in mind.  With support for the latest freedesktop.org standards, as well as
careful adherence to previous standards, Openbox provides an environment
where applications work the way they were designed to.

Openbox is a highly configurable window manager.  It allows you to change
almost every aspect of how you interact with your desktop and invent
completely new ways to use and control it.  It can be like a video game for
controlling windows.  But Openbox can also be kept extremely simple, as it is
in the default setup, meaning that it can suit just about anybody.  Openbox
gives you control without making you do everything.

Openbox makes desktop environments better.  By running Openbox inside the
GNOME or K desktop environments, you can combine their ease and
functionality with the power of Openbox.  Your desktop becomes cleaner and
faster, and is in your control, when you use Openbox.

This port also includes optional 3rd party patches for rounder corners
support and miscellaneous fixes from
