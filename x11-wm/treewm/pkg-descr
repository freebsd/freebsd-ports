treewm is a window manager that tries to implement a new concept.  In addition
to the client windows the user can create desktops which can themselves contain
windows and desktops.  By arranging the windows in such a tree the user is able
to manage his tasks efficiently  treewm is feature-rich, flexible and provides
a powerful concept.  However, treewm's look is is rather puristic, and its feel
is not always intuitive, but with a bit of practise it should be very effective
to use.

Short feature list (some of them are quite unique among window managers):

  - Allows to create desktops and to arbitrarily move windows between desktops
  - Many options (such as sticky, autoresize, always on top, or the focus or
    raise policy) can be set for any desktop or window
  - Can be fully customized using the configuration file
  - Has a very powerful (somewhat vi-like) command mode, and can be controlled
    from shell scripts via a FIFO
  - Icons can be placed on desktops that can execute arbitrary commands
  - Only uses very common libraries, in particular it doesn't require GTK, Qt,
    or anything like that
