Fluxspace provides a framework and modules for adding event-driven behavior
to Fluxbox as an external component. A variety of features and enhancements
can be introduced more easily without modifying Fluxbox's C++ code.

Existing modules that integrate with Rox Filer or Idesk can add effective
desktop management to a pure window manager, such as Fluxbox. It goes beyond
the normal desktop capabilities to allow you to customize each workspace with
its own panels, desktop icons and running applets.
