This is ancient software that is ported for curiosity purposes.  It is
unlikely to be useful in everyday use, and should not be used in untrusted
environments as there are highly likely to be unresolved security issues.

CDE unfortunately requires a symbolic link as it uses the build system imake,
as with X11R6.  This is actually done by the dtspc rc script (and removed
afterwards).

It is also necessary to enable the Subprocess Control Service (and dtcms for
the calendar to work).

# sysrc rpcbind_enable=yes
# sysrc dtspc_enable=yes
# sysrc dtcms_enable=yes
# service rpcbind start && service dtspc start && service dtcms start

To start the Common Desktop Environment,
% ln -s /usr/dt/bin/Xsession ~/.Xsession
% env LANG=C startx
