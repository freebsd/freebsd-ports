Libcompizconfig is an alternative configuration system for
compiz and provides the following features:
	- Automatic plugin list generation.
 	- Import/Export of the current configuration.
 	- Configuration profiles.
 	- Parsing of Compiz metadata files to provide an easy to use API for
		configuration managers.
 	- Conflict handling for plugins and actions.
 	- Support for different configuration storage backends.
 	- Desktop environment integration.  If a backend provides desktop
		environment integration, then Compiz will share the keybindings
		and settings with the default desktop environment window
		manager like metacity or kwin.
 	- Its own Compiz configuration plugin "ccp" to provide all features
		of libcompizconfig with compiz.
