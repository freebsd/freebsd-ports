Window Manager Improved 2 is the next generation of the WMI project.  Due
to a complete rewrite it is highly modularized and uses a new configuration
and inter-process communication interface which is based on the 9p protocol
from the Plan 9 operating system.  It achieves following goals:

  * Reduction of compile time
  * Reduction of memory usage
  * Reduction of lines of code
  * Performance improvements
  * Improved rendering capabilities (optional Cairo)
  * Improved configuration and IPC interface (Libixp)
  * Modularized components
