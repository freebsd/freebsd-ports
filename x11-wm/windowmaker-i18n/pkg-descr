WindowMaker is a new Windowmanager for X written by Alfredo Kojima. It follows
in the tradition of Afterstep, attempting to emulate the most fantastic of
UI's posessed by the NeXT STEP(tm) operating system. It has many qualities
that make it superior to AfterStep, although it is still in development, and
does lack features. When it is completed, it will be a GNUSTEP compliant
Windowmanager that requires no editing of messy configuration files.

This port based on x11-wm/windowmaker ports skelton, enhanced i18n. 
If use first, execute "wmaker.inst" and "wsetfont you_choosed_language".
you_choosed_language is example "japanese", "korean", etc. More info about 
wsetfont, see help of wsetfont.

If you use with xdm, set your LANG enviroment variable in your .xsession.
