This module act like a taskbar for selected applications only. The purpose of
this, is having a module behaving like a tray would dock some icons. Due to the
status of the system tray specification this module don't rely on it, but on
.desktop and netwm icons only instead.

It's highly recommended to make sure a .desktop match the border you want to
dock in this module. See http://wiki.enlightenment.org/index.php/E17_and_Efreet#Border_Icons
for further explanation on how do this matching.

In order to add an icon to the module you have two ways. You can either drag and
drop the border icon on it, or configure the "Iiirk source". Which is a list of
.desktop to match automatically.

Once the icon is in the module, a click on it will toggle show/hide on the
corresponding window. Don't close your windows, what does the window when
closed is up to the application, not to the module. Use the minimize instead.
If the option "Hide window from any list when iconified" is enabled, minimize it
even by using the border button will active the skip window list on it.

Drop an icon outside the box will remove the match on the corresponding .desktop.
