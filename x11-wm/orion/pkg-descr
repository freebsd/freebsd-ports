Orion is a window manager for the X11 windowing system. Orion is
written in Scheme and accesses Xlib via the scx library for
scsh. Orion is in fact a family of window managers that can be
nested. This enables great flexibility and efficient handling of X11
applications. Orion currently comes with four child window managers:

 * a conventional moving window manager
 * a window manager for stacking windows in a frame
 * a window manager for splitting windows horizontally and vertically
 * a work space manager

Orion also supports saving the window manager layout and programmatic
configuration.
