The DeforaOS browser is a desktop file manager and desktop handler for
the DeforaOS desktop.

It supports browsing with multiple layouts (detailed, list, icons, and
thumbnails), MIME type application association, and file

It can be extended using a plug-in system, for which the following are
available:

   - quick preview for a number of file formats
   - support for git and Subversion repositories
   - recursive directory tree
   - file permissions.
