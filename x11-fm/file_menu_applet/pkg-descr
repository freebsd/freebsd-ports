[ excerpt from developer's site ]
File Menu Applet is a small GNOME panel application which 
creates a file manager. 

File Menu Applet is not designed to replace your existing 
file manager, but instead work with it. It supports standard 
drag and drop, GNOME file types, and Nautilus icons. 
I use it for small tasks such a easily attaching files to 
emails in Evolution by dragging them out of File Menu Applet 
into the Evolution composer window. 
It's also excellent for selecting songs to play from your 
MP3 or OGG collection.
