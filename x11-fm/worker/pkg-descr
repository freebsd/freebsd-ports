Worker is a file manager for X11, based on the famous Directory Opus file
manager for AmigaOS.  It is configurable on the fly without the need for
restart.  Any external program can be easily integrated in GUI, including
buttons and hotkeys.  Worker uses real file recognition on file content
and/or file ending, where each file type can get their own action.
