gentoo is a modern, powerful, flexible, and utterly configurable file manager
for UNIX systems, written using the GTK+ toolkit. It aims to be 100%
graphically configurable; there's no need to edit config files by hand and then
restart the application. gentoo is somewhat inspired in its look & feel by the
classic Amiga program DirectoryOpus.
