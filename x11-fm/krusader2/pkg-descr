Krusader is an advanced twin panel (commander style) file manager for KDE 3.1
or later, similar to Midnight or Total Commander, with many extras. It 
provides all the file-management features you could possibly want.

Plus: extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced 
search module, viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content 
comparisons, powerful batch renaming and much much more.

It supports the following archive formats: tar, zip, bzip2, gzip, rar, ace, 
arj and rpm and can handle other KIOSlaves such as smb or fish. It is 
(almost) completely customizable, very user friendly, fast and looks great 
on your desktop! :-)
