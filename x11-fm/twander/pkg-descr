"twander" is a Filesystem Browser which runs on both Unix-like systems
as well as Win32 systems.  It embraces the best ideas of both similar
GUI-driven programs (Konqueror, Windows Explorer) as well as
text-based interfaces (Midnight Commander, List, Sweep).

While the "twander" interface is graphical, all the major navigation,
selection, and execution commands can be entered from the keyboard,
not just the mouse.  This means Power Users who are strong typists can
minimize dependency on the mouse and materially speed up their
interactions with the system.

Moreover, unlike the other programs, "twander" does not have a
built-in set of commands (which typically cannot be changed).
Instead, "twander" supports a rich macro configuration language for
virtually limitless user-definition of commands.  The configuration
language provides a simple mechanism for communicating the list of
items currently selected in the GUI to the user-defined commands.

Each user is thus free to configure a command set unique and
appropriate to their needs.  As with the navigation commands,
user-defined commands can be invoked with either the keyboard (a
single keystroke) or the mouse (a menu selection).
