This is a hack to OffiX Files-2.4e to make it look like the NeXT file
manager.  The icons are now pretty.  This is basically a remake of what
Alfredo Kojima did in AfterStep-Plus many months ago.

It provides virtually all of the features that you would expect in a
file manager -- move around your directory tree in multiple windows,
move, copy or delete files, and launch programs with simple mouse operations.

It is dockable provided you use WindowMaker.
