A collection of Hebrew fonts from El-Mar software Ltd.

You'll have to add /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/hebrew
to you're X font path by either:

$ xset fp+ /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/hebrew
$ xset fp rehash

or by adding it to you're X-server configuration file (usually
/etc/XF86Config or /etc/Xaccel.ini) and restarting the X-server.
