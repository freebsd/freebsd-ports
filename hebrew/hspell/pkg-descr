Hspell is a fully working Hebrew spellchecker. On typical documents
it should recognize the majority of correct words. 
Hspell was designed to be 100% and strictly compliant with the
official niqqud-less spelling rules ("Ha-ktiv Khasar Ha-niqqud",
colloquially known as "Ktiv Male") published by the Academy of
the Hebrew Language.

Hspell was written by Nadav Har'El and Dan Kenigsberg.
