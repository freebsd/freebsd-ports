You'll have to add this port's directory (PREFIX/lib/X11/fonts/culmus
to you're X font path. Here's how:

$ xset fp+ PREFIX/lib/X11/fonts/culmus
$ xset fp rehash

or by adding a FontPath line for it in the X-server configuration file
(usually /etc/XF86Config or /etc/Xaccel.ini) and restarting the
X-server.

If you're using XFS it is also a good idea to add this directory to
your "catalogue" line in the XFS configuration file:
PREFIX/lib/X11/fs/config
