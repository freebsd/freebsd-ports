nec2c is a translation of the NEC2 FORTRAN source code to the C language. The
translation was performed mostly "by hand" and a lot of modifications to the
original program were introduced in order to modernize the NEC2 and to remove as
many built-in limitations as possible. The attendant SOMNEC program was also
translated to C and incorporated in nec2c as a function so that Sommerfeld
ground solutions are a part of the program.
