nec2c is a translation of the NEC2 FORTRAN source code to the C language.
The translation was performed mostly "by hand" and a lot of modifications
to the original program were introduced in order to modernize the NEC2
and to remove as many built-in limitations as possible. The attendant
SOMNEC program was also translated to C and incorporated in nec2c as a
function so that Sommerfeld ground solutions are a part of the program.
