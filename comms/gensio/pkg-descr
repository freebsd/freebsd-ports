Gensio is a framework for giving a consistent view of
various stream I/O types. You can stack gensio on top
of another one to add protocol functionality.
For instance, you can create a TCP gensio, stack SSL
on top of that, and stack Telnet on top of that.

gensio tools include gensiot, gtlssh(d), gtlssh-keygen
gmdns and gsound.
