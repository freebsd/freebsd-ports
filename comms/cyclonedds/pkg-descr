Eclipse Cyclone DDS is a very performant and robust open-source implementation
of the OMG DDS specification. Cyclone DDS is developed completely in the open
as an Eclipse IoT project (see eclipse-cyclone-dds) with a growing list of
adopters (if you're one of them, please add your logo). It is a tier-1
middleware for the Robot Operating System ROS 2.
