Eclipse Cyclone DDS is a very performant and robust open-source implementation
of the OMG DDS specification. Cyclone DDS is developed completely in the open as
an Eclipse IoT project (see eclipse-cyclone-dds) with a growing list of adopters
(if you're one of them, please add your logo). It is a tier-1 middleware for the
Robot Operating System ROS 2.
