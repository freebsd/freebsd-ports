The KB contest logging computer program runs on the Linux operating system
with the Gnome desktop. The program is under development, and currently
supports the CQ WW, CQ WPX, and ARRL DX contests, plus Field Day.
Features include on-the-fly dupe checking, CW and voice message keying,
super check partial, packet (Telnet and rf nodes), networking, and
radio control (currently for the FT-1000 only). The program is designed
to be used by U.S. stations, with some support for Canadian stations.
New features and contests are being added regularly, and I will consider
adding support for DX stations if there is sufficient demand.

(The port version has bug fixes and some modifications for Canadian stations.
