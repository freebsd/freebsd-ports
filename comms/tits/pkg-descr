The tits command is a server process which provides telnet(1) access
to one or more tty ports as specified in config-file (or
/etc/tits.conf if no configuration file is specified on the command
line).

Any number of telnet(1) clients may connect to a single tits port.
Each client will see exactly the same output as well as being able to
send keystrokes simultaneously.
