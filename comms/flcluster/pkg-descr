flcluster is a stand alone dx cluster client that will also connect to fldigi
and act as the dx cluster client for fldigi. Multiple instances of flcluster   
can simultaneously connect to fldigi, and fldigi's internal dx cluster client
can also be connected at the same time.  Connectivity is via a socket interface,
so flclient can reside on the same or a different computer on the LAN or WAN
so long as it is possible to establish the socket (xmlrpc) connection.
