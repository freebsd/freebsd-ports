This port does not contain any FreeBSD device drivers for infrared
devices. This port installs the LIRC daemons and tools for interacting
with drivers that support the LIRC device interface.

You will need to obtain third party device drivers or port the Linux
drivers in ${WRKSRC}/drivers to use the LIRC port.

Update for 0.9:  Known working with this update are FTDI-based USB
IR receivers/transmitters like described here,

	http://www.huitsing.nl/irftdi/

and if you use the recent multimedia/webcamd port then MCE USB based
ones driven by the Linux mceusb driver as well remotes coming with
USB DVB tuners that by default work with the Linux drivers used in
webcamd should also work, i.e. if webcamd creates a /dev/lircX
device node check if e.g.

	mode2 -d /dev/lirc0

reports pulses and spaces when triggering the remote at the receiver,
if it does you probably will be able to use lirc.

Some other userland drivers will probably also work (like others
using libusb), they just were not tested.

The lirc documentation should be accessible at:

	%%LOCALBASE%%/share/doc/lirc/html/index.html

Some example configs should have been installed here:

	%%LOCALBASE%%/share/examples/lirc/remotes

The port now installs an example lircd.conf that's preconfigured
for use with webcamd, either with USB DVB tuner remotes supported
by the Linux drivers by default that webcamd uses, or for remotes
supplied with MCE USB IR receivers.  If you want to create a config
for a different remote using an IR receiver that works with mode2
you can try using irrecord like described here:

	file://%%LOCALBASE%%/share/doc/lirc/html/help.html#new_remote

Update for webcamd >= 3.0.0.1:

webcamd 3.0.0.1 now supports /dev/input/eventX (X there can be for
example 0, 8, 16 etc) and uses it exclusively for almost all tuners,
only mceusb IR-only devices now support both interfaces.  So if you
don't get a /dev/lircX device node anymore and want to make lirc
use a remote with such a tuner you now need the lirc devinput driver,
if you start lircd via the rc.d script set lircd_flags and lircd_device
in rc.conf(5), like:

	lircd_flags="-H devinput"
	lircd_device="/dev/input/event0"

The example lircd.conf includes the devinput config file too so if
all goes well irw(1) should still work with such tuners and show
buttons pressed, and if not and the tuner's Linux driver uses the
rc.core interface you can often still add a custom keymap, only
with devinput you no longer want to use irrecord(1) but ir-keytable(1)
which is part of the multimedia/v4l-utils port.  Using that tool
you can e.g. check remote events coming in on /dev/input/eventX,

	ir-keytable -d /dev/input/eventX -t

list the current keytable,

	ir-keytable -d /dev/input/eventX -r

or add scancodes on the fly by loading a custom keymap,

	ir-keytable -d /dev/input/eventX -w keymap.txt

(on Linux this can be automated using udev, don't know if we need
something like that also...)  Some (Linux-centric, so not all of
them apply) notes re ir-keytable(1) and the lirc devinput change
are also here:
