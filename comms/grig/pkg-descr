Grig is a graphical front-end to the Ham Radio libraries
written using Gtk+ and Gnome widgets by Alexandru Csete.

Part of the grounstation suite, it purpose is to control
an amateur radio transceiver from X. It supports any of
the transceivers that hamlib supports, including rpc.rigd
over the network. However, at present only a subset of the
hamlib functions are provided.

The groundstation suite comprises Gnome-rig and Gnome-predict
and is intended to provide a low-cost amateur radio station
with the facilities of a high-end satellite station.
