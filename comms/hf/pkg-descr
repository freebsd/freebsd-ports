hf is a gtk+-based Linux ham radio fsk digimode program, which can do also
the realtime ARQ modes pactor 1, amtor, gtor without a ptc, only with a
soundcard and a PC and Linux (FreeBSD), all of which need not be the newest.
The core of hf, the heart of the program (hfkernel) is a real master-piece
of code, it has originally been made by Tom Sailer, many thanks Tom!
hf can also do MT63 and has a CW elbug function.
