Xlog is an Amateur Radio station logger.  Xlog is able to do
DXCC lookups and will display country information, CQ and ITU zone,
location in latitude and longitude and distance and heading in
kilometers or miles, both for short and long path. Locator distance
and heading calculation for VHF logging is also supported.

Xlog supports cabrillo, ADIF, trlog, and EDI and can import
twlog, editest and OH1AA logbook files.
It also has the ability to customise log fields which makes it ideal for
use in those countries that have odd logging rules such as the U.K. Also
included is the ability to log using the FCC emissions codes.
