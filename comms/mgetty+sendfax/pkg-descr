Mgetty is a ``smart'' getty replacement, designed to be used with Hayes
compatible data and data/fax modems.

Mgetty knows about modem initialization, manual modem answering (so your
modem doesn't answer if the machine isn't ready), UUCP locking (so you can
use the same device for dial-in and dial-out).

Mgetty provides very extensive logging facilities.

Sendfax sends the named g3 fax files to the fax machine at "phone number". 
The g3 files can be created with pbmtog3(1) or GNU's GhostScript with the
"digifax" driver.
