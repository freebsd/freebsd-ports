NOTICE
======

A devd rule has been installed to automatically notify telldusd
when a new device has been detected.

Please restart devd to activate this:

	/etc/rc.d/devd restart

Edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/tellstick.conf to configure some devices,
and enable telldusd in rc.conf.

Then start telldusd.

When starting for the first time, you might need to unplug/plugin the device
to allow devd to fix the permissions on the /dev/ugenX.X device.
