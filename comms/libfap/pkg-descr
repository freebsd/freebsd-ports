libfap is a quick and dirty C port of the Ham::APRS::FAP
Finnish APRS Parser Perl module.

As the original Perl code, libfap parses normal,
mic-e and compressed location packets, NMEA location packets, objects,
items, messages, telemetry and most weather packets.
For more description, see the Perl module.
