Eat's name is self-explanatory, it stands for "Emulate A Terminal". Eat
is a terminal emulator. It can run most (if not all) full-screen
terminal programs, including Emacs.

It is pretty fast, more than three times faster than Term, despite
being implemented entirely in Emacs Lisp. So fast that you can
comfortably run Emacs inside Eat, or even use your Emacs as a terminal
multiplexer.

It has many features that other Emacs terminal emulator still don't
have, for example Sixel support, complete mouse support, shell
integration, etc.

It flickers less than other Emacs terminal emulator, so you get more
performance and a smoother experience.

To get the most out of Eat, you should also setup shell integration.
