libirman is a library for accessing the IRMAN hardware from Linux
and other Unix systems.

Currently the package is mainly for advanced users and developers; this
does not mean that less experienced users will not be able to use it, but
that there are not a lot of applications for libirman at the moment, and
that if you run into problems you may have difficulty fixing things.
