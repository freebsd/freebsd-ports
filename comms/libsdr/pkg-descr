A simple software defined radio (SDR) library.
Although being simple, libsdr is sufficient to write a simple SDR receiver
application (github.com/hmatuschek/sdr-rx, above). This RX application
supports several input sources (i.e. sound card, files, RTL2382 dongles etc.)
and modes (i.e. AM, FM, SSB, CW, etc.).
