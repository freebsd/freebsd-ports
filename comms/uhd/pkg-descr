UHD is the "Universal Software Radio Peripheral" (USRP) Hardware Driver. It 
works on all major platforms (Linux, Windows, and Mac); and can be built with
GCC, Clang, and MSVC compilers.

The goal of UHD is to provide a host driver and API for current and 
future Ettus Research products. Users will be able to use the UHD driver
standalone or with third-party applications such as:

    GNU Radio
    LabVIEW
    Simulink
    OpenBTS
