A Linux toolkit for handling signals over the automatric picture
transmission (APT) protocol.

## Intro to Automatic Picture Transmission
Automatic picture transmission (APT) is an analog image transmission format
developed for use on weather satellites in the 1960s. While only three
modern satellites, NOAA 15, NOAA 18, and NOAA 19, transmit on the APT
protocol, building a reception station is cheap and simple. The images can
be quite high qualitythey natively have a resolution of 
4 km/px. It is reasonable to expect at least one good-quality satellite
pass (and, thereby, opportunity for image downlink) per day.
