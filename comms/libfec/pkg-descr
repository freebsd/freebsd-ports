This library package provides several forward error correction (FEC) decoders
and accelerated primitives useful in digital signal processing (DSP).
Except for the Reed-Solomon codecs, these functions take full advantage of
the MMX, SSE and SSE2 SIMD instruction sets on Intel/AMD IA-32 processors
and the Altivec/VMX/Velocity Engine SIMD instruction set on the
G4 and G5 PowerPC.
The library includes Viterbi decoders for the following convolutional codes:
rate 1/2 k=7
rate 1/2 k=9
rate 1/6 k=15 ("Cassini")
plus two Reed-Solomon encoder-decoders:
one optimized for the (255,223) CCSDS standard code
a general purpose encoder/decoder for arbitrary RS codes
and three low-level 16-bit DSP support routines:
signed dot product
peak detection
sum-of-squares (energy) computation
