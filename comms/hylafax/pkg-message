Hylafax was installed.  You'll need manual configurations to actually
activate it.

Setting up: (for impatients)
	Invoke /usr/local/sbin/faxsetup, and answer the questions.
	Mostly, accepting the defaults should work well.

	When you are asked to specify the name of tty device, use "cuaa1"
	instead of "ttyd1".  Otherwise it does not work well.

	Consult /usr/local/etc/rc.d/hylafax.sh.sample for startups.

	For accepting incoming FAX/data calls, modify /etc/ttys as below
	and send SIGHUP to init process:

>cuaa1	"/usr/local/sbin/faxgetty"	dialup	on secure
