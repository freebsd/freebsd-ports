Remserial acts as a communications bridge between a TCP/IP network port and a
device such as a serial port. Any character-oriented /dev device will work.

The program can operate as a server accepting network connections from other
machines, or as a client, connecting to remote machine that is running the
remserial program or some other program that accepts a raw network connection.
The network connection passes data as-is, there is no control protocol over the
network socket.

Multiple copies of the program can run on the same computer at the same time
assuming each is using a different network port and device.
