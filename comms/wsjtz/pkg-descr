WSJT ("Weak Signal Communication, by K1JT") offers specific digital protocols
optimized for meteor scatter, ionospheric scatter, and EME (moonbounce)
at VHF/UHF, as well as HF skywave propagation.  The program can decode
fraction-of-a-second signals reflected from ionized meteor trails and
steady signals 10 dB below the audible threshold.

WSJT-Z is a clone of WSJT-X software by Joe Taylor K1JT
