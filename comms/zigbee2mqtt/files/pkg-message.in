  message: <<EOM
There are some breaking changes:

- Improved adapter discovery; when upgrading from Zigbee2MQTT 1.x.x, this might
  result in USB adapter discovery error (No valid USB adapter found), see
  https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/discussions/24198 for details.

- zstack is no longer the default for adapter setting. If Zigbee2MQTT fails to
  start saying the adapter could not be discovered, it means your adapter uses
  an identification not currently recognized by Zigbee2MQTT, make sure to
  specify the adapter setting if that's the case.

See https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/discussions/24198 for full details
on (possibly) breaking changes.

Take a backup of %%Z2M_DATADIR%% before restarting the service!
