Normally, dcf77pi and readpin need to be run as root due to the permissions of
/dev/gpioc* , but they can be run as a regular user by changing the permissions
of the device node:

# chmod 0660 /dev/gpioc*

And to make the change persistent across reboots:

# echo "perm gpioc* 0660" >> /etc/devfs.conf
