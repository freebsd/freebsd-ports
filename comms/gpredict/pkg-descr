Gpredict is a real time satellite tracking and orbit prediction program
written using the Gtk+ widgets. Gpredict is targetted mainly towards ham
radio operators but others interested in satellite tracking may find it
useful as well. Gpredict uses the SGP4/SDP4 algorithms, which are
compatible with the NORAD Keplerian elements.
