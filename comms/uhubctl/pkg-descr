Uhubctl is utility to control USB power per-port on smart USB hubs.
Smart hub is defined as one that implements per-port power switching.

Note that quite a few modern motherboards have built-in root hubs
that do support this feature - you may not even need to buy any external hub.

This utility was tested to compile and work on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian,
Redhat/EPEL/Fedora/CentOS, Arch Linux, Gentoo, openSUSE, Buildroot), FreeBSD,
NetBSD, SunOS and MacOS.
