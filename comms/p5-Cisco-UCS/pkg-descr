This package provides an abstracted interface to the Cisco UCS Manager XML API
and Cisco UCS Management Information Model.

The Cisco UCS Manager (UCSM) is an embedded software agent providing access to
the hardware and configuration management features of attached Cisco UCS
hardware. The Management Information Model for the UCSM is organised into a
structured heirachy of both physical and virtual objects. Accessing objects
within the heirachy is done through a number of high level calls to heirachy
search and traversal methods
