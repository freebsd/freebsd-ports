The Ham Radio Control Libraries, Hamlib for short, is a development effort
to provide a consistent interface for programmers wanting to incorporate
radio control in their programs.
Hamlib will allow authors of software logging programs, digital communications 
programs, or those wanting to develop the ultimate radio control software to 
concentrate on the user interface and the basic function of the program rather 
than radio control.
