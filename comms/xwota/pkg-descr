Xwota is a very simple Linux/FreeBSD/xBSD client for the WOTA Database
(Who is On The Air Database) written by me (IZ0ETE).
It's very similar to a DX Cluster client, but it works with the WOTA server.
If you don't known what is the WOTA DB, please read some info at
http://www.wotadb.org.
It's written in C and GTK, and it should work on the latest
Linux/BSD distributions.
Please report to me your successful installation. (Linux, FreeBSD at the moment)
