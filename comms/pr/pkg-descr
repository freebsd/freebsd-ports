The package consists of two programs - PortRedorector and PortTest.

PortRedirector is a daemon that runs telnet to the remote port of the
terminal server and redirects its input and output to a virtual
terminal device (/dev/pty*). The corresponding slave device (dev/tty*)
then can be used by an application that expects a local async terminal
port. For example, to monitor a UPS (connected to AUX ports on a Cisco router)
using nut.

Whenever telnet subprocess terminates on any reason, it is restarted
as soon as any data received from the terminal device.

It can also work when authentication is required, i.e. it can pass username
and password specified in its configuration file.

PortTest is something like cu(1). You can use either of them to test the
connection.
