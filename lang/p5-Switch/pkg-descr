Switch.pm provides the syntax and semantics for an explicit case
mechanism for Perl. The syntax is minimal, introducing only the
keywords switch and case and conforming to the general pattern of
existing Perl control structures. The semantics are particularly
rich, allowing any one (or more) of nearly 30 forms of matching to
be used when comparing a switch value with its various cases.
