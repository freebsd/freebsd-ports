The Pentium Compiler GROUP's PGCC

The Pentium Compiler Group was formed to create a version of GCC supporting
x86 specific optimizations.  Their work is based off of Cygnus's EGCS
compiler suite.

Beware: This port installs new versions of "gcc", "g++", "c++", "egcc",
"eg++" and so forth into the "${PREFIX}/bin" directory.
Mind your PATHs if you don't want to use this compiler by default.
