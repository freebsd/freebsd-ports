   Icon is a high-level programming language with extensive facilities for
processing strings and structures.  Icon has several novel features,
including expressions that may produce sequences of results, goal-directed
evaluation that automatically searches for a successful result, and string
scanning that allows operations on strings to be formulated at a high
conceptual level.

The language is described in R.  E.  Griswold and M.  T.  Griswold, The
Icon Programming Language, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ,
second edition, 1990.
