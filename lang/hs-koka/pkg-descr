Koka is a strongly typed functional-style language with effect types
and handlers.

Koka v2 is a research language that is currently under development and not ready
for production use. Nevertheless, the language is stable and the compiler
implements the full specification. The main things lacking at the moment are
libraries, package management, and deep IDE integration.
