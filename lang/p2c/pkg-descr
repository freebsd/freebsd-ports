P2c is a tool for translating Pascal programs into C. The input consists
of a set of source files in any of the following Pascal dialects: HP
Pascal, Turbo/UCSD Pascal, DEC VAX Pascal, Oregon Software Pascal/2,
Macintosh Programmer's Workshop Pascal, Sun/Berkeley Pascal, Texas
Instruments Pascal, Apollo Domain Pascal. Modula-2 syntax is also
supported. Output is a set of .c and .h files that comprise an
equivalent program in any of several dialects of C. Output code may be
kept machine- and dialect independent, or it may be targeted to a
specific machine and compiler. Most reasonable Pascal programs are
converted into fully functional C which will compile and run with no
further modifications, although p2c sometimes chooses to generate
readable code at the expense of absolute generality. P2c endeavors to
insert notes and warning messages into the output code to point out
areas which may require human intervention. Output code is arranged to
be readable and efficient, and to make use of C idioms wherever
possible. The main goal of the translation is to produce C files which
are pleasant and "natural" enough to be acceptable as the new source
files for a program. In a pinch, p2c will also serve as an ad hoc Pascal
compiler. The p2cc script makes it easy to use p2c as a compiler.
