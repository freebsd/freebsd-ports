The LDC project aims to provide a portable D programming language compiler
with modern optimization and code generation capabilities.

The compiler uses the official DMD frontends to support the latest version of
D2, and relies on the LLVM Core libraries for code generation.

LDC is fully Open Source; the parts of the code not taken/adapted from other
projects are BSD-licensed (see the LICENSE file for details).
