typstyle is a reliable typst code formatter.

Design Goals
1. Opinionated: We want to have a consistent style across all codebases.
2. Code only: We want to format only the code. Contents should be left untouched
   as much as possible.
3. Convergence: Running the formatter twice should not change the code.
4. Correctness: The formatter should not change the looking of the rendered
   output.
