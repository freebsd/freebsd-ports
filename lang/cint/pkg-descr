CINT is a C/C++ interpreter aimed at processing C/C++ scripts.

CINT covers about 95% of ANSI C and 85% of C++. A CINT script can call
compiled classes/functions and compiled code can make callbacks to CINT
user defined functions. Utilities, like makecint and rootcint, automate
the process of embedding compiled C/C++ library code as shared objects
(as Dynamic Link Library, DLL, or shared library, .so). Source files
and shared objects can be dynamically loaded/unloaded without stopping
the CINT process. CINT offers a gdb like debugging environment for
interpreted programs.
