Rizin is a free and open source reverse engineering framework. It takes a
unique, Unix-friendly approach on reverse engineering. By default, it can be
used in a shell-like environment tailored specifically to analyzing binaries
directly from the command line without unnecessary weight. However, if you do
want more, it provides a perfect basis for GUI and scripting.
