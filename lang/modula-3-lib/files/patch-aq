New package "m3configvars".  This does the same thing as "m3config", but
instead of constants for the configuration parameters, it uses variables
that are initialized at start up.  This makes it much easier to change
the Modula-3 installation directory, by simply building a new shared
library for "m3configvars".  With this approach, there is no need to
recompile or even relink applications.
