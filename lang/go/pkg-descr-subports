Go is an open source programming environment that makes it easy to build
simple, reliable, and efficient software.

FreeBSD allows you to install multiple versions of Go at the same time.
As a result, this package installs only versioned binaries (i.e. goXYZ,
gofmtXYZ). To get unversioned names (go, gofmt, etc.) install the "go"
package or the lang/go port.
