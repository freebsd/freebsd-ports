The Quantum::Superpositions module adds two new operators to Perl: any and
all.

Each of these operators takes a list of values (states) and superimposes
them into a single scalar value (a superposition), which can then be
stored in a standard scalar variable.

The any and all operators produce two distinct kinds of superposition. The
any operator produces a disjunctive superposition, which may (notionally)
be in any one of its states at any time, according to the needs of the
algorithm that uses it.

In contrast, the all operator creates a conjunctive superposition, which
is always in every one of its states simultaneously.

Superpositions are scalar values and hence can participate in arithmetic
and logical operations just like any other type of scalar. However, when
an operation is applied to a superposition, it is applied (notionally) in
parallel to each of the states in that superposition.
