------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gofer is an interactive functional programming environment (i.e. an
interpreter) supporting a language based on the draft report for Haskell
version 1.2.

Gofer is intended as an experimental language, particularly where type classes
are involved.  Gofer extends the Haskell type class system in several ways.

The most significant features of Haskell not currently supported are:
modules, arrays, overloaded numeric constants, default declarations, derived
instances, contexts in datatype definitions.
