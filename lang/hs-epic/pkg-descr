Epic is a simple functional language which compiles to reasonably efficient C code,
using the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector [1].  It is intended as a compiler
back-end, and is currently used as a back end for Epigram [2] and Idris [3].  It
can be invoked either as a library or an application.
