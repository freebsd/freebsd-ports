Open Object Rexx is a powerful object-oriented scripting language. The
interpreter is almost fully compatible with the original Object Rexx by IBM.
The port is derived from the generic Unix source code, with the idea to add
BSD-specific enhancements over time and also to develop modules that would
allow to run the most of OS/2 Object Rexx code on BSD platforms.
