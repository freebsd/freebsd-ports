Whitespace is a imperative stack-based programming language that,
contrary to most languages, ignores any non-whitespace characters.
Only spaces, tabs, and newlines are considered syntax in Whitespace.

This port is a prototype interpreter for the Whitespace programming
language written in Haskell.
