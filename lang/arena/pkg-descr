The Arena language was designed with the following main features in mind,
most of which were added on top of a very C-like core to support better
ad-hoc scripting:

    * syntax similar to ANSI C
    * standard library similar to ANSI C
    * automatic memory management
    * runtime polymorphism
    * support for exceptions
    * support for anonymous functions

Additionally, an interpreter for the Arena language can be implemented
to be very compact in terms of both source code size and memory consumption.
