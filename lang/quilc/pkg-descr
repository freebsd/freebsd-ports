Quilc is an advanced optimizing compiler for the quantum instruction
language Quil.

Quil is the quantum instruction language, originally developed at
Rigetti Computing. In Quil quantum algorithms are expressed using
Quil's standard gates and instructions. One can also use Quil's
DEFGATE to define new non-standard gates, and DEFCIRCUIT to build a
named circuit that can be referenced elsewhere in Quil code (analogous
to a function in most other programming languages).
