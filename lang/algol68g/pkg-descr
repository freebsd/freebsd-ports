The development of Algol played an important role in establishing
computer science as an academic discipline.  The Algol 68 Genie project
preserves Algol 68 out of educational as well as scientific-historical
interest, by making a modern, well-featured hybrid compiler-interpreter
written from scratch, which ranks among the most complete Algol 68
implementations.  It features arbitrary precision arithmetic, complex
numbers, parallel processing, partial parameterization, and formatted
transput, as well as support for curses, regular expressions, and sound.
