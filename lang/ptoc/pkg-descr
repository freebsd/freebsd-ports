This is yet another  ANSI/Turbo Pascal to C/C++ converter together
with BGI graphics library emulation for X Window System.

Converter  recognizes  Pascal  dialects  which are compatible with
Turbo Pascal 4.0/5.0  and  ISO Pascal  standard - IEC 7185:1990(E)
(including conformant arrays). Now it is tuned for Oregon Pascal-2
V2.1 which has few extensions to standard Pascal.

Converter can produce both C++ and C output.

Now  PTOC  recognizes  Turbo  Pascal's  extensions, such as units,
strings,   some  special   types   and   operations. Turbo  Pascal
extensions are supported only for C++ language.

Also emulation libraries  of  Borland Graphics Interface (BGI) for
X Window System  included in this  distribution (BGI emulators can
be also used without converter for C programs using BGI).
