The SIMULA programming language was designed and built by Ole-Johan Dahl 
and Kristen Nygaard at the Norwegian Computing Centre (NCC) in Oslo 
between 1962 and 1967.1 It was originally designed and implemented as a 
language for discrete event simulation, but was later expanded and 
reimplemented as a full scale general purpose programming language.

Although SIMULA never became widely used, the language has been highly 
influential on modern programming methodology. Among other things SIMULA 
introduced important object-oriented programming concepts like classes and
objects, inheritance, and dynamic binding.
