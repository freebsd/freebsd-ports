QScheme is a fast and small implementation of Scheme written in C. QScheme is
easy to interface and should be easy to use as an extension language.

QScheme currently supports foreign function call and dynamic library. A perl
like regular expression module is provided as example.

QScheme is really fast: benchmarks (still a little old) shows that it is
generaly between 2 and 70 times faster than other scheme interpreters.

Documentation and GTK support has been disabled in this port.
