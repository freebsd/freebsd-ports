nwcc is a small C compiler for Unix systems under the BSDL

The primary goals of nwcc currently are portability and correctness.
Various C99 and GNU C features are also supported.

It works with FreeBSD/OpenBSD/Solaris/Linux on 80x86, FreeBSD/Linux on AMD64,
Solaris on SPARC, AIX on PowerPC, and IRIX on MIPS hardware.
Cross-compilation is also supported.
The x86 and AMD64 backends support two assemblers; nasm/yasm and gas.
This can be useful for side-by-side assembler syntax comparison
