Copper an experimental programming language used to develop Code Browser 4.
It is based on Zinc [http://tibleiz.net/zinc/] with some improvements such
as genericity, multiple return values or variadic arguments. It does not
generate intermediary C code anymore, it has two backends: a x86 COFF
generator and LLVM (version 2.9).
