Scheme 48 is an implementation of the Scheme programming language as
described in the Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme.
It is based on a compiler and interpreter for a virtual Scheme
machine.  The name derives from our desire to have an implementation
that is simple and lucid enough that it looks as if it were written in
just 48 hours.  We don't claim to have reached that stage yet; much
more simplification is necessary.
Scheme 48 is an implementation of the Scheme programming language as described
in the Revised5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme [6]. It is based on
a compiler and interpreter for a virtual Scheme machine. Scheme 48 tries to be
faithful to the Revised5 Scheme Report, providing neither more nor less in the
initial user environment. (This is not to say that more isn't available in
other environments; see below.)
Scheme 48 is under continual development. Please report bugs, especially in
the VM, especially core dumps, to scheme-48-bugs@s48.org. Include the version
number x.yy from the "Welcome to Scheme 48 x.yy" greeting message in your bug
report. It is a goal of this project to produce a bullet-proof system; we want
no bugs and, especially, no crashes.
