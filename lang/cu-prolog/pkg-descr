cu-Prolog is an experimental constraint logic programming language.
Unlike most conventional CLP systems, cu-Prolog allows user-defined 
predicates as constraints and is suitable for implementing a natural 
language processing system based on the unification-based 
grammar. As an application of cu-Prolog, we developed 
a JPSG (Japanese Phrase Structure Grammar) parser 
with the JPSG Working Group (the chairman is Prof. GUNJI, Takao of
Osaka University) at ICOT. 

cu-Prolog is also the complete implementation of the constraint
unification and its name (cu) comes from the technique.
