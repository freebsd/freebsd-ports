Afnix (formerly known as Aleph) is a multi-threaded functional programming
language with dynamic symbol bindings that support the object oriented
paradigm. Afnix features a state of the art runtime engine that supports
both 32 and 64 bits platforms. Afnix comes with a rich set of libraries
that are designed to be platform independent.

The Afnix engine is written in C++ and provides runtime compatibility with
it. Such compatibility includes the ability to instantiate C++ classes,
use virtual methods and raise or catch exceptions. A comprehensive API has
been designed to ease the integration of foreign libraries.
