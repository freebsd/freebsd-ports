PHP, which stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" is a widely-used Open
Source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for
Web development and can be embedded into HTML.  Its syntax draws upon C,
Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn.  The main goal of the language is to
allow web developers to write dynamically generated webpages quickly, but
you can do much more with PHP.
