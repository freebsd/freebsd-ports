# The following modification to CXXFLAGS is needed in the case of DragonFly
# 4.1+ building lang/gcc5 with the gcc50 base compiler when the system
# libraries were built by the gcc47 base compiler.  The sys.mk file
# automatically adds -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 to CXXFLAGS in that case,
# which will break the build.

CXXFLAGS:=	${CXXFLAGS:N-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI*}
