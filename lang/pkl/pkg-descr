Pkl - pronounced Pickle - is an embeddable configuration language which
provides rich support for data templating and validation. It can be used from
the command line, integrated in a build pipeline, or embedded in a program.

Pkl scales from small to large, simple to complex, ad-hoc to repetitive
configuration tasks.
