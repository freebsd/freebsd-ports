A GNUstep-aware scheme interpreter. You need libflex installed on your system.
Includes many examples, e.g. the sieve of Erathostenes to compute primes,
a Koch curve plotter, mandelbrot set, graphs of various functions etc.
GScheme is fully tail recursive. The garbage collector bypasses GNUstep's
retain/release mechanism in order to deal with circular data structures.
GScheme is document-based and you can edit more than one file at the same time.
