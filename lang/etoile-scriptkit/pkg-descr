ScriptKit is a very lightweight cross-app scripting framework built on top of
Distributed Objects. It simply exports a dictionary containing a set of named
objects for scripting with Objective-C or any languages based on the LanguageKit
such as Pragmatic Smalltalk.

This is used for example by the hit corners and gesture recognition tool to run
arbitrary commands in response to corner activations or mouse gestures, and by
ScriptServices which allows arbitrary shell or Smalltalk scripts to be invoked
on the current selection from any GNUstep or Etoile application.
