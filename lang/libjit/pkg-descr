The libjit library implements Just-In-Time compilation functionality. Unlike
other JIT's, this one is designed to be independent of any particular virtual
machine bytecode format or language. The hope is that Free Software projects
can get a leg-up on proprietry VM vendors by using this library rather than
spending large amounts of time writing their own JIT from scratch.

This JIT is also designed to be portable to multiple archictures. If you run
libjit on a machine for which a native code generator is not yet available,
then libjit will fall back to interpreting the code. This way, you don't need
to write your own interpreter for your bytecode format if you don't want to.
