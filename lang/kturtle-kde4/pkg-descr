KTurtle is an educational programming environment for KDE. KTurtle
aims to make programming as easy and touchable as possible, and
therefore can be used to teach kids the basics of math, geometry
and... programming.

The programming language used in KTurtle is loosely based on Logo.
KTurtle allows, just like some implementations of Logo, to translate
the programming language (the commands, the documentation and the
error messages) to the native language of the programmer. Translating
the programming language to the native language of the programmer is
one of the many ways KTurtle tries to make learning to programming
more simple. Other features to help to achieve this goal are:
intuitive syntax highlighting, simple error messages, integrated
canvas to make drawings on, integrated help function, slow-motion or
step execution, and more.
