Kawa is a full Scheme implementation written in Java.  With Kawa you can
access Java objects, methods, fields and classes within your Scheme code.
Scheme functions and files are compiled into optimized Java byte-code,
allowing you to write Java applications, applets, classes, and servlets
in Scheme.
