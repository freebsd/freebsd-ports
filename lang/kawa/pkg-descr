Kawa is a full Scheme implementation written in Java. With Kawa
you can access Java objects, methods, fields and classes within
your scheme code. Scheme functions and files are compiled into
optimized Java byte-code, allowing you to write Java
applications, applets, classes, and servlets in scheme.
