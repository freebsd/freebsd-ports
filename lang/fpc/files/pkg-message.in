1) Add lib paths to %%PREFIX%%/etc/fpc.cfg

   # searchpath for libraries
   -Fl/usr/local/lib

   This is necessary for correct linking of libraries.

2) If you want to see all documentation about FreePascal, you can install

   * lang/fpc-docs

3) Take on mind that fpc only works with binutils on this moment but could work
   with another ld tool later on next versions of freepascal

4) Enjoy it ;)
