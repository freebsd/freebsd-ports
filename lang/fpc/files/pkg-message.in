1) Add lib paths to %%PREFIX%%/etc/fpc.cfg

   # searchpath for libraries
   -Fl/usr/local/lib

   This is necessary for correct linking of libraries.

2) If you want to see all documentation about FreePascal, you can install

   * lang/fpc-docs

3) This port add support to fp compiler to get value from FPC_LDPATH 
   environment variable. By default fp compiler use %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/ld.bfd for 
   linking binaries. If you want change this, just must be define FPC_LDPATH 
   with path to ld tool that will be used by fp compiler. Take on mind that fpc 
   only works with binutils on this moment but could work with another ld tool
   later on next versions of freepascal

4) Enjoy it ;)
