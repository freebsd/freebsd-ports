ChaiScript is a scripting language designed specifically for integration with
C++. It provides seamless integration with C++ on all levels, including
shared_ptr objects, functors and exceptions.

The parts of the ChaiScript API that the average user will be concerned with are
contained in the chaiscript namespace and the chaiscript::ChaiScript class.

The end user parts of the API are extremely simple both in size and ease of use.
