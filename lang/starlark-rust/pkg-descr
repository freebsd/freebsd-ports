The starlark-rust project provides a Rust implementation of the
Starlark language.
Starlark is a deterministic language inspired by Python3, used for configuration
in the build systems
Bazel, Buck and Buck2

Project features:
- Easy interoperability between Rust types and Starlark.
- Rust-friendly types, so frozen values are Send/Sync, while non-frozen
  values aren't.
- Garbage collected values allocated on a heap.
- Optional runtime-checked types.
- A linter, to detect code issues in Starlark.
- IDE integration in the form of LSP.
- Extensive testing, including fuzz testing.
- DAP support.
