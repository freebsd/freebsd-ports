The AUX compiler supports several languages: Ada, C, C++, Fortran and
Objective-C.  Since Ada support must be built by an Ada-capable compiler,
only platforms for which a bootstrap compiler is available can build it.

The AUX compiler is based on release versions of the Free Software
Foundation's GNU Compiler Collection.  It uses the GCC Runtime Library
Exception, so the resulting binaries have no licensing requirements.
Binaries produced by the AUX compiler should be legally handled the same
as binaries produced by any FSF compiler.

This compiler implements the full Ada-83, Ada-95, Ada-2005 and Ada-2012
standards.
