tinypy is a minimalist implementation of python in 64k of code

it includes a whole heap of features:

 * parser and bytecode compiler written in tinypy
 * fully bootstrapped
 * luaesque virtual machine with garbage collection written in C
   it's "stackless" sans any "stackless" features
 * cross-platform :) it runs under Windows / Linux / OS X
 * a fairly decent subset of python
    o classes and single inheritance
    o functions with variable or keyword arguments
    o strings, lists, dicts, numbers
    o modules, list comprehensions
    o exceptions with full traceback
    o some builtins 
 * batteries not included -- yet
