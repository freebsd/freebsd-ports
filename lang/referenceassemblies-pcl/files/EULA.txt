3.  SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement
    only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves
    all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights
    despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly
    permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any
    technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it
    in certain ways. You may not
     -  work around any technical limitations in the software;
     -  reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except
        and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits,
        despite this limitation;

     -  rent, lease or lend the software.

4.  FEEDBACK. You may provide feedback about the software. If you give
    feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft,
    without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your
    feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third
    parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their
    products, technologies and services to use or interface with any
    specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the
    feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license
    that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to
    third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights
    survive this agreement.

5.  TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY. The first user of the software may
    transfer it, and this agreement, directly to a third party. Before
    the transfer, that party must agree that this agreement applies to
    the transfer and use of the software. The first user must uninstall
    the software before transferring it separately from the device. The
    first user may not retain any copies.

6.  EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export
    laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and
    international export laws and regulations that apply to the
    software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users
    and end use. For additional information,
    see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

7.  SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is "as is," we may not
    provide support services for it.

8.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements,
    updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use,
    are the entire agreement for the software and any support services
    we provide.

9.  APPLICABLE LAW.
    a.  United States. If you acquired the software in the United
        States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this
        agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of
        conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you
        live govern all other claims, including claims under state
        consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
    b.  Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any
        other country, the laws of that country apply.

10. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may
    have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have
    rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the
    software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws
    of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do
    so.

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR
    THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES,
    GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR
    STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT
    CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS,
    MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

    FOR AUSTRALIA - YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN
    CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE
    RIGHTS.

12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER
    FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S.
    $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING
    CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL
    DAMAGES.

    This limitation applies to
     -  anything related to the software, services, content (including
        code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs;
        and
     -  claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
        condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
        extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about
    the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion
    may not apply to you because your country may not allow the
    exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other
    damages.
