SDCC is a retargettable, optimizing ANSI C compiler suite that targets
the Intel MCS51 based microprocessors (8031, 8032, 8051, 8052, etc.),
Maxim (formerly Dallas) DS80C390 variants, Freescale (formerly Motorola)
HC08 (hc08, s08), Zilog Z80 based MCUs (z80, z180, gbz80, Rabbit 2000/3000,
Rabbit 3000A, TLCS-90) and STMicroelectronics STM8.  Work is in progress
to support Microchip PIC16 and PIC18 targets.
