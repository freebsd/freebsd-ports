====
When you are to build a ruby related port for Ruby 1.7, please define
RUBY_VER=1.7 in the make command line, or put it in your
/etc/make.conf.  If you want to always use Ruby 1.7 instead of 1.6,
set RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.7.

Note that some stuff that comes with the standard Ruby distribution is
provided as separate ports:

	converters/ruby-iconv	iconv module

	databases/ruby-gdbm:	GDBM module

	lang/ruby-tcltklib:	Tcl/Tk libraries
	japanese/ruby-tcltklib:	Tcl/Tk libraries for Japanized Tcl/Tk

	x11-toolkits/ruby-tk:	Tk modules
	japanese/ruby-tk:	Tk modules for Japanized Tcl/Tk

	lang/ruby-mode.el:	Emacs lisp modules
			
Please install them as occasion demands. (Don't forget to define
RUBY_VER=1.7 when you build them)
