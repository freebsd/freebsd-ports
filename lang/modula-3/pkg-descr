This is a port of Modula-3 release 3.5.3, from DEC Systems Research
Center.  Modula-3 is a modern compiled programming language designed
for systems programming as well as large applications.  Some notable
features include:

    * A clean type system with good support for object-oriented
      programming.
    * A powerful module system.
    * Lightweight threads, fully integrated into the language and all of
      the libraries.
    * Generics.
    * Exceptions.
    * Automatic storage management by a multithreaded, incremental,
      generational garbage collector.
    * Guaranteed type safety, plus the ability to confine unsafe code
      behind safe interfaces.
    * Elegance and simplicity, even compared with less powerful
      languages such as C++ and Ada.
    * Ease of integration with existing C libraries.
    * A huge collection of runtime libraries, providing:
	- Text manipulation.
	- Generic containers (lists, sequences, tables, etc.).
	- Atoms and symbolic expressions.
	- An extensible stream I/O system.
	- Persistent objects.
	- Operating system interfaces.
	- Networking.
	- Very nice object-oriented graphics facilities, and some
	  convenient tools for building GUIs.
    * A convenient browser.

This port includes patches for a number of bugs found since the release
of DEC SRC's version 3.5.3.
