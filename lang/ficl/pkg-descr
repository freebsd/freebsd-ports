FICL is an extremely lightweight, fast, portable implementation of FORTH
which can be bound to C functions or even embedded within C/assembler
programs. This is a port for the current version of FICL. Older versions
can typically be found in /usr/src/sys/boot/ficl on FreeBSD with the
bindings needed by the OS loader.
