GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, supports a number of languages.  This
port installs the C, C++, Fortran and Java front ends as gcc48, g++48,
gfortran48, and gcj48, respectively.

It can be used interchangibly with the lang/gcc48 port which tracks
weekly upstream snapshots whereas this port will be updated less
frequently, mostly in sync with upstream releases, and will move to
lang/gcc49 and later over time.
