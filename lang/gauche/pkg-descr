Gauche is a fast, portable Scheme interpreter with "batteries included".
It conforms to the R5RS and R7RS language standards, supports lots of
SRFI out of the box, adds its own object-oriented programming framework,
and supports the R7RS library system as well as its own pre-R7RS module
system.  Gauche is designed for rapid development of scripts to assist
daily work in system administration, text processing, and other fields.
It can handle UTF-8, EUC-JP, and Shift JIS character strings natively.
