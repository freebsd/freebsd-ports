The Twelf implementation comprises

 * the LF logical framework, including type reconstruction;
 * the Elf constraint logic programming language;
 * an inductive meta-theorem prover for LF;
 * and an Emacs interface.

Twelf provides a uniform meta-language for specifying,
implementing, and proving properties of programming languages
and logics.  Example suites include Cartesian Closed Categories
and lambda-calculus, the Church-Rosser theorem for the untyped
lambda-calculus, Mini-ML including type preservation and
compilation, cut elimination, theory of logic programming,
and Hilbert's deduction theorem.
