NBC (Next Byte Codes) is a programming language for the LEGO
MINDSTORMS NXT product. NBC's syntax is based on assembler programming
languages, so experienced assembler programmers (or just about any
programmers) should find it very easy to get started with. Even if you
aren't an experienced programmer, NBC is relatively easy to learn.
