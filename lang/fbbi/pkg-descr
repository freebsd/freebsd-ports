The Flaming Bovine Befunge-98 Interpreter (FBBI) is an interpreter for
the Befunge-98 language as defined by the Funge-98 Final Specification,
written in 100% ANSI C.

Funge-98 is the most elaborate update so far of the Befunge language,
Funge-98 generalizes Befunge for one, two, or three dimensions, and
provides a paradigm for Funges of any number of dimensions and
topologies. It also provides arbitrary program flow direction on a
virtually limitless playfield, and a richer, scalable instruction set
with an optional Concurrent version for multithreading.

The Befunge programming language was created in 1993 by Chris Pressey
for the purpose of being original, entertaining, and hard-to-compile.

In most languages, control flow is restricted to one direction and one
dimension only: any instruction which does not perform an explicit jump
actually performs an implicit jump to the next instruction.

Befunge, however, allows execution to proceed in less restricted
fashion; the program is stored in a two-dimensional grid and control
can flow left or right, or up, or down...
