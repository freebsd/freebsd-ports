Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term
rewriting. It offers equational definitions with pattern matching, full
symbolic rewriting capabilities, dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation,
lexical closures, built-in list and matrix support and an easy-to-use C
interface. The interpreter uses LLVM as a backend to JIT-compile Pure
programs to fast native code.
