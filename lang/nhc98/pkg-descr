nhc98 is a fully-fledged compiler for Haskell 98, the standard lazy functional
programming language. Written in Haskell, it is small and very portable, and
aims to produce small executables that run in small amounts of memory. It comes
with extensive tool support for automatic compilation, foreign language
interfacing, heap and time profiling, tracing, and debugging.
