Squeak is a new implementation of the Smalltalk programming
environment; it includes among other things:
    * a rapid-turn-around Smalltalk-80 compiler,
    * a caching-JIT run-time virtual machine (with full source in
      Smalltalk),
    * large class libraries with portable data and GUI models, and
    * an integrated development environment with coding tools, GUI
      construction.

Squeak was developed at Apple Labs and Walt Disney and has been ported
to a variety of computers (including most flavors of UNIX and
Windows). Compared to other Smalltalk systems, Squeak has 4 important
features:
    * Portability (to Mac, Windows, WinCE, and many flavors of UNIX);
    * Speed (it uses native C for compute-intensive code);
    * Price (free, including all source code and the right to distribute
      applications!); and
    * Sophistication (full Smalltalk-80 language, libraries, and tools).
