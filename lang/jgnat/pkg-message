In any session you wish to use jgnat, you MUST set the PATH and
CLASSPATH environment variables correctly.

For example, if your PREFIX is /usr/local (the default) and you are
using /bin/sh, you should:

--Do nothing to the PATH as /usr/local/bin is already in the path;

--Set your CLASSPATH as follows:

	$CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/share/java/classes/jgnat.jar:$CLASSPATH
	$export CLASSPATH
