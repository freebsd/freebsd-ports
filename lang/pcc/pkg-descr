This compiler is based on the original Portable C Compiler by S. C. Johnson,
written in the late 70's.  Even though much of the compiler has been
rewritten, some of the basics still remain.  

The intention is to write a C99 compiler while still keeping it small, simple,
fast and understandable.  I think of it as if it shall be able to compile and
run on PDP11 (even if it may not happen in reality).  But with this in mind it
becomes important to think twice about what algorithms are used.
