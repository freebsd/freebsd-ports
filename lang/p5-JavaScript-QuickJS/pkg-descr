JavaScript::QuickJS embeds Fabrice Bellard's QuickJS engine into a Perl XS
module. You can thus run JavaScript (ES2020 specification) directly in your Perl
programs.

This distribution includes all needed C code; unlike with most XS modules that
interface with C libraries, you don't need QuickJS pre-installed on your system.
