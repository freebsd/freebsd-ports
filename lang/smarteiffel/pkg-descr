SmartEiffel The GNU Eiffel Compiler is a free open-source Eiffel
compiler distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation. It is a complete, small
and very fast, free Eiffel compiler.

It is available for a very wide range of platforms. In fact,
SmartEiffel should run on any platform for which an ANSI C - POSIX
compiler or a standard JVM exists.

The current distribution includes an Eiffel to C compiler, an Eiffel
to Java bytecode compiler, a documentation tool, a pretty printer and
various other tools, with their sources.  

SmartEiffel features an innovative strategy involving whole system
analysis which allows compilation to be often faster than the
incremental compilation of traditional compilers.
