Portable OpenCL (pocl)
----------------------

Portable OpenCL aims to be an efficient open source (MIT-licensed) 
implementation of the OpenCL 1.2 standard. 

In addition to producing an easily portable open source OpenCL
implementation, another major goal of the project is improving 
performance portability of OpenCL programs with compiler 
optimizations, reducing the need for target-dependent manual 
optimizations. At the core of pocl is a set of LLVM passes 
used to statically parallelize multiple work-items with the kernel
compiler, even in the presence of work-group barriers. This enables 
parallelization of the fine-grained static concurrency in the work 
groups in multiple ways (SIMD, VLIW, superscalar,...).

The code base is modularized to allow easy adding of new "device drivers"
in the host-device layer. A generic multithreaded "target driver" is 
included. It allows running OpenCL applications on a host that supports 
the pthread library with multithreading at the work group granularity.
