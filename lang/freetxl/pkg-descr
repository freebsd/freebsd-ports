TXL is a unique programming language specifically designed to support computer
software analysis and source transformation tasks. It is the evolving result
of more than fifteen years of concentrated research on rule-based structural
transformation as a paradigm for the rapid solution of complex computing
problems.

The TXL programming language is a hybrid functional / rule-based language with
unification, implied iteration and deep pattern match.

Each TXL program has two components:

 * A Description of the Structures to be Transformed
   Specified as an EBNF grammar, in context-free ambiguous form.
 
 * A Set of Structural Transformation Rules
   Specified by example, using pattern/replacement pairs.
