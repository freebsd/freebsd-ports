Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing
smart contracts. It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and
is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and
complex user-defined types among other features.

It is possible to create contracts for voting, crowdfunding,
blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more.
