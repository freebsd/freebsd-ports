Nim (formerly known as "Nimrod") is a statically typed, imperative
programming language that tries to give the programmer ultimate power
without compromises on runtime efficiency. This means it focuses on
compile-time mechanisms in all their various forms.

Beneath a nice infix/indentation based syntax with a powerful (AST
based, hygienic) macro system lies a semantic model that supports a soft
realtime GC on thread local heaps. Asynchronous message passing is used
between threads, so no "stop the world" mechanism is necessary. An unsafe
shared memory heap is also provided for the increased efficiency that
results from that model.
