execline is a very light non-interactive scripting language,
which is similar to /bin/sh. Simple shell scripts can be
easily rewritten in the execline language, improving performance
and memory usage. execline was designed for use
in embedded systems, but works on most Unix flavors.

execline features conditional loops, getopt-style option handling,
filename globbing, and more.  Meanwhile, its syntax
is far more logical and predictable than the shell's syntax,
and has no security issues.
