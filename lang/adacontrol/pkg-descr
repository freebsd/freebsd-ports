AdaControl is a free (GMGPL) tool that detects the use of various kinds of
constructs in Ada programs. Its first goal is to control proper usage of
style or programming rules, but it can also be used as a powerful tool to
search for use (or non-use) of various forms of programming styles or design
patterns. Searched elements range from very simple, like the occurrence of
certaine entities, declarations, or statements, to very sophisticated, like
verifying that certain programming patterns are being obeyed..

Which elements or constructs are searched is defined by a set of rules; the
following table gives a short summary of rules currently checked by
AdaControl. The number in parentheses after the rule name gives the number
of subrules, if any. Considering all possible rules and subrules, this makes
452 tests that can be performed currently by AdaControl!
