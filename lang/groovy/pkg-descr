Groovy is an agile dynamic language for the Java 2 Platform that has many of
the features that people like so much in languages like Python, Ruby and
Smalltalk, making them available to Java developers using a Java-like syntax.

Groovy is designed to help you get things done on the Java 2 Platform in a
quick, concise and fun way. Groovy brings the power of a scripting language
directly into the Java 2 Platform. For example:

- Shell scripting using Groovy allows the full power of the Java Platform to be
  brought to bear to the task at hand.
- Groovy can be used (and indeed is already being used) as a replacement for
  Java for small and medium sized applications to execute on the Java 2
  Platform.
- Groovy can be used as an embedded language for dynamic business rules or
  extension points utilizing the agility of Groovy and saving the cost of
  redeploying applications for each change of rule (especially when the rules
  are stored in a database).
- Groovy makes writing test cases for unit tests very easy.

As well as being a powerful language for scripting Java objects, Groovy can be
used as an alternative compiler to javac to generate standard Java bytecode to
be used by any Java project.
