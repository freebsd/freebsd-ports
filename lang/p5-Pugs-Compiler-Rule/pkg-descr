This module provides an implementation for Perl 6 Rules.

It is a front-end to several other modules:
   * Pugs::Grammar::Rule parses the Rules syntax.
   * Pugs::Grammar::Rule::Rule specifies the Rules syntax with Rules.
   * Pugs::Emitter::Rule::Perl5 converts parsed Rules to Perl 5 code.
   * Pugs::Runtime::Rule provides the runtime engine for Rules.
   * Pugs::Runtime::Match represents a Match object.
