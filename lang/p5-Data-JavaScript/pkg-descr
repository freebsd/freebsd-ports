This module is aimed mainly for CGI programming, when a perl script
generates a page with client side JavaScript code that needs access to
structures created on the server.

It works by creating one line of JavaScript code per datum. Therefore,
structures cannot be created anonymously and needed to be assigned to
variables. This enables dumping big structures.
