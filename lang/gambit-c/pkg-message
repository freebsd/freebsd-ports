======================================================================

Because the usual name of Gambit-C's compiler clashes with
ghostscript, the interpreter and compiler have been renamed
"gsi-gambit" and "gsc-gambit" respectively.

However, documentation is still accessible through "man gsi" or
"info gambit-c"
