D is a systems programming language. Its focus is on combining the power and
high performance of C and C++ with the programmer productivity of modern
languages like Ruby and Python. Special attention is given to the needs of
quality assurance, documentation, management, portability and reliability.

The D language is statically typed and compiles directly to machine code. It's
multiparadigm, supporting many programming styles: imperative, object oriented,
and metaprogramming. It's a member of the C syntax family, and its appearance
is very similar to that of C++.

It is not governed by a corporate agenda or any overarching theory of
programming. The needs and contributions of the D programming community form
the direction it goes.
