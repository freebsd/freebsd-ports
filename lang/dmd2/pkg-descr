D is a systems programming language. Its focus is on combining the power and
high performance of C and C++ with the programmer productivity of modern
languages like Ruby and Python. Special attention is given to the needs of
quality assurance, documentation, management, portability and reliability.

The D language is statically typed and compiles directly to machine code. It's
multiparadigm, supporting many programming styles: imperative, object oriented,
and metaprogramming. It's a member of the C syntax family, and its appearance
is very similar to that of C++.

It is not governed by a corporate agenda or any overarching theory of
programming. The needs and contributions of the D programming community form
the direction it goes.

This is an unofficial port that compiles directly from source, so it has not
been officially validated or tested on the FreeBSD platform by the developer.
