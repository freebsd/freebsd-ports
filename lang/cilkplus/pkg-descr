Intel Cilk Plus is an extension to the C and C++ languages to support data 
and task parallelism.

Primary Features

High Performance:
    * An efficient work-stealing scheduler provides nearly optimal 
	scheduling of parallel tasks
    * Vector support unlocks the performance that's been hiding in your 
	processors
    * Powerful hyperobjects allow for lock-free programming
Easy to Learn:
    * Only 3 new keywords to implement task parallelism
    * Serial semantics make understanding and debugging the parallel 
	program easier
    *Array Notations provide a natural way to express data parallelism
Easy to Use:
    * Automatic load balancing provides good behavior in multi-programmed 
	environments
    * Existing algorithms easily adapted for parallelism with minimal 
	modification
    * Supports both C and C++ programmers
