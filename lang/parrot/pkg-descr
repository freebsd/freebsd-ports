Parrot is the new interpreter being designed from scratch to support the
upcoming Perl6 language.  It is being designed as a standalone virtual
machine that can be used to execute bytecode compiled dynamic languages
such as Perl6, but also Perl5.  Ideally, Parrot can be used to support
other dynamic, bytecode-compiled languages such as Python, Ruby and Tcl.
