0.99.4 release of ``The Macro Implementation of SNOBOL4 in C''

This is a free port of the original SIL (SNOBOL4 Implementation
Language) macro version of SNOBOL4 (developed at Bell Labs) with
the C language as target, http://www.snobol4.com/snobol4-0.99.4.tar.gz.

SNOBOL4, while known primarily as a string language excels at any
task involving symbolic manipulations.  It provides run time typing,
garbage collection, user data types, on the fly compilation.  Its
primary weakness is its simple syntax, and lack of "structured
programming" constructs.  However some consider the spareness of
SNOBOL4 syntax a strength when compared to some "modern" agglomerations
such as perl.
