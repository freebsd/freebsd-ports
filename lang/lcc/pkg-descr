lcc is the retargetable ANSI C compiler described in the book
`A Retargetable C Compiler: Design and Implementation'
(Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-8053-1670-1).

lcc is a production compiler with a hand crafted lexical analyzer and a
hand-coded recursive decent parser.  The lexer and parser code is well
written and very easy to read (and learn from :-)).

lcc compiles much faster than FreeBSD's stock [gcc] compiler.  However, it
does not under stand FreeBSD's "long long" data type.
