Seed7 is an extensible general purpose programming language designed by Thomas
Mertes. It is a higher level language compared to Ada, C/C++ and Java.
In Seed7 new statements and operators can be declared easily. Functions with
type results and type parameters are more elegant than a template or generics
concept. Object orientation is used where it brings advantages and not in
places where other solutions are more obvious. Although Seed7 contains several
concepts from other programming languages, it is generally not considered a
direct descendant of any other programming language. 

Major features include:

- user defined statements and operators,
- abstract data types,
- templates without special syntax,
- OO with interfaces and multiple dispatch,
- statically typed,
- interpreted or compiled,
- portable,
- runs under Linux/Unix/Windows.
