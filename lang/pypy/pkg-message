Note that some standard Python modules are provided as separate ports
as they require additional dependencies. They are available as:

gdbm            databases/pypy-gdbm
sqlite3         databases/pypy-sqlite3
tkinter         x11-toolkits/pypy-tkinter

Note that PyPy does not implement the following module that would
have been provided as a separate port:

bsddb           databases/pypy-bsddb
