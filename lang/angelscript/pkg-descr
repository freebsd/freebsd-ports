The AngelCode Scripting Library, or AngelScript as it is also known, is an
extremely flexible cross-platform scripting library designed to allow
applications to extend their functionality through external scripts. It has
been designed from the beginning to be an easy to use component, both for
the application programmer and the script writer.

Efforts have been made to let it call standard C functions and C++ methods
with little to no need for proxy functions. The application simply registers
the functions, objects, and methods that the scripts should be able to work
with and nothing more has to be done with your code. The same functions used
by the application internally can also be used by the scripting engine, which
eliminates the need to duplicate functionality.

For the script writer the scripting language follows the widely known syntax
of C/C++, but without the need to worry about pointers and memory leaks.
Contrary to most scripting languages, AngelScript uses the common C/C++
datatypes for more efficient communication with the host application.
