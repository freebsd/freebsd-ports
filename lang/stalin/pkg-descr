Stalin (STAtic Language ImplementatioN) is an aggressive optimizing batch
whole-program Scheme compiler written by Jeffrey Mark Siskind.  It uses
advanced flow analysis and type inference and a variety of other optimization
techniques to produce code (using C as an intermediate language) that is
extremely fast, particularly for numerical code.  In a number of tests it
has outperformed hand-written C, sometimes by a considerable margin.
Stalin is intended for production use in generating an optimized executable.
