tcbasic implements a small subset of BASIC known as Tiny BASIC
with added support for floating point numbers and many of the
built-in mathematical functions in Dartmouth BASIC. It supports
basic I/O, flow control, subroutines, and debug tracing.

The small size of the language make it easy to learn and master
while providing all of the building blocks needed to develop many
interesting programs. tcbasic runs on a variety of platforms and
aims to be as portable as possible.
