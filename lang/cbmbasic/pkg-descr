Commodore BASIC (cbmbasic) is a 100% compatible version of Commodore's
version of Microsoft BASIC 6502 as found on the Commodore 64.

You can use cbmbasic in interactive mode by just running the binary
without parameters, or you can specify an ASCII-encoded BASIC program
on the command line. You can also use cbmbasic as a UNIX scripting
language by adding a hashbang line to your BASIC program and making
it executable.
