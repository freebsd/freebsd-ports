====
Some of the standard commands are provided as separate ports for ease
of upgrading:

	devel/ruby-gems:	gem - RubyGems package manager
	devel/rubygem-rake:	rake - Ruby Make

And some of the standard libraries are provided as separate ports
since they require extra dependencies:

	databases/ruby-gdbm:	GDBM module

Install them as occasion demands.
