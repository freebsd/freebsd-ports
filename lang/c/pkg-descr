Tool to compile and run C programs like a shell script.

First of all, this is not the same as tcc. TCC is a compiler. TCC will perform
its own set of optimizations, just as GCC will perform its own and Clang will
perform its own. The purpose of this script is to give a simple front-end to a
compiler.

Whether it's GCC, Clang, or something else entirely, one can get to choose
their compiler. It's simply satisfying to type c hello.c and see it run
instantly.

C is fast. Being able to write a small, fast, and portable C "script" is great.
One can pass around a C "script" just like s/he would a BASH script.
