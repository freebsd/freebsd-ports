SketchyLISP is a small, tail-recursive, lexically scoped
interpreter for a purely applicative dialect of Scheme.
It may be considered an implementation of pure LISP plus
global definitions (DEFINE) and first-class continuations
(CALL/CC).

This package contains the SketchyLISP interpreter and library,
the reference manual, and example programs.
