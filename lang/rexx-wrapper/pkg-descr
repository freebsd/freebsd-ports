Rexx/Wrapper is a tool that wraps Rexx source or tokenised code into an
executable. The Rexx source code can be optionally compressed and encoded to
ensure that the original Rexx code cannot be viewed (unless you have the
original encryption key).

To use Rexx/Wrapper you need two extra bits of software:
   1. A supported Rexx interpreter
   2. A supported C compiler
