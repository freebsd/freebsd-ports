The Kross scripting framework provides full Python, Ruby and KDE JavaScript
scripting support. The goal was to limit the work needed on applications to
have them fully scriptable and to provide a modular way to transparently
integrate additional interpreters and in that way extend your application
with a new scripting-backend without any new line of code and even without
any recompile. To achieve this internally Qt's introspection-functionality
like signals, slots, properties, enums, QVariant, QObject, QMetaObject,
QMetaType, etc. are used to deal with functionality at runtime.
