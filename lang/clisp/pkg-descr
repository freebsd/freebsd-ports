Common Lisp is a high-level, all-purpose, object-oriented, dynamic,
functional programming language.

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe
University and Michael Stoll of Munich University, both in Germany. It   
mostly supports the Lisp described in the ANSI Common Lisp standard. 

CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a large subset of CLOS, a 
foreign language interface and a socket interface. An X11 interface is   
available through CLX and Garnet. Command line editing is provided by
readline.

CLISP is free software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU 
GPL. You may distribute commercial applications compiled with CLISP, 
see file COPYRIGHT in the CLISP distribution.

The user interface comes in German, English, French and Spanish, and 
can be changed at run time.
