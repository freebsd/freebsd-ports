==============================================================================

Emacs and Vim editing facilities for CLISP were installed into:
%%DATADIR%%

And you will have to symlink/copy the files to the corresponding directories.
For global installation:

Emacs:	%%PREFIX%%/share/emacs/site-lisp
Vim:	$VIMRUNTIME/vimfiles/after/syntax

Alternatively you may do per-user installations.
