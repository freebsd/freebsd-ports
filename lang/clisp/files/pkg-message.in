  message: <<EOM
To work with Common Lisp ports, create ~/.clisprc with this line:
(load "%%PREFIX%%/etc/cl-freebsd-asdf-init.lisp")

Emacs and Vim editing facilities for CLISP were installed into:
%%DATADIR%%

And you will have to symlink/copy the files to the corresponding directories.
For global installation:

Emacs:	%%PREFIX%%/share/emacs/site-lisp
Vim:	$VIMRUNTIME/vimfiles/after/syntax

Alternatively you may do per-user installations.
