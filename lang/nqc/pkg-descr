A compiler for a simple language for programming the LEGO RCX or CyberMaster
controllers. The language itself is "Not Quite C" and includes preprocessor
and control structures very similar to the C language, but with restrictions
imposed by the limitations of the RCX hardware/firmware itself.

Besides compiling, nqc also provides functions for downloading the RCX
firmware as well as uploading programs to and downloading from the RCX.

The NQC home page includes documentation for the language itself including
examples.
