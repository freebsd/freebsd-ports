tolua++ is an extended version of tolua, a tool to integrate C/C++ code 
with Lua. tolua++ includes new features oriented to c++ such as:

* Support for std::string as a basic type (this can be turned off by a 
  command line option).
* Support for class templates

As well as other features and bugfixes.

tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++ code with 
Lua. Based on a cleaned header file (or extracts from real header files), 
tolua automatically generates the binding code to access C/C++ features 
from Lua. Using Lua API and tag method facilities, tolua maps C/C++ 
constants, external variables, functions, classes, and methods to Lua.
