tolua++ is an extended version of tolua, a tool to integrate C/C++ code
with Lua. tolua++ includes new features oriented to c++ such as:

* Support for std::string as a basic type (this can be turned off by a
  command line option).
* Support for class templates

As well as other features and bugfixes.

tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++ code with
Lua. Based on a cleaned header file (or extracts from real header files),
tolua automatically generates the binding code to access C/C++ features
from Lua. Using Lua API and tag method facilities, tolua maps C/C++
constants, external variables, functions, classes, and methods to Lua.
