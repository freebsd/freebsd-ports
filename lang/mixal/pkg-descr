Mixal is a version the assembler and interpreter for Donald Knuth's
mythical MIX computer, defined in:

   Donald E. Knuth, _The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 1: Fundamental
   Algorithms_.  Addison-Wesley, 1973 (2nd ed.)


This preliminary release doesn't do floating point and has little
documentation as yet, but it works well enough to be used in conjunction
with the book.
