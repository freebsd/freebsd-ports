libHX is a C library (with some additional C++ bindings available)
that provides data structures and functions for tasks common in scripting
languages; autoresizing string manipulation, maps, deques, option parsing,
type-checking casts and more.

libHX aids in quickly writing up C/C++ data processing programs,
by consolidating tasks that often happen to be open-coded, such as
config file reading, option parsing, directory traversal, and others,
into a library. The focus is on reducing the amount of time (and
secondarily, the amount of code) a developer has to spend for otherwise
implementing such. Subsequently, proficient coders can use this to
code as fast as for a scripting language.
