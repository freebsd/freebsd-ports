************************************************************************
If you have build/runtime errors with Mono and Gtk# apps please try the
following first:

* Build Mono and gtk+ (x11-toolkits/gtk20) without CPUTYPE and with the
  default FreeBSD CFLAGS as Mono has been known to expose compiler bugs.
  - 5.x:		'-O -pipe'
  - 6.x and higher:	'-O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe'

* Try building and running Mono with the GENERIC kernel.
  - Mono requires SYSVSHM, SYSVMSG, and SYSVSEM which are part of the
    GENERIC kernel.
  - Removing kernel options or changing defaults to use experimental
    options can adversely affect Mono's ability to build and run.

* Remove leftover semaphores / increase semaphore limits.
  - Close apps which use Mono and run `ipcs -sbt`.  Remove the
    semaphores with MODE "--rw-------" and NSEMS "8"
  - _OR_ simply reboot which is the safest method.
  - On multi-user systems the semaphore limits may need to be increased
    from the FreeBSD default of 10 identifiers and 60 total semaphores.
    The following should comfortably support 30 users.

    # echo "kern.ipc.semmni=40" >> /boot/loader.conf
    # echo "kern.ipc.semmns=300" >> /boot/loader.conf

    By users we mean local users.  XSP can serve multiple clients but
    would count as only one user, the user running XSP.
