GPTScript is a new scripting language to automate your interaction with a Large
Language Model (LLM), namely OpenAI. The ultimate goal is to create a natural
language programming experience. The syntax of GPTScript is largely natural
language, making it very easy to learn and use. Natural language prompts can be
mixed with traditional scripts such as bash and python or even external HTTP
service calls. With GPTScript you can do just about anything, like plan a
vacation, edit a file, run some SQL, or build a mongodb/flask app. Here are
some common use cases for GPTScript:

  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Task Automation
  - Agents and Assistants
  - Data Analysis
  - Vision, Image, and Audio
  - Memory Management
  - Chatbots
