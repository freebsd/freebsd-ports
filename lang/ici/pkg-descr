ICI is a C-like, high level language originally developed by Tim Long
and placed into the public domain. ICI marries C's expression syntax,
control structures and overall feel, with a dynamic, garbage
collected, object-based, data model. Version 4 incorporates numerous
performance enhancements, refinements to existing features and new
features including native support for threads, a cleaner, more well
defined API for extension module authors and those embedding ICI
within other programs, and new documentation that is superior to
that provided in previous releases.

ICI is typically used as a scripting-like language in the fashion of
Perl, Python, Ruby, Lua, TCL and other such languages.  ICI can be
called from C and the language itself can be extended allowing
applications to provide domain specific functions, types and
operators for use in their ICI programs. Embedding within applications
allows application authors to make use of ICI's efficient object
system which provides many useful facilities.

ICI is in the public domain, there is no copyright on it.
