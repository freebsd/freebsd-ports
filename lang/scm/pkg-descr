Scm conforms to Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme and the IEEE
P1178 specification.  Scm is written in C and runs under Amiga, Atari-ST, MacOS,
MS-DOS, OS/2, NOS/VE, Unicos, VMS, Unix and similar systems.  ASCII and EBCDIC
are supported.

Documentation is included explaining the many Scheme Language extensions in scm,
the internal representation and how to extend or include scm in other programs.

SLIB is a portable Scheme library which SCM uses.

SLIB-PSD is a portable debugger for Scheme (requires emacs editor).

The init file is hard-coded as /usr/local/share/scm/Init.scm.  Alternatively,
one can set the environment variable SCM_INIT_PATH to the pathname of Init.scm.

The library files are in /usr/local/share/scm/slib.  Alternatively, one can set
the environment variable SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH to the slib directory.  Remember to
use a trailing / on the pathname.

By default -DSICP is turned on, with the expectation that this is the major
reason for this port.  This means test.scm will fail on three tests in section
6.1.  Where strict R4S compliance is important, recompile without the SICP flag.
