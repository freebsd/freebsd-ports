Scm conforms to Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme
and the IEEE P1178 specification.  Scm is written in C and runs under
Amiga, Atari-ST, MacOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, NOS/VE, Unicos, VMS, Unix and
similar systems.  ASCII and EBCDIC are supported.

Documentation is included explaining the many Scheme Language
extensions in scm, the internal representation and how to extend or
include scm in other programs.

SLIB is a portable Scheme library which SCM uses.

SLIB-PSD is a portable debugger for Scheme (requires emacs editor).

1.  Pathname dependencies:
	The init file is hardcoded as /usr/local/share/scm/Init.scm.
	Alternatively, one can set the environment variable SCM_INIT_PATH to
	the pathname of Init.scm.

	The library files are in /usr/local/share/scm/slib.  Alternatively,
	one can set the environment variable SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH to
	the slib directory.  Remember to use a trailing / on the
	pathname.

2.  I have -DSICP turn on by default, since I expect this to be the major
reason for this port.  This means test.scm will fail on 3 tests in section 6.1.
If strict R4S compliance is important to you, recompile w/o the SICP flag.
