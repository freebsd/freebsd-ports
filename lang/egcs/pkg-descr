Egcs (pronounced "eggs") is an enhanced version of the GNU compiler
suite, including gcc, g++, and g77.  Egcs is based on a recent
snapshot of the gcc-2.8 development sources; it contains nearly
all of the new features found in gcc-2.8.  Egcs also contains many
improvements and features not found in gcc-2.7 and even the soon to be
released gcc-2.8 compilers.  C++ support, and in particular template
support, is vastly improved over gcc-2.7.

Beware: This port installs new versions of "gcc", "g++", "c++" and
so forth into the "${PREFIX}/bin" directory.  Mind your PATHs if you
don't want to use this compiler by default.
