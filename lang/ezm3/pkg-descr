Ezm3 is a smaller, more portable distribution of the Modula-3 compiler
and runtime system for people whose only need for Modula-3 is to build
CVSup.  It supports all features of CVSup, but has smaller distfiles
and installs more quickly than other versions of Modula-3.  Ezm3
provides full X11 GUI support even when compiled on systems which
do not have X11 installed.  It links programs statically with the
Modula-3 libraries but dynamically with the system libraries, so that
programs built with Ezm3 can run on systems which do not have
Modula-3 installed on them.
