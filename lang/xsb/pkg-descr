XSB is a Logic Programming and Deductive Database system for Unix and
Windows. It is being developed at The Computer Science Department,
SUNY Stony Brook (http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/), in collaboration with
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (http://www.kuleuven.ac.be/),
Universidade Nova de Lisboa (http://www.unl.pt/), and Uppsala
Universitet (http://www.uu.se/).

One innovation of XSB is its use of tabled resolution.  Tabled
resolution is useful for recursive query computation, allowing
programs to terminate correctly in many cases where Prolog does
not. Users interested in Parsing, Program Analysis, Model-checking,
Data Mining and Diagnosis may benefit from XSB.
