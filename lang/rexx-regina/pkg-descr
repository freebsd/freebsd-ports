Regina is a Rexx interpreter that has been ported to most Unix platforms
(Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc.) and also to OS/2, eCS, DOS,
Win9x/Me/NT/2k/XP, Amiga, AROS, QNX, BeOS, MacOS X, EPOC32, AtheOS, OpenVMS
and OpenEdition. Rexx is a programming language that was designed to be easy
to use for inexperienced programmers yet powerful enough for experienced
users. It is also a language ideally suited as a macro language for other
applications.

There are two major goals for Regina:
    * become 100% compliant with the ANSI Standard.
    * be available on as many platforms as possible.
