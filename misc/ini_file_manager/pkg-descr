The Ini file manager consists of a package, Config, which can read or write
informations from various configuration files known as "ini" files because
they have often the ".ini" extension. They are text files which look like
the following:

  ; Comment line
  [Section 1]
  a_string = abcd     # a comment here...
  a_number = +123.456 ; another comment
  [Section 2]
  a_string = efgh

For more examples in this format, just search files with the .ini extension
on a Windows-based computer.
