SoapySDR is an open-source generalized C/C++ API and runtime library for
interfacing with SDR devices. With SoapySDR, you can instantiate, configure,
and stream with an SDR device in a variety of environments. Both osmosdr and
uhd devices are available within SoapySDR. In addition, vendors can directly
support their hardware using SoapySDR device modules. There are wrappers for
both gr-osmosdr, uhd, and gr-uhd to bring an ecosystem of existing applications
to SoapySDR devices. And SoapySDR has support for powerful platforms like GNU
Radio and Pothos.
