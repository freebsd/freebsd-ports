Sort files or its standard input using the bogo-sort algorithm
described in the Jargon File <http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/>.

A quote from the Jargon File 'bogo-sort' entry:

     ...The archetypical perversely awful algorithm (as opposed to
     _bubble sort_, which is merely the generic bad algorithm).
     _Bogo-sort_ is equivalent to repeatedly throwing a deck of cards
     in the air, picking them up at random, and then testing whether
     they are in order. It serves as a sort of canonical example of
     awfulness. Looking at a program and seeing a dumb algorithm, one
     might say "Oh, I see, this program uses _bogo-sort_." Esp.
     appropriate for algorithms with factorial or super-exponential
     running time in the average case and probabilistically infinite
     worst-case running time. Compare _bogus_, _brute force_,
     _lasherism_...
