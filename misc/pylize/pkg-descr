pylize is a presentation generation tool. Among its features are:
    * generates a template master document
    * creates a set of HTML slides from the master document
    * automatically creates the table of contents and distributes it to
      serveral slides if necessary
    * a nice CSS driven slide layout, including logo, navigation links,
      progress-bar etc.
    * easy navigation by accesskeys and single-key presses (through JavaScript)
    * easy changing of layout through templates
    * all information for a presentation in one master file, but configurable
      through a per-user options file
    * fully localized
