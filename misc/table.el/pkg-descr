Table.el is an Emacs lisp package that extends Emacs and provides text
based table creation and editing feature. With this package Emacs is
capable of editing tables that are embedded inside a document, the
feature similar to the ones seen in modern WYSIWYG word processors. A
table is a rectangular text area consisting from a surrounding frame
and content inside the frame. The content is usually subdivided into
multiple rectangular cells, see the actual tables used below in this
document. Once a table is recognized, editing operation inside a table
cell is confined into that specific cell's rectangular area. This
means that typing and deleting characters inside a cell do not affect
any outside text but introduces appropriate formatting only to the
cell contents. If necessary for accommodating added text in the cell,
the cell automatically grows vertically and/or horizontally.
