With xenmenu, users have an easy-to-understand yet flexable menu
programming language with which to create pleasing menus quickly
and easily.  These menus, stored as plain ASCII files, can be
modified on the fly and reinstalled without having to recompile
anything or halting xenmenu while reconfiguring.  Xenmenu can 
also be used as a secure user shell.
