ONNX Runtime is a cross-platform inference and training machine-learning
accelerator.

ONNX Runtime inference can enable faster customer experiences and lower costs,
supporting models from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and
TensorFlow/Keras as well as classical machine learning libraries such as
scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc. ONNX Runtime is compatible with different
hardware, drivers, and operating systems, and provides optimal performance by
leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable alongside graph optimizations
and transforms.

ONNX Runtime training can accelerate the model training time on multi-node
NVIDIA GPUs for transformer models with a one-line addition for existing PyTorch
training scripts.
