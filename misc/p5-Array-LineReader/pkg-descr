Array::LineReader gives you the possibility to access lines of some file by
the elements of an array. This modul inherites methods from Tie::Array (see
Tie::Array). You save a lot of memory, because the file's content is read
only on demand, i.e. in the case you access an element of the array. The
offset and length of all the lines is hold in memory as long as you tie your
array.
