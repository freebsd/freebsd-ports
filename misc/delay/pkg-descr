Delay is a program that counts down the number of seconds specified 
on its command line.
In this way, it's sort of like the standard sleep(1) command, except 
for the fact that it provides feedback of the time remaining.

With version 1.2 you can also 'delay' until a given time specification.
Here some usage example:

delay 1d 2:03:04.5
delay 1d 2h 3m 4.5s
delay 93785.5
delay until 4 pm
delay until noon tomorrow
delay until midnight 13 september 2000
delay until now + 5 minutes

It allows for short, long, and customized messages for the display of 
the time remaining.
