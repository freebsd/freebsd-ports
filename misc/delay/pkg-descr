Delay is a program that counts down the number of seconds specified
on its command line.
In this way, it's sort of like the standard sleep(1) command, except
for the fact that it provides feedback of the time remaining.

Here some usage example:
delay 1d 2:03:04.5
delay 1d 2h 3m 4.5s
delay 93785.5
delay until 4 pm -- cdplay
delay until noon tomorrow
delay until midnight 4 october 2003
delay until now +5 minutes
delay 15s -- top

It allows for short, long, and customized messages for the display of
the time remaining.
- example of output : delay -v until 4 pm tomorrow
		      Time Remaining: 1 days, 07:51:39.
