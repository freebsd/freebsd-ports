LifeLines is an advanced genealogical system. You can store any kind
and any amount of data in a LifeLines database, and you can process
and generate output based on that data in any way and in any format.

LifeLines supports GEDCOM; it imports and exports GEDCOM data.

LifeLines has a unique approach to report generation. LifeLines has
no built-in reports. Instead all reports are generated using report
programs that are written in a report programming language.

Because of its flexibility and programmability, LifeLines is frequently
used for genealogy applications on the World Wide Web.
