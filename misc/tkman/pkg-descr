A manual page reader, TkMan offers two major advantages over xman:
hypertext links to other man pages (click on a word in the text which
corresponds to a man page, and you jump there), and better navigation
within long man pages with searches (both incremental and regular
expression) and jumps to section headers.  TkMan also offers some
convenience features, like a user-configurable list of commonly used man
pages, a one-click printout, and integration of `whatis' and `apropos'.
Further, one may highlight, as if with a yellow marker, arbitrary passages
of text in man pages and subsequently jump directly to these passages by
selecting an identifying excerpt from a pulldown menu.  Finally, TkMan
gives one control over the directory-to-menu volume mapping of man pages
with a capability similar to but superior to xman's mandesc in that rather
than forcing all who share a man directory to follow a single organization,
TkMan gives control to the individual.  In fact, one may decide he has no
use for a large set of man pages--say for instance the programmer routines
in volumes 2, 3, 4, 8--and eliminate them from his personal database.
