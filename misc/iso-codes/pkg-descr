This project provides lists of various ISO standards (e.g. country, language,
language scripts, and currency names) in one place, rather than repeated in many
programs throughout the system.

Currently there are lists of languages and countries embedded in several
different programs, which leads to dozens of lists of 200 languages, translated
into more than 90 languages ... not very efficient.

With this project, we create a single "gettext domain" for every supported ISO
standard which contains the translations of that domain. It is easy for a
programmer to re-use those translations instead of maintaining their own
translation infrastructure. Moreover, the programmer does not need to follow
changes in the ISO standard and will not work with outdated information.
