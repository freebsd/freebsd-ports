KoboldCpp is an easy-to-use AI text-generation software for GGML and GGUF
models, inspired by the original KoboldAI. It's a single self-contained
distributable from Concedo, that builds off llama.cpp, and adds a versatile
KoboldAI API endpoint, additional format support, Stable Diffusion image
generation, speech-to-text, backward compatibility, as well as a fancy UI with
persistent stories, editing tools, save formats, memory, world info, author's
note, characters, scenarios and everything KoboldAI and KoboldAI Lite have to
offer.
