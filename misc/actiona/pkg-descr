Actiona is a task automation tool. It allows you to create and execute action
lists.

Users don't need to know any programming language to use it: its intuitive
interface allows to create action lists (scripts) using drag & drop.

Advanced users can use JavaScript (EcmaScript) to extend its functionality.
