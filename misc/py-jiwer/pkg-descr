JiWER is a simple and fast python package to evaluate an automatic speech
recognition system. It supports the following measures:
* word error rate (WER)
* match error rate (MER)
* word information lost (WIL)
* word information preserved (WIP)
* character error rate (CER)

These measures are computed with the use of the minimum-edit distance between
one or more reference and hypothesis sentences. The minimum-edit distance is
calculated using RapidFuzz, which uses C++ under the hood, and is therefore
faster than a pure python implementation.
