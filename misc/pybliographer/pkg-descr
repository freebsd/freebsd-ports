Pybliographer is a tool for handling databases of bibliographic references.
It provides an homogeneous interface (with powerful editing and searching
features) for several bibliographic database formats - currently supported
are BibTeX, Medline, Ovid and Refer.  In addition, it can export references
directly to LyX.

Both a scriptable command-line interface ("pybliographer") and a GNOME-
compliant GUI ("pybliographic") are installed by the port.

Pybliographer is written in Python, and some Python knowledge would be
helpful in making the most of the command-line environment and when doing
advanced searches.  The GUI version, on the other hand, is extremely novice-
friendly.
