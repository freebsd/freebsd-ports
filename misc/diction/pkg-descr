This is the GNU diction and style, free implementations of old standard
unix commands.  For some reason, many modern systems lack them.  Diction
prints wordy and commonly misused phrases.  Style analyses surface
characteristics of a document, e.g. sentence length and various
readability measures.

Both commands support English and German documents.
