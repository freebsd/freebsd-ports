The utility allows you to download firmware into and upload firmware from
the memory of a Cypress EZ-USB/FX2/FX3 chips. It is a de facto standard
for programming this family of devices.

This port is based on original fxload(8) program available from Linux
Hotplug Project. Libusb support has been provided to correctly work on
FreeBSD and patches for the FX3 have been merged in.
