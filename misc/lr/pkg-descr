Lazyread is a C program that auto-scrolls files on your screen 
in movie credit fashion. It allows the user to read without having 
to manually scroll down to see new pages. There are lots of 
features, such as being able to choose the speed at which it 
scrolls, pause, dynamic speed up, the ability to highlight lines 
that contain a specified string, and much more.
