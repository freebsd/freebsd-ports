To run ollama, plese open 2 terminals.

   $ ollama start
2. In the second terminal, please run:
   $ ollama run mistral

This will download and run the AI model "mistral".
You will be able to interact with it in plain English.

Please see https://ollama.com/library for the list
of all supported models.

ollama uses many gigbytes of disk space in your home directory,
because advanced AI models are often very large.
Pease symlink ~/.ollama to a large disk if needed.
