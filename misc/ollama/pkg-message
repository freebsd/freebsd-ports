You installed ollama: the AI model runner.

To run ollama, plese open 2 terminals.
1. In the first terminal, please run:
   $ OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1 OLLAMA_DEBUG=1 LLAMA_DEBUG=1 ollama start
2. In the second terminal, please run:
   $ ollama run gemma3
   or
   $ ollama run mistral

This will download and run the specified AI model.
You will be able to interact with it in plain English.

Please see https://ollama.com/library for the list
of all supported models.

The command "ollama list" lists all models downloaded
into your system.

When the model fails to load into your GPU, please use
the provided ollama-limit-gpu-layers script to create
model flavors with different num_gpu parameters.

ollama uses many gigabytes of disk space in your home directory,
because advanced AI models are often very large.
Please symlink ~/.ollama to a large disk if needed.
