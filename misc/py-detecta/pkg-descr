detecta is a Python module to detect events in data.

The following functions are implemented in detecta:
* detect_peaks.py: detects peaks in data based on their amplitude and other
  features.
* detect_onset.py: detects onset in data based on amplitude threshold.
* detect_cusum.py: detects abrupt changes in data using cumulative sum algorithm
  (CUSUM).
* detect_seq.py: detects initial and final indices of sequential data identical
  to a parameter.
