Vertex Format Convert (VFC) is a simple library and utility for
converting vertex formats. This is intended to aid in converting from
raw model formats, such as from interchange formats (e.g. OBJ,
COLLADA), into formats that are suitable for usage at runtime. This
may include interleaving vertex data, re-mapping indices (e.g. from
separate indices to a single combined index), and converting to packed
formats.
