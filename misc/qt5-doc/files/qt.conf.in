# This file is installed alongside the qmake symlink in
# ${BUILD_WRKSRC}/qtbase/bin. The qmake binary reads it and overrides some of
# qmake's built-in properties.
#
# qmake's variant properties are not officially documented, so here is
# a quick explanation:
# - $$[FOO] refers to the final locations where things are installed. It can be
#   changed in the Paths section of this file.
# - $$[FOO]/get refers to locations within a build directory, before the files
#   are installed into their final location. It can be changed in the
#   EffectivePaths section.
# - $$[FOO]/src refers to the source locations of some items (e.g. during a
#   build, some files are expected to be in the source directory, not the build
#   directory). It can be configured via the EffectiveSourcePaths entry.
#
# In short, we are tricking qmake into behaving as if we had run `configure
# -developer-build`: all the QT_* and QT_*/get properties point to
# ${BUILD_WRKSRC}/qtbase and its subdirectories so that this is treated like a
# developer build (where the installation prefix is the same as the build
# directory).
#
# Additionally, we point QT_INSTALL_DOC/src to the location where the .qdocconf
# files are installed by the devel/qt5-qdoc-data port.
