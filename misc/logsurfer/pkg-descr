Logsurfer is a program for monitoring system logs in real-time,
and reporting on the occurrence of events. It is similar to the
well-known swatch program on which it is based, but offers a
number of advanced features which swatch does not support.

Logsurfer is capable of grouping related log entries
together - for instance, when a system boots it usually creates
a high number of log messages. In this case, logsurfer can be
setup to group boot-time messages together and forward them in
a single Email message to the system administrator under the
subject line "Host xxx has just booted".
Swatch just couldn't do this properly.
