This is a port of xless (version 1.7), a handy text file viewer for X.
Useful as a viewer tool for other apps (e.g., xfm, the X file manager),
or as a standalone viewer.  Presents a scrollable text window (both
vertical and horizontal scrolling), with a number of clickable buttons.

From the README file:

FEATURES:
   Display either the file(s) specified on the command line or input from
      standard input, supplied by a pipe.  File/pipe may be optionally
      monitored so that the display is continuously updated as new text is
      added.
   Display new files in the current window or by creating a new window.
   Reload or print the displayed file.
   Search the displayed file using either exact, case-insensitive, or
      regular expression patterns.
   Edit the displayed file with your favorite editor (as specified in
      the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variable)
