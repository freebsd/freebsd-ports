json-tui is a JSON terminal UI made in C++.

Features:
* Interactive: Use keyboard or mouse to scroll/expand objects.
* Colors
* Responsive: Adapt to the terminal dimensions. Very long text values are
  wrapped on several lines.
* Cross-platform
* The output is displayed inline with the previous commands. Meaning you can
  still see the json after leaving json-tui.
* (Vim users): Also support j/k for navigation.
* Table view: Turn arrays of objects into tables.
