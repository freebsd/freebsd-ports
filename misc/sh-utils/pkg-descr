The Free Software Foundation's "sh" utilities, including "basename",
"chroot", "date", "dirname", "echo", "env", "expr", "false",
"groups", "hostid", "hostname", "id", "logname", "nice", "nohup",
"pathchk", "pinky", "printenv", "printf", "pwd", "sleep", "stty",
"su", "tee", "test", "true", "tty", "uname", "users", "who",
"whoami", and "yes".

Similar utilities to most of these exist in the FreeBSD base system,
but many of the GNU versions have added functionality that is
useful.

Note that this port will install these utilities with a `g' prefix,
for example gdate, gexpr, or gtest, but the texinfo documentation
will refer to them without the `g' prefix.

GNU su does not support a wheel group.  This port installs it
without the suid bit, unless you define WITH_SUID while building.
