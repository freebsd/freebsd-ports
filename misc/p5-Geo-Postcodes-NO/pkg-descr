Tired of entering the postal location all the time? This is not
necessary, as it is uniquely defined from the postcode. Request the
postcode only, and use this library to get the postal name.

The library can also tell you in which borough by name or number and
county by name the postcode is located. The borough number can be
handy, as it is used when reporting wages and tax to the Norwegian Tax
Administration.
