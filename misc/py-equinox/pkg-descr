JAX library for neural networks and PyTree manipulations.

Equinox is a JAX library that provides everything you need that isn't already
in core JAX:
- neural networks (or more generally any model), with easy-to-use
  PyTorch-like syntax;
- filtered APIs for transformations;
- useful PyTree manipulation routines;
- advanced features like runtime errors;

Equinox isn't a framework: everything you write in Equinox is compatible with
anything else in JAX or the ecosystem.
