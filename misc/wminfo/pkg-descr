This dockapp is designed to be very general purpose. It can display 
any kind of information as long as it is in text-format. It uses 
plugins to retrieve the information. Any script or program that 
sends its output to stdout can be used (have a look at the scripts 
in the plugins directory of the source tarball for examples).
