Business::ISIN is a class which validates ISINs
(International Securities Identification Numbers), the
codes which identify shares in much the same way as ISBNs
identify books.  An ISIN consists of two letters,
identifying the country of origin of the security
according to ISO 3166, followed by nine characters in
[A-Z0-9], followed by a decimal check digit.
