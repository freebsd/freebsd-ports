Gollama is a tool for managing Ollama models.

It provides a TUI (Text User Interface) for listing, inspecting, deleting,
copying, and pushing Ollama models as well as optionally linking them to
LM Studio.

The application allows users to interactively select models, sort, filter, edit,
run, unload and perform actions on them using hotkeys.
