Valentina is an open source pattern drafting software tool, designed to be the
foundation of a new stack of open source tools to remake the garment industry.

Small-batch and custom-sized clothing manufacturing is essential to create a
sustainable future, preserve small- to medium-sized textile spinning and weaving
manufacturers, enable independent and small designers and manufacturers to scale
up to make a decent living, rebuild local garment districts, and reduce or
eliminate slave labor.
