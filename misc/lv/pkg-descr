lv is a powerful multilingual file viewer.  lv can decode and encode
multilingual streams through many coding systems, for example, ISO
2022 based coding systems such as iso-2022-jp, and Unicode streams
encoded in UTF-7 or UTF-8. lv can be used not only as a file viewer
but also as a coding-system translation filter.

lv can recognize multi-bytes patterns as regular expressions, and lv
also provides multilingual grep (1) functionality by giving it another
name, lgrep.
