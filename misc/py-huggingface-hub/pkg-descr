The huggingface_hub library allows you to interact with the Hugging
Face Hub, a platform democratizing open-source Machine Learning for
creators and collaborators. Discover pre-trained models and datasets
for your projects or play with the thousands of machine learning apps
hosted on the Hub. You can also create and share your own models,
datasets and demos with the community. The huggingface_hub library
provides a simple way to do all these things with Python.
