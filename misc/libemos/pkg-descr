The Interpolation library (EMOSLIB) includes Interpolation software and
BUFR &CREX encoding/decoding routines. It is used by the ECMWF meteorological
archival and retrieval system (MARS) and also by the ECMWF workstation Metview.

This software covers :
* Interpolating fields
  * spectral coefficients to spectral coefficients
  * spectral coefficients to rotated spectral coefficients
  * spectral coefficients to regular latitude-longitude grids
  * spectral coefficients to regular gaussian grids
* encoding/decoding of WMO FM-94 BUFR BUFR code messages
* encoding/decoding of WMO FM-95 CREX CREX code messages
* handling pure binary unix files
* multiple (Temperton's) FFT routine
