pdd (Python3 Date Diff) is a tiny command line utility to calculate date
and time difference. It can also be used as a timer. If no program
arguments are specified it shows the current date, time and timezone.

pdd has been written with only one goal - simplicity. Users shouldn't have
to memorize anything.
