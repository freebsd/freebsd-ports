Acme::ButFirst allows you to execute a block of code, but first do
something else. Perfect for when you wish to add to the start of a long
block of code, but don't have the energy to scroll upwards in your editor.

Acme::ButFirst recognises both butfirst and but first as keywords.

Usage of Acme::ButFirst is lexically scoped. ButFirstification can be
explicitly disabled by using no Acme::ButFirst.
