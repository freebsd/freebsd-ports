The open motion planning library (OMPL) is a new library for sampling-based
motion planning, which contains implementations of many state-of-the-art
planning algorithms. The library is designed in a way that it allows the user
to easily solve a variety of complex motion planning problems with minimal
input. OMPL facilitates the addition of new motion planning algorithms, and it
can be conveniently interfaced with other software components. A simple
graphical user interface (GUI) built on top of the library, a number of
tutorials, demos, and programming assignments are designed to teach students
about sampling-based motion planning. The library is also available for use
through Robot Operating System (ROS).
