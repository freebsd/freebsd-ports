Pantry is a command-line oriented nutrient analysis program. It is a
true command-line program: there are no menus, there are no prompts.
Instead, you simply type commands from your shell prompt, and Pantry
does what you ask it to do, displaying results if you have asked it to
do that.

In addition to using Pantry from your shell prompt, you also interact
with it through XML files. Using XML, you can edit Pantry's
configuration file. You can also add nutrient information for custom
foods (though Pantry includes nutrient information for over 7,000 foods
to get you started) and recipes using XML.
