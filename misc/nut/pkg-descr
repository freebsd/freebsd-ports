nut is nutrition software to record what you eat and analyze
your meals for nutrient composition. The database included is
the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 15,
which contains 6,220 foods and 117 nutrients. This database
contains values for vitamins, minerals, fats, calories,
protein, carbohydrates, fiber, etc., and includes the essential
polyunsaturated fats, Omega-3 and Omega-6. Nutrient levels are
expressed as a percentage of the Daily Value, the familiar
standard of food labeling in the United States, but also can be
fully customized. Recipes can be added, and graphs drawn. The
program is completely menu-driven and there are no commands to
learn.
