This code provides a function, `i18n-man', with which you can browse
UNIX manual pages.  Formatting is done in background so that you
can continue to use your Emacs while processing is going on.
The mode also supports hypertext-like following of manual page SEE
ALSO references, and other features.  See below or do `?' in a
manual page buffer for details.

For working with Japanese, English and German, put your dot.emacs file
following:

(autoload 'jman "i18n-man-ja" nil t)
(autoload 'eman "i18n-man-en" nil t)
(autoload 'dman "i18n-man-de" nil t)

then

  M-x jman
    to get a Japanese manual page thru jman(1) and put it in a buffer.
  M-x eman
    to get a English manual page thru man(1) and put it in a buffer.
  M-x dman
    to get a German manual page thru man(1) and put it in a buffer.

If you want byte-compile with your favorite "Emacs", use "byte-comile"
script as:

  # cd /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp
  # /usr/local/share/doc/prom-mew/byte-compile xemacs-mule i18n-man-ja i18n-man-ja.el i18n-man.el

For usage of byte_compile scripts, run byte_compile with -h option.
