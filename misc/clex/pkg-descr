CLEX is a file manager with a full-screen user interface
written in C with the curses library. It displays directory
contents (including file status details) and provides
features like command history, filename insertion, or name
completion in order to help the user to construct commands
to be executed by the shell (there are no built-in commands).
CLEX is easily configurable and all its features are
explained in the on-line help.
