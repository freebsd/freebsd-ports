The Units library provides a means of working with units of measurement at
runtime, including conversion to and from strings. It provides a small number
of types for working with units and measurements and operations necessary for
user input and output with units.

This software was developed for use in LLNL/GridDyn, and HELICS and is currently
a work in progress (though getting close). Namespaces, function names, and code
organization is subject to change though is fairly stable at this point, input
is welcome.
