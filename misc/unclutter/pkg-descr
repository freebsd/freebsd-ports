       unclutter removes the cursor image from the screen so that
       it does not obstruct the area you are looking at after  it
       has  not  moved  for a given time.  It does not do this if
       the cursor is in the root window or a button is down.   It
       tries  to  ignore jitter (small movements due to noise) if
       you have a mouse that twitches.
