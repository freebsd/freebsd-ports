Xgas, animated simulation of an ideal gas

Xgas is a physical simulation of an ideal gas in a heated box.  Gas molecules
move around the box with velocities dependent on their temperature.  A chamber
consisting of two boxes contains the gas molecules collide with the walls, their
temperature approaches that of the box.

Use mouse button 1 to create molecules one at a time at the cursor position.
Use mouse button 2 to create the maximum number of molecules at the cursor
position.
