pyKML is a Python package for creating, parsing, manipulating, and validating
KML, a language for encoding and annotating geographic data.

pyKML is based on the lxml.objectify API which provides a Pythonic API for
working with XML documents. pyKML adds additional functionality specific to the
KML language.

KML comes in several flavors. pyKML can be used with KML documents that follow
the base OGC KML specification, the Google Extensions Namespace, or a
user-supplied extension to the base KML specification (defined by an XML Schema
document).
