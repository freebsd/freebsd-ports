Tool, language, and decoders for inspecting binary data.

In most cases fq works the same way as jq but instead of reading JSON it
reads binary data.  The result is a JSON-compatible structures where each
value has a bit range, symbolic interpretations, and knows how to present
itself in a useful way.
