This is a tool for eDonkey2000 that re-creates x.part.met files
that have been lost or set zero size after a crash.

Obviously, this only works if the x.part file in your temp folder
survives. Only those 9MB blocks will be saved which have been fully
downloaded, but you'll be able to continue your download.

The tool tries to find the best match from information stored in
the known.met file and all the x.part.met files in the temp folder.

Therefore, you can increase the chance of recovery by searching for
the file you are trying to restore and put as many possible candidates
as you can find in the download list (which you can cancel again
after using this tool).

N.B. Obviously these candidates should have the same size as your
download was/is supposed to have! Therefore, if your download was
supposed to be 699MB when finished, files with 720MB or 750MB are
NOT likely candidates, even if the name is the same.
