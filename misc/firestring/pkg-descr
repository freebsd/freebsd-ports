libfirestring is a string handling library that provides
maximum length aware string handling functions to programs.
Several functions provide saner interfaces than the standard
libc functions.  libfirestring also provides functions that
are in most libc's but not provided for by ANSI C, enabling
programmers to write ANSI C-compliant code while using such
safe functions (strcasecmp, strncasecmp, snprintf).

libfirestring provides a set of functions for dealing with
EStrings.  EStrings are binary-safe objects that, when used
with the firestring functions, are overflow safe, because
they include allocated memory size information with them.

libfirestring also includes functions for dealing with
reading configuration files in an easy to program fashion.
