Geo::Coder::Multiple is a wrapper for multiple Geo::Coder::* modules.

Most free geocoding datasource specify a limit to the number of queries which
can be sent from an IP or made using an API key in a 24 hour period. This
module balances the incoming requests across the available sources to ensure
individual limits are exceeded only when the total limit is exceeded.

The algorithm for load balancing takes into account the limit imposed by the
source per 24 hour period.
