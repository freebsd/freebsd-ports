Book of Psalms from the Douai Bible (1610) in fortune(6) file format

In general, taking random out-of-context verses from a Bible is a
VERY bad idea. This said, this is an experiment to generate a not
too bad fortune-cookie database under the following principles:

- Only the text from the psalms, which are usually meant for praying,
  were taken.
- The texts always include at least some context: you are always
  notified where the text came from and there is always sufficient
  text so that the phrases make sense.
- The text was taken from the classic Douai Bible, a direct translation
  from the latin Vulgata. The old language will not give you false
  impressions that you are actually understanding it fully.
- No effort was done to remove the original comments. Non-Christians
  may rightfully feel the translation is biased.

This is meant to be a general aid for Christian meditation: it is not
generally to be taken as my message-of-the-day from God.

To use, you need UNIX fortune(6) utility and you should follow the
instructions from the corresponding man page.
