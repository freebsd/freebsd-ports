The boxes command is a text filter which can draw ASCII art boxes around
its input text.  These boxes may also be removed, even if they have
been badly damaged by editing of the text inside.  Since boxes may be
open on any side, boxes can also be used to create regional comments in
any programming language.  With the help of an editor macro or mapping,
damaged boxes can easily be repaired.
