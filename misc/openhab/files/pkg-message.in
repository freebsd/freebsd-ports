  message: <<EOM
The openhab user interface writes to /var/db/openhab
(config) and to %%ETCDIR%% (when installing add-onds).
The config in %%ETCDIR%% is evaluated additionally to
/var/db/openhab.

See %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/openhab for environment variables you need
to set by hand (all "export"-ones) if you want to execute some of
the openhab commands from the shell directly.

When the openhab docs talk about "userdata", look into /var/db/openhab.

Serial ports do not work with FreeBSD, see:
	https://github.com/openhab/openhab1-addons/wiki/FreeBSD

By default openhab tries to use IPv6. As FreeBSD does not support
mapping IPV4 multicast addresses inside IPv6 addresses you will get
the following error message:
	[ERROR] [org.jupnp.transport.Router] - Unable to initialize network router: org.jupnp.transport.spi.InitializationException: Could not initialize MulticastReceiverImpl: java.net.SocketException: Invalid argument

A workaround is to use the following rc.conf setting which will
prefer IPv4 over IPv6:
	openhab_java_opts="-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"

OpenHAB contains some files/directories ending in .core, if you have
	daily_clean_disks_enable="YES"
for periodic runs (this is the default setting in /etc/default/periodic.conf), you should
remove "*.core" from the daily_clean_disks_files setting in periodic.conf. Example:
	daily_clean_disks_files="[#,]* .#* a.out *.CKP .emacs_[0-9]*"


If you upgrade from a pevious version, make a backup of
	/var/db/openhab
and read about the breaking changes in the release notes at
	https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/

You may have to update the files in
	/var/db/openhab/userdata/etc/
from
	%%DATADIR%%/etc/
by hand.

At the end you need to run
	export JAVA_VERSION=17
	export OPENHAB_USERDATA=/var/db/openhab/userdata
	java -jar "%%LOCALBASE%%/libexec/openhab/runtime/bin/upgradetool.jar"

In case you see issues in the logfile or outdated info in the webinterface,
you may want to remove the cache and restart:
	rm -r /var/db/openhab/userdata/cache/org.eclipse.osgi
