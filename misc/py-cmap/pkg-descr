cmap is a work-in-progress colormap library for python, providing all of the
colormaps in matplotlib, vispy, cmocean, (and more), with no dependencies
beyond numpy.

Mapping scalar values to colors is a very common procedure in scientific
visualization; as such, many visualization libraries (e.g. matplotlib, vispy,
napari, etc...) have some need for and some internal representation of colors
and colormaps.
