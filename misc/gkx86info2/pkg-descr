[ excerpt from developer's www site ]

This is a plugin for gkrellm that simply prints the current clock
speed for users that own speed stepping processors.

It works on normal non-stepping processors also, but there is not any
point in mesuring the clock if it is the same every time you mesure
it, now is there?

Included code from x86info to calculate an estimate clock speed.
