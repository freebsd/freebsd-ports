[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

Metalink is the main Metalink generation tool. It combines a list
of mirrors (from stdin) and a number of files into one Metalink
record (stdout). It can also be used to transform a MD5SUMS file
into a metalink.

Features currently include:

- Hashing algorithms: md4 md5 sha1 sha256 sha384 sha512 rmd160 tiger
  crc32 ed2k gnunet
- Generation of Metalink files from MD5SUMS lists
