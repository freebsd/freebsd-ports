MMEngine is a foundational library for training deep learning models based on
PyTorch. It provides a solid engineering foundation and frees developers from
writing redundant codes on workflows. It serves as the training engine of all
OpenMMLab codebases, which support hundreds of algorithms in various research
areas. Moreover, MMEngine is also generic to be applied to non-OpenMMLab
projects.
