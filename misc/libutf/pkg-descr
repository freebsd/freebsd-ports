This software is a library which implements UTF-8 support routines,
and uses those routines and others to implement UTF-8aware regular
expresions.  Language collation sequences are specified in a text
file, ${PREFIX}/share/examples/libutf/langcoll.utf, and feedback
as to their correctness is appreciated.
