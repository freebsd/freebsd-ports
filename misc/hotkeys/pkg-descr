This program sits at the back and listens for the "special" hotkeys that
you won't normally use on your internet/Multimedia keyboards.
The buttons perform their intended behaviors, such as volume up and down,
mute the speaker, launch applications, etc.

NOTE: CDROM & APM features have been disabled
