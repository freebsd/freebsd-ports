 At this current stage CDROM & APM support has been disabled.
 I will need to remap the linux CDROM cdrom.h code to work with

=======================================================================

Rename ${PREFIX}/etc/hotkeys.conf.default to ${PREFIX}/etc/hotkeys.conf
and edit to setup your keyboard settings

 -- OR --

Copy to ~/.hotkeys/hotkeys.conf and edit config there
