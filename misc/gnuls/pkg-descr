`gnuls' is a port of the GNU colorized `ls' program--the one most Linux
users are familiar with.

The port installs four programs in `/usr/local/bin': `gnuls', `dir', `vdir'
and `dircolors'. It also installs man pages for all four programs. See the
individual man pages for details on each program.

NOTES:

1. This port modifies the GNU `coreutils' make procedure so that it
   installs only programs and man pages listed above. In particular, it
   does not install the various GNU info files associated with the
   programs.

2. This port installs GNU's `ls' as `gnuls' so it won't conflict with the
   normal BSD `ls' program or the BSD `colorls' program (the latter
   available from the ports collection).

3. This colorized `ls' program is not the same as the `colorls' program
   available from the ports collection.
