This implementation of the Unix write program adds many nice features
while remaining close to the standard Unix program in spirit. It has been
heavily used on M-Net since 1985 and on Grex since 1991, as well as a few
other systems. It is a ground-up reimplementation using no proprietary
code. It's available under a Berkeley-style license (no charge, no
restriction on commercial use, just don't take my name off of it). The
current version is fairly portable. 

Orville write was written for use on M-Net and Grex, both public access
unix systems in Ann Arbor. As such, many of the features are designed to
support a system featuring a delicate mix of novice users and hostile
pranksters, plus a lot of people who just want to talk. It's user
interface is pretty much identical to the normal write program, but it
offers many extensions and improvements.
