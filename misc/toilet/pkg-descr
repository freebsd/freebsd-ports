The TOIlet project attempts to create a free replacement for the FIGlet
utility. TOIlet stands for "The Other Implementation's letters", coined
after FIGlet's "Frank, Ian and Glen's letters".

TOIlet is in its very early development phase. It uses the powerful
libcaca library to achieve various text-based effects. TOIlet
implements or plans to implement the following features:
* The ability to load FIGlet fonts
* Support for Unicode input and output
* Support for colour fonts
* Support for colour output
* Support for various output formats: HTML, IRC, ANSI...

TOIlet also aims for full FIGlet compatibility. It is currently able to
load FIGlet fonts and perform horizontal smushing.
