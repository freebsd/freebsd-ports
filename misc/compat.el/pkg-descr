Compat.el is a forwards-compatibility library for (GNU) Emacs Lisp,
versions 24.3 and newer.

The intended audience of this library aren't day-to-day users, but
package developers that wish to make use of newer functionality, not
provided in older versions of Emacs, without breaking compatibility
for users bound to specific Emacs releases.

Version 24.3 is chosen as the oldest version, because this is the
newest version on CentOS 7. It is intended to preserve compatibility
for at least as the Centos 7 reaches EOL, 2024.

Note that compat.el provides a few prefixed function, ie. functions
with a compat- prefix. These are used to provide extended
functionality for commands that are already defined (sort, assoc,
...). It might be possible to transform these into advised functions
later on, so that the modified functionality is accessible without a
prefix. Feedback on this point is appreciated.
