Kartograph is a simple and lightweight framework for building interactive map
applications without Google Maps or any other mapping service. It was created
with the needs of designers and data journalists in mind.

Kartograph is two libraries. One generates beautiful & compact SVGmaps, the
other helps you to create interactive maps that run across all major browsers.
