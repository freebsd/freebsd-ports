Deark is a portable command-line utility that can decode certain types of files,
and either convert them to a more-modern or more-readable format, or extract
embedded files from them. It also has an option (-d) to display detailed
information about a file’s contents and metadata. It’s Free Software.

The files it writes are usually named "output.*".

When processing "archive" formats that contain other files, it's usually best to
use Deark only to convert to ZIP format, so that the filenames and paths can be
retained. Suggest options "-zip -ka".
