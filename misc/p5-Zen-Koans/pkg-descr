A koan (pronounced /ko.an/) is a story, dialog, question, or statement in 
the history and lore of Chan (Zen) Buddhism, generally containing aspects 
that are inaccessible to rational understanding, yet that may be 
accessible to intuition.

This module contains over 100 Zen Koans, all taken from Ashidakim Zen 
Koans here: http://www.ashidakim.com/zenkoans/zenindex.html
