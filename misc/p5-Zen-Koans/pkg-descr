A koan (pronounced /ko.an/) is a story, dialog, question, or statement in
the history and lore of Chan (Zen) Buddhism, generally containing aspects
that are inaccessible to rational understanding, yet that may be
accessible to intuition.

This module contains over 100 Zen Koans, all taken from Ashidakim Zen
