Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework,
particularly designed for machine learning. It features an imperative,
define-by-run style user API. Thanks to our define-by-run API, the code written
with Optuna enjoys high modularity, and the user of Optuna can dynamically
construct the search spaces for the hyperparameters.
