Qiskit [quiss-kit] is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers
at the level of pulses, circuits, and application modules.

Qiskit Machine Learning is one of Qiskit components. It introduces fundamental
computational building blocks - such as Quantum Kernels and Quantum Neural
Networks - used in different applications, including classification and
regression. On the one hand, this design is very easy to use and allows users to
rapidly prototype a first model without deep quantum computing knowledge. On the
other hand, Qiskit Machine Learning is very flexible, and users can easily
extend it to support cutting-edge quantum machine learning research.
