Ipyfastscape is interactive widgets for topographic data analysis and modelling
in Jupyter notebooks.

While ipyfastscape is tightly integrated with fastscape, it also integrates very
well with any data in the form of an xarray dataset or any model created with
xarray-simlab.

The widgets available here are built on top of libraries of the jupyter's widget
ecosystem such as ipywidgets and ipygany. You can reuse those high-level UI
components as-is within notebooks (embedded mini-apps) or for building
interactive dashboards that you can then publish as standalone web applications.
