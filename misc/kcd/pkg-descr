kcd allows user to change directory by using various methods:

	- By using cursor keys to navigate through the directory tree
	  screen
	- By searching in directory tree screen
	- By typing part of the directory name directly at the
	  command line.

	Other features include:
	- Can be configured to filter out to some subdirectories,
	  useful for cdrom and msdos partition mounting points
	- Can be configured to scan directory tree starting from some
	  specified directory inwards, for example, home directory.
	- If the number directories that matches to the name given in
	  the command line exceeds a specified number,  kcd displays
	  the whole list.
	- Faster directory rescan if old data file exists.  Only
	  directories with newer modified/changed time are scanned.
	- Sorted directory tree listing.
