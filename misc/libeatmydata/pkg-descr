libeatmydata is a small LD_PRELOAD library designed to (transparently) disable
fsync (and friends, like open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making
software that writes data safely to disk a lot quicker and making this
software no longer crash safe.

DO NOT use libeatmydata on software where you care about what it
stores. It's called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.
