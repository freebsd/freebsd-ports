Rewrite of getopt(1) with the following features:

* It can do anything that the GNU getopt(3) routines can do.
* It can cope with spaces and shell metacharacters within arguments.
* It can parse long parameters.
* It can shuffle parameters, so you can mix options and other parameters
  on the command-line.
* It can be easily identified as an enhanced getopt(1) from within shell
  scripts.
* It can report parse errors as coming from the shell script.
* It compiles cleanly with both libc-5 and glibc-2.
