LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and
deploying long-running, stateful agents.

Core benefits of LangGraph include:
- Durable execution: Build agents that persist through failures and can run
  for extended periods, automatically resuming from exactly where they left off.
- Human-in-the-loop: Seamlessly incorporate human oversight by inspecting and
  modifying agent state at any point during execution.
- Comprehensive memory: Create truly stateful agents with both short-term
  working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term persistent memory
  across sessions.
- Debugging with LangSmith: Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior
  with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state
  transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
- Production-ready deployment: Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently
  with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of
  stateful, long-running workflows.
