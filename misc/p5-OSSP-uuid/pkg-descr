OSSP::uuid is the Perl API to the ossp-uuid library which is used to
generate DCE 1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant Universally Unique
Identifiers (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1
(time and node based), version 3 (name based, MD5), version 4
(random number based) and version 5 (name based, SHA-1).
