.SH NAME
trurl \- transpose URLs
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]trurl [options / URLs]\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]trurl\f[R] parses, manipulates and outputs URLs and parts of URLs.
.PP
It uses the RFC 3986 definition of URLs and it uses libcurl\[cq]s URL
parser to do so, which includes a few \[lq]extensions\[rq].
The URL support is limited to \[lq]hierarchical\[rq] URLs, the ones that
use \f[CR]://\f[R] separators after the scheme.
.PP
Typically you pass in one or more URLs and decide what of that you want
output.
Possibly modifying the URL as well.
.PP
trurl knows URLs and every URL consists of up to ten separate and
independent \f[I]components\f[R].
These components can be extracted, removed and updated with trurl and
they are referred to by their respective names: scheme, user, password,
options, host, port, path, query, fragment and zoneid.
.SH NORMALIZATION
When provided a URL to work with, trurl \[lq]normalizes\[rq] it.
It means that individual URL components are URL decoded then URL encoded
back again and set in the URL.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[aq]http://ex%61mple:80/%62ath/a/../b?%2e%FF#tes%74\[aq]
http://example/bath/b?.%ff#test
.EE
.SH OPTIONS
Options start with one or two dashes.
Many of the options require an additional value next to them.
.PP
Any other argument is interpreted as a URL argument, and is treated as
if it was following a \f[CR]\-\-url\f[R] option.
.PP
The first argument that is exactly two dashes (\f[CR]\-\-\f[R]), marks
the end of options; any argument after the end of options is interpreted
as a URL argument even if it starts with a dash.
.PP
Long options can be provided either as \f[CR]\-\-flag argument\f[R] or
as \f[CR]\-\-flag=argument\f[R].
.SS \-a, \[en]append [component]=[data]
Append data to a component.
This can only append data to the path and the query components.
.PP
For path, this URL encodes and appends the new segment to the path,
separated with a slash.
.PP
For query, this URL encodes and appends the new segment to the query,
separated with an ampersand (&).
If the appended segment contains an equal sign (\f[CR]=\f[R]) that one
is kept verbatim and both sides of the first occurrence are URL encoded
separately.
.SS \[en]accept\-space
When set, trurl tries to accept spaces as part of the URL and instead
URL encode such occurrences accordingly.
.PP
According to RFC 3986, a space cannot legally be part of a URL.
This option provides a best\-effort to convert the provided string into
a valid URL.
.SS \[en]as\-idn
Converts a punycode ASCII hostname to its original International Domain
Name in Unicode.
If the hostname is not using punycode then the original hostname is
used.
.SS \[en]curl
Only accept URL schemes supported by libcurl.
.SS \[en]default\-port
When set, trurl uses the scheme\[cq]s default port number for URLs with
a known scheme, and without an explicit port number.
.PP
Note that trurl only knows default port numbers for URL schemes that are
supported by libcurl.
.PP
Since, by default, trurl removes default port numbers from URLs with a
known scheme, this option is pretty much ignored unless one of
\f[I]\[en]get\f[R], \f[I]\[en]json\f[R], and \f[I]\[en]keep\-port\f[R]
is not also specified.
.SS \-f, \[en]url\-file [filename]
Read URLs to work on from the given file.
Use the filename \f[CR]\-\f[R] (a single minus) to tell trurl to read
the URLs from stdin.
.PP
Each line needs to be a single valid URL.
trurl removes one carriage return character at the end of the line if
present, trims off all the trailing space and tab characters, and skips
all empty (after trimming) lines.
.PP
The maximum line length supported in a file like this is 4094 bytes.
Lines that exceed that length are skipped, and a warning is printed to
stderr when they are encountered.
.SS \-g, \[en]get [format]
Output text and URL data according to the provided format string.
Components from the URL can be output when specified as
\f[B]{component}\f[R] or \f[B][component]\f[R], with the name of the
part show within curly braces or brackets.
You can not mix braces and brackets for this purpose in the same command
line.
.PP
The following component names are available (case sensitive): url,
scheme, user, password, options, host, port, path, query, fragment and
zoneid.
.PP
\f[B]{component}\f[R] expands to nothing if the given component does not
have a value.
.PP
Components are shown URL decoded by default.
.PP
URL decoding a component may cause problems to display it.
Such problems make a warning get displayed unless \f[B]\[en]quiet\f[R]
is used.
.PP
trurl supports a range of different qualifiers, or prefixes, to the
component that changes how it handles it:
.PP
If \f[B]url:\f[R] is specified, like \f[CR]{url:path}\f[R], the
component gets output URL encoded.
As a shortcut, \f[CR]url:\f[R] also works written as a single colon:
\f[CR]{:path}\f[R].
.PP
If \f[B]strict:\f[R] is specified, like \f[CR]{strict:path}\f[R], URL
decode problems are turned into errors.
In this stricter mode, a URL decode problem makes trurl stop what it is
doing and return with exit code 10.
.PP
If \f[B]must:\f[R] is specified, like \f[CR]{must:query}\f[R], it makes
trurl return an error if the requested component does not exist in the
URL.
By default a missing component will just be shown blank.
.PP
If \f[B]default:\f[R] is specified, like \f[CR]{default:url}\f[R] or
\f[CR]{default:port}\f[R], and the port is not explicitly specified in
the URL, the scheme\[cq]s default port is output if it is known.
.PP
If \f[B]puny:\f[R] is specified, like \f[CR]{puny:url}\f[R] or
\f[CR]{puny:host}\f[R], the punycoded version of the hostname is used in
the output.
This option is mutually exclusive with \f[B]idn:\f[R].
.PP
If \f[B]idn:\f[R] is specified like \f[CR]{idn:url}\f[R] or
\f[CR]{idn:host}\f[R], the International Domain Name version of the
hostname is used in the output if it is provided as a correctly encoded
punycode version.
This option is mutually exclusive with \f[B]puny:\f[R].
.PP
If \f[I]\[en]default\-port\f[R] is specified, all formats are expanded
as if they used \f[I]default:\f[R]; and if \f[I]\[en]punycode\f[R] is
used, all formats are expanded as if they used \f[I]puny:\f[R].
Also note that \f[CR]{url}\f[R] is affected by the
\f[I]\[en]keep\-port\f[R] option.
.PP
Hosts provided as IPv6 numerical addresses are provided within square
brackets.
Like \f[CR][fe80::20c:29ff:fe9c:409b]\f[R].
.PP
Hosts provided as IPv4 numerical addresses are \f[I]normalized\f[R] and
provided as four dot\-separated decimal numbers when output.
.PP
You can access specific keys in the query string using the format
\f[B]{query:key}\f[R].
Then the value of the first matching key is output using a case
sensitive match.
When extracting a URL decoded query key that contains \f[CR]%00\f[R],
such octet is replaced with a single period \f[CR].\f[R] in the output.
.PP
You can access specific keys in the query string and out all values
using the format \f[B]{query\-all:key}\f[R].
This looks for \f[I]key\f[R] case sensitively and outputs all values for
that key space\-separated.
.PP
The \f[I]format\f[R] string supports the following backslash sequences:
.PP
\[rs] \- backslash
.PP
\[rs]t \- tab
.PP
\[rs]n \- newline
.PP
\[rs]r \- carriage return
.PP
\[rs]{ \- an open curly brace that does not start a variable
.PP
\[rs][ \- an open bracket that does not start a variable
.PP
All other text in the format string is shown as\-is.
.SS \-h, \[en]help
Show the help output.
.SS \[en]iterate [component]=[item1 item2 \&...]
Set the component to multiple values and output the result once for each
iteration.
Several combined iterations are allowed to generate combinations, but
only one \f[I]\[en]iterate\f[R] option per component.
The listed items to iterate over should be separated by single spaces.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl example.com \-\-iterate=scheme=\[dq]ftp https\[dq] \-\-iterate=port=\[dq]22 80\[dq]
ftp://example.com:22/
ftp://example.com:80/
https://example.com:22/
https://example.com:80/
.EE
.SS \[en]json
Outputs all set components of the URLs as JSON objects.
All components of the URL that have data get populated in the parts
object using their component names.
See below for details on the format.
.PP
The URL components are provided URL decoded.
Change that with \f[B]\[en]urlencode\f[R].
.SS \[en]keep\-port
By default, trurl removes default port numbers from URLs with a known
scheme even if they are explicitly specified in the input URL.
This options, makes trurl not remove them.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl https://example.com:443/ \-\-keep\-port
https://example.com:443/
.EE
.SS \[en]no\-guess\-scheme
Disables libcurl\[cq]s scheme guessing feature.
URLs that do not contain a scheme are treated as invalid URLs.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl example.com \-\-no\-guess\-scheme
trurl note: Bad scheme [example.com]
.EE
.SS \[en]punycode
Uses the punycode version of the hostname, which is how International
Domain Names are converted into plain ASCII.
If the hostname is not using IDN, the regular ASCII name is used.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://åäö/ \-\-punycode
http://xn\-\-4cab6c/
.EE
.SS \[en]qtrim [what]
Trims data off a query.
.PP
\f[I]what\f[R] is specified as a full name of a name/value pair, or as a
word prefix (using a single trailing asterisk (\f[CR]*\f[R])) which
makes trurl remove the tuples from the query string that match the
instruction.
.PP
To match a literal trailing asterisk instead of using a wildcard, escape
it with a backslash in front of it.
Like \f[CR]\[rs]\[rs]*\f[R].
.SS \[en]query\-separator [what]
Specify the single letter used for separating query pairs.
The default is \f[CR]&\f[R] but at least in the past sometimes
semicolons \f[CR];\f[R] or even colons \f[CR]:\f[R] have been used for
this purpose.
If your URL uses something other than the default letter, setting the
right one makes sure trurl can do its query operations properly.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[dq]https://curl.se?b=name:a=age\[dq] \-\-sort\-query \-\-query\-separator \[dq]:\[dq]
https://curl.se/?a=age:b=name
.EE
.SS \[en]quiet
Suppress (some) notes and warnings.
.SS \[en]redirect URL
Redirect the URL to this new location.
The redirection is performed on the base URL, so, if no base URL is
specified, no redirection is performed.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \-\-url https://curl.se/we/are.html \-\-redirect ../here.html
https://curl.se/here.html
.EE
.SS \[en]replace [data]
Replaces a URL query.
.PP
data can either take the form of a single value, or as a key/value pair
in the shape \f[I]foo=bar\f[R].
If replace is called on an item that is not in the list of queries trurl
ignores that item.
.PP
trurl URL encodes both sides of the \f[CR]=\f[R] character in the given
input data argument.
.SS \[en]replace\[en]append [data]
Works the same as \f[I]\[en]replace\f[R], but trurl appends a missing
query string if it is not in the query list already.
.SS \-s, \[en]set [component][:]=[data]
Set this URL component.
Setting blank string (\f[CR]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R]) clears the component from
the URL.
.PP
The following components can be set: url, scheme, user, password,
options, host, port, path, query, fragment and zoneid.
.PP
If a simple \f[CR]=\f[R]\-assignment is used, the data is URL encoded
when applied.
If \f[CR]:=\f[R] is used, the data is assumed to already be URL encoded
and stored as\-is.
.PP
If \f[CR]?=\f[R] is used, the set is only performed if the component is
not already set.
It avoids overwriting any already set data.
.PP
You can also combine \f[CR]:\f[R] and \f[CR]?\f[R] into \f[CR]?:=\f[R]
if desired.
.PP
If no URL or \f[I]\[en]url\-file\f[R] argument is provided, trurl tries
to create a URL using the components provided by the \f[I]\[en]set\f[R]
options.
If not enough components are specified, this fails.
.SS \[en]sort\-query
The \[lq]variable=content\[rq] tuplets in the query component are sorted
in a case insensitive alphabetical order.
This helps making URLs identical that otherwise only had their query
pairs in different orders.
.SS \[en]trim [component]=[what]
Deprecated: use \f[B]\[en]qtrim\f[R].
.PP
Trims data off a component.
Currently this can only trim a query component.
.PP
\f[I]what\f[R] is specified as a full word or as a word prefix (using a
single trailing asterisk (\f[CR]*\f[R])) which makes trurl remove the
tuples from the query string that match the instruction.
.PP
To match a literal trailing asterisk instead of using a wildcard, escape
it with a backslash in front of it.
Like \f[CR]\[rs]\[rs]*\f[R].
.SS \[en]url URL
Set the input URL to work with.
The URL may be provided without a scheme, which then typically is not
actually a legal URL but trurl tries to figure out what is meant and
guess what scheme to use (unless \f[I]\[en]no\-guess\-scheme\f[R] is
used).
.PP
Providing multiple URLs makes trurl act on all URLs in a serial fashion.
.PP
If the URL cannot be parsed for whatever reason, trurl simply moves on
to the next provided URL \- unless \f[I]\[en]verify\f[R] is used.
.SS \[en]urlencode
Outputs URL encoded version of components by default when using
\f[I]\[en]get\f[R] or \f[I]\[en]json\f[R].
.SS \-v, \[en]version
Show version information and exit.
.SS \[en]verify
When a URL is provided, return error immediately if it does not parse as
a valid URL.
In normal cases, trurl can forgive a bad URL input.
.SH URL COMPONENTS
.SS scheme
This is the leading character sequence of a URL, excluding the
\[lq]://\[rq] separator.
It cannot be specified URL encoded.
.PP
A URL cannot exist without a scheme, but unless
\f[B]\[en]no\-guess\-scheme\f[R] is used trurl guesses what scheme that
was intended if none was provided.
.PP
Examples:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl https://odd/ \-g \[aq]{scheme}\[aq]
https

$ trurl odd \-g \[aq]{scheme}\[aq]
http

$ trurl odd \-g \[aq]{scheme}\[aq] \-\-no\-guess\-scheme
trurl note: Bad scheme [odd]
.EE
.SS user
After the scheme separator, there can be a username provided.
If it ends with a colon (\f[CR]:\f[R]), there is a password provided.
If it ends with an at character (\f[CR]\[at]\f[R]) there is no password
provided in the URL.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl https://user%3a%40:secret\[at]odd/ \-g \[aq]{user}\[aq]
user:\[at]
.EE
.SS password
If the password ends with a semicolon (\f[CR];\f[R]) there is an options
field following.
This field is only accepted by trurl for URLs using the IMAP scheme.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl https://user:secr%65t\[at]odd/ \-g \[aq]{password}\[aq]
secret
.EE
.SS options
This field can only end with an at character (\f[CR]\[at]\f[R]) that
separates the options from the hostname.
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[aq]imap://user:pwd;giraffe\[at]odd\[aq] \-g \[aq]{options}\[aq]
giraffe
.EE
.PP
If the scheme is not IMAP, the \f[CR]giraffe\f[R] part is instead
considered part of the password:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[aq]sftp://user:pwd;giraffe\[at]odd\[aq] \-g \[aq]{password}\[aq]
pwd;giraffe
.EE
.PP
We strongly advice users to %\-encode \f[CR];\f[R], \f[CR]:\f[R] and
\f[CR]\[at]\f[R] in URLs of course to reduce the risk for confusions.
.SS host
The host component is the hostname or a numerical IP address.
If a hostname is provided, it can be an International Domain Name
non\-ASCII characters.
A hostname can be provided URL encoded.
.PP
trurl provides options for working with the IDN hostnames either as IDN
or in its punycode version.
.PP
Example, convert an IDN name to punycode in the output:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://åäö/ \-\-punycode
http://xn\-\-4cab6c/
.EE
.PP
Or the reverse, convert a punycode hostname into its IDN version:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://xn\-\-4cab6c/ \-\-as\-idn
http://åäö/
.EE
.PP
If the URL\[cq]s hostname starts with an open bracket (\f[CR][\f[R]) it
is a numerical IPv6 address that also must end with a closing bracket
(\f[CR]]\f[R]).
trurl normalizes IPv6 addreses.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[aq]http://[2001:9b1:0:0:0:0:7b97:364b]/\[aq]
http://[2001:9b1::7b97:364b]/
.EE
.PP
A numerical IPV4 address can be specified using one, two, three or four
numbers separated with dots and they can use decimal, octal or
hexadecimal.
trurl normalizes provided addresses and uses four dotted decimal numbers
in its output.
.PP
Examples:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://646464646/
http://38.136.68.134/

$ trurl http://246.646/
http://246.0.2.134/

$ trurl http://246.46.646/
http://246.46.2.134/

$ trurl http://0x14.0xb3022/
http://20.11.48.34/
.EE
.SS zoneid
If the provided host is an IPv6 address, it might contain a specific
zoneid.
A number or a network interface name normally.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[aq]http://[2001:9b1::f358:1ba4:7b97:364b%enp3s0]/\[aq] \-g \[aq]{zoneid}\[aq]
enp3s0
.EE
.SS port
If the host ends with a colon (\f[CR]:\f[R]) then a port number follows.
It is a 16 bit decimal number that may not be URL encoded.
.PP
trurl knows the default port number for many URL schemes so it can show
port numbers for a URL even if none was explicitly used in the URL.
With \f[B]\[en]default\-port\f[R] it can add the default port to a URL
even when not provide.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http:/a \-\-default\-port
http://a:80/
.EE
.PP
Similarly, trurl normally hides the port number if the given number is
the default.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http:/a:80
http://a/
.EE
.PP
But a user can make trurl keep the port even if it is the default, with
\f[B]\[en]keep\-port\f[R].
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http:/a:80 \-\-keep\-port
http://a:80/
.EE
.SS path
A URL path is assumed to always start with and contain at least a slash
(\f[CR]/\f[R]), even if none is actually provided in the URL.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://xn\-\-4cab6c \-g \[aq][path]\[aq]
/
.EE
.PP
When setting the path, trurl will inject a leading slash if none is
provided:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://hello \-s path=\[dq]pony\[dq]
http://hello/pony

$ trurl http://hello \-s path=\[dq]/pony\[dq]
http://hello/pony
.EE
.PP
If the input path contains dotdot or dot\-slash sequences, they are
normalized away.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://hej/one/../two/../three/./four
http://hej/three/four
.EE
.PP
You can append a new segment to an existing path with
\f[B]\[en]append\f[R] like this:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://twelve/three?hello \-\-append path=four
http://twelve/three/four?hello
.EE
.SS query
The query part does not include the leading question mark (\f[CR]?\f[R])
separator when extracted with trurl.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://horse?elephant \-g \[aq]{query}\[aq]
elephant
.EE
.PP
Example, if you set the query with a leading question mark:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://horse?elephant \-s \[dq]query=?elephant\[dq]
http://horse/?%3felephant
.EE
.PP
Query parts are often made up of a series of name=value pairs separated
with ampersands (\f[CR]&\f[R]), and trurl offers several ways to work
with such.
.PP
Append a new name value pair to a URL with \f[B]\[en]append\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://host?name=hello \-\-append query=search=life
http://host/?name=hello&search=life
.EE
.PP
You cam \f[B]\[en]replace\f[R] the value of a specific existing name
among the pairs:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[aq]http://alpha?one=real&two=fake\[aq] \-\-replace two=alsoreal
http://alpha/?one=real&two=alsoreal
.EE
.PP
If the specific name you want to replace perhaps does not exist in the
URL, you can opt to replace \f[I]or\f[R] append the pair:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[aq]http://alpha?one=real&two=fake\[aq] \-\-replace\-append three=alsoreal
http://alpha/?one=real&two=fake&three=alsoreal
.EE
.PP
In order to perhaps compare two URLs using query name value pairs,
sorting them first at least increases the chances of it working:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[dq]http://alpha/?one=real&two=fake&three=alsoreal\[dq] \-\-sort\-query
http://alpha/?one=real&three=alsoreal&two=fake
.EE
.PP
Remove name/value pairs from the URL by specifying exact name or
wildcard pattern with \f[B]\[en]qtrim\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[aq]https://example.com?a12=hej&a23=moo&b12=foo\[aq] \-\-qtrim a*\[aq]
https://example.com/?b12=foo
.EE
.SS fragment
The fragment part does not include the leading hash sign (\f[CR]#\f[R])
separator when extracted with trurl.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl http://horse#elephant \-g \[aq]{fragment}\[aq]
elephant
.EE
.PP
Example, if you set the fragment with a leading hash sign:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl \[dq]http://horse#elephant\[dq] \-s \[dq]fragment=#zebra\[dq]
http://horse/#%23zebra
.EE
.PP
The fragment part of a URL is for local purposes only.
The data in there is never actually sent over the network when a URL is
used for transfers.
.SS url
trurl supports \f[B]url\f[R] as a named component for \f[B]\[en]get\f[R]
to allow for more powerful outputs, but of course it is not actually a
\[lq]component\[rq]; it is the full URL.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.EX
$ trurl ftps://example.com:2021/p%61th \-g \[aq]{url}\[aq]
ftps://example.com:2021/path
.EE
.SH JSON output format
The \f[I]\[en]json\f[R] option outputs a JSON array with one or more
objects.
One for each URL.
Each URL JSON object contains a number of properties, a series of
key/value pairs.
The exact set present depends on the given URL.
.SS url
This key exists in every object.
It is the complete URL.
Affected by \f[I]\[en]default\-port\f[R], \f[I]\[en]keep\-port\f[R], and
\f[I]\[en]punycode\f[R].
.SS parts
This key exists in every object, and contains an object with a key for
each of the settable URL components.
If a component is missing, it means it is not present in the URL.
The parts are URL decoded unless \f[I]\[en]urlencode\f[R] is used.
.SS parts.scheme
The URL scheme.
.SS parts.user
The username.
.SS parts.password
The password.
.SS parts.options
The options.
Note that only a few URL schemes support the \[lq]options\[rq]
component.
.SS parts.host
The normalized hostname.
It might be a UTF\-8 name if an IDN name was used.
It can also be a normalized IPv4 or IPv6 address.
An IPv6 address always starts with a bracket (\f[B][\f[R]) \- and no
other hostnames can contain such a symbol.
If \f[I]\[en]punycode\f[R] is used, the punycode version of the host is
outputted instead.
.SS parts.port
The provided port number as a string.
If the port number was not provided in the URL, but the scheme is a
known one, and \f[I]\[en]default\-port\f[R] is in use, the default port
for that scheme is provided here.
.SS parts.path
The path.
Including the leading slash.
.SS parts.query
The full query, excluding the question mark separator.
.SS parts.fragment
The fragment, excluding the pound sign separator.
.SS parts.zoneid
The zone id, which can only be present in an IPv6 address.
When this key is present, then \f[B]host\f[R] is an IPv6 numerical
address.
.SS params
This key contains an array of query key/value objects.
Each such pair is listed with \[lq]key\[rq] and \[lq]value\[rq] and
their respective contents in the output.
.PP
The key/values are extracted from the query where they are separated by
ampersands (\f[B]&\f[R]) \- or the user sets with
\f[B]\[en]query\-separator\f[R].
.PP
The query pairs are listed in the order of appearance in a
left\-to\-right order, but can be made alpha\-sorted with
\f[B]\[en]sort\-query\f[R].
.PP
It is only present if the URL has a query.
