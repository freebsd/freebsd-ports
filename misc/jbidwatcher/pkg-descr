A Java-based application allowing you to monitor ebay auctions,
submit bids, snipe (bid at the last moment), and otherwise track
your auction-site experience. It includes adult-auction management,
MANY currencies (yen, pound, dollar (US, Canada, Australian, and
New Taiwanese), Swiss Francs, and euro, presently), drag-and-drop
of auction URLs, a unique and powerful 'multisniping' feature.
