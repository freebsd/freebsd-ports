The GNU Talk Filters are filter programs that convert ordinary English text
into text that mimics a stereotyped or otherwise humorous dialect. These
filters have been in the public domain for many years, but now for the first
time they are provided as a single integrated package. The filters include
austro, b1ff, brooklyn, chef, cockney, drawl, dubya, fudd, funetak, jethro,
jive, kraut, pansy, postmodern, redneck, valspeak, and warez. Each program
reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
