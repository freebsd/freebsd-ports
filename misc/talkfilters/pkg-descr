The GNU Talk Filters are filter programs that convert ordinary English text
into text that mimics a stereotyped or otherwise humorous dialect. Each
program reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

The filters include:

	austro, b1ff, brooklyn, chef, cockney, drawl, dubya,
	fudd, funetak, jethro, jive, kraut, pansy, pirate,
	postmodern, redneck, valspeak, and warez.
