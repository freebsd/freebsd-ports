These programs and documentation do not come from Tesla Motors Inc.

Be careful when using these programs as they can lock and unlock your
car as well as control various functions relating to the charging system,
sun roof, lights, horn, and other subsystems of the car.

Be careful not to send your login and password to anyone other than Tesla
or you are giving away the authentication details required to control
your car.

Also ensure that you don't overwhelm the Tesla servers with requests.
Calling REST APIs at very high frequency can put substantial load on the
Tesla servers and might get your IP blocked by Tesla.

Use these programs at your own risk. The authors do not guarantee the
proper functioning of these applications. This code attempts to use the
same interfaces used by the official Tesla phone apps. However, it is
possible that use of this code may cause unexpected damage for which
nobody but you are responsible. Use of these functions can change the
settings on your car and may have negative consequences such as (but not
limited to) unlocking the doors, opening the sun roof, or reducing the
available charge in the battery.
