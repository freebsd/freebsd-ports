Services_Weather searches for given locations and retrieves current
weather data and, dependent on the used service, also forecasts. Up to
now, GlobalWeather from CapeScience, Weather XML from EJSE (US only),
a XOAP service from Weather.com and METAR from noaa.gov are supported.
Further services will get included, if they become available, have a
usable API and are properly documented.
