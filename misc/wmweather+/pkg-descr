wmweather+ will download the National Weather Serivce METAR bulletins;
AVN, ETA, and MRF forecasts; and any weather map for display in a
WindowMaker dockapp. Think wmweather with a smaller font, forecasts,
a weather map, and a sky condition display.

You will need to look up the METAR code for your city (a standard code
used in aviation).
