wmweather+ will download the National Weather Serivce METAR bulletins, 
ANV and MRF forecasts, and any weather map for display in a WindowMaker
dockapp. Think wmweather with a smaller font, forecasts, a weather map,
and a sky condition display.

You will need to look up the METAR code for your city (a standard code
used in aviation).
