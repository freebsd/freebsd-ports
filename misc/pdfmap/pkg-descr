A python module to generate maps in PDF format and place clickable
objects on them.

Object types can be represented either by shapes of different forms and
colors (fill and contour), or by user provided images. Each object is
scaled, oriented and positionned on the map.

The more powerful way to use this software is to use its API in your
own programs, this will allow you to produce multipage documents with
different sizes, orientations, scales, background, etc... from page to
page.
