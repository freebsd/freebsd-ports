This module allows you to convert the full name for a countries
administrative region to the code commonly used for postal addressing.
The reverse lookup can also be done. Sub country codes are defined
in "ISO 3166-2:1998, Codes for the representation of names of
countries and their subdivisions".

Sub countries are termed as states in the US and Australia, provinces
in Canada and counties in the UK and Ireland.

Additionally, names and codes for all sub countries in a country
can be returned as either a hash or an array.
