qtchooser is a wrapper that allows selecting whether Qt4 or Qt5 binaries for
qmake, moc and other tools will be run when invoking the binaries in $PATH.

By default, the Qt5 versions are run. It is possible to change the behavior by
setting the QT_SELECT environment variable to "qt4". See qtchooser(1) for more
information.
