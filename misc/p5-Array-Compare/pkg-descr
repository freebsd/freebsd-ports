Array::Compare is a Perl module which allows you to compare two arrays.

It has a number of features which allow you to control the way that
the arrays are compared:

* white space in array elements can be significant or ignored.

* particular columns in the arrays can be ignored.

Additionally you can get a simple true/false return value or the number
of columns which differ or an array containing the indexes of the
differing columns.
