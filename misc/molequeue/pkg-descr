MoleQueue is an open-source, cross-platform, system-tray resident desktop
application for abstracting, managing, and coordinating the execution of tasks
both locally and on remote computational resources. It is built and tested on
Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, with nightly binaries currently available for Mac
OS X and Windows. Users can set up local and remote queues that describe where
the task will be executed. Each queue can have programs, with templates to
facilitate the execution of the program. Input files can be staged, and output
files collected using a standard interface.

The MoleQueue application is written in C++ using the Qt framework. It can
execute programs directly on the local machine, and uses SSH to communicate with
remote batch scheduling systems with support for Open Grid Scheduler (formerly
Sun Grid Engine) and PBS. The backend communication is abstracted, and support
is currently being added for UIT (a SOAP protocol for communicating with
military HPC resources using ezHPC).
