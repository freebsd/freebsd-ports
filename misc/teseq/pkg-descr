GNU Teseq is a tool for translating files that contain control
characters and terminal control sequences, into human-understandable
text. It is intended to aid in debugging problems in terminal
emulators, software that makes use of special terminal features, and
interactions between the two.

Teseq is primarily targeted at individuals who possess a basic
understanding of terminal control sequences, especially CSI sequences;
however, by default Teseq will try to identify and describe the
sequences that it encounters, and the behavior they might produce in a
terminal.

Teseq describes control functions as they are interpreted by
VT100-compatible terminals, and/or terminals compliant with the ECMA-48 /
ISO/IEC 6429 standard. Teseq does _not_ support describing control
functions according to terminal-specific definitions in a database such
as termcap or terminfo, though future versions may include limited
support for that (*note Future Enhancements::). Therefore, the
descriptions Teseq uses for control functions may not necessarily match
their actual interpretation by whatever terminal device the characters
were actually intended for
