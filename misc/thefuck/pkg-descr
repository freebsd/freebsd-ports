Thefuck is a magnificent app which corrects your previous console command.
It tries to match a rule for the previous command, creates a new command
using the matched rule and runs it. Thefuck comes with a lot of predefined
rules, but you can create your own rules as well.

You should place this command in your shell config file:

eval $(thefuck --alias)
