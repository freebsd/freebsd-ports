DLPack is an open in-memory tensor structure for sharing tensors among
frameworks.

DLPack enables:
* Easier sharing of operators between deep learning frameworks.
* Easier wrapping of vendor level operator implementations, allowing
  collaboration when introducing new devices/ops.
* Quick swapping of backend implementations, like different version of BLAS
* For final users, this could bring more operators, and possibility of mixing
  usage between frameworks.
