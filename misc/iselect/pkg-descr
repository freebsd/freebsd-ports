iSelect is an interactive line selection tool for ASCII files, operating
via a full-screen Curses-based terminal session. It can be used either as
an user interface frontend controlled by a Bourne-Shell/Perl/Tcl backend
as its control script or in batch mode as a pipeline filter (usually
between grep and the final executing command).
