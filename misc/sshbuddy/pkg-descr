This is a Expectk script that allows you to save time connecting to different 
hosts using ssh.  It saves your password, login ID, and other host info that 
you have to type over and over again to connect.   Once you save your 
connection information you can connect to a host with 2 clicks.   First you 
choose the name and then hit connect. It will save you a lot of time.
