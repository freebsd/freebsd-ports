Ree stands for ROM extension extractor. Ree will scan your system memory,
address c0000 - f0000 in 512 steps for identification of ROM extensions
(55,aa), if found it will calculate its size (byte after id, multiplied by
512byte steps) and save the output to a .rom file.

This package also comes with fontdump, a program to extract the fonts from your
video BIOS ROMs.

You might ask yourself why collect x86 ROM extensions? It's like collecting
butterflies.

A collection of various .rom files can be found on the project page. Please
submit your ROMs there.
