Business::ISBN uses this "data pack" to do its work. You can update
Business::ISBN::Data independently of the main module as the various
ISBN organizations assign new publisher codes. The ISBN agency lists
these data at http://www.isbn-international.org/identifiers.html.

The distribution should include the kludegy script used to extract the
data and format the data structure.
