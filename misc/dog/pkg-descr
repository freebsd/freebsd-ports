Dog, better than cat.

Dog writes the contents of each given file,  URL,  or  the standard
input if none are given or when a file named '-' is given, to the
standard output.  It  currently  supports the  file,  http,  and
raw URL types. It is designed as a compatible, but enhanced,
replacement of cat(1).
