pyOBD (aka pyOBD-II or pyOBD2) is an OBD-II compliant car diagnostic tool.
It is designed to interface with low-cost ELM 32x OBD-II diagnostic interfaces
such as ELM-USB. It will basically allow you to talk to your car's ECU, ...
display fault codes, display measured values, read status tests, etc. All cars
made since 1996 (in the US) or 2001 (in the EU) must be OBD-II compliant, i.e.
they should work with pyOBD.

pyOBD is written entirely in Python and was originally written by Donour
Sizemore, now maintained and improved by SECONS Ltd. and it is Free Software
and is distributed under the terms of the GPL.
