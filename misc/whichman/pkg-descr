Approximate matching searching utilities to search for manpages and files.

This package holds THREE little search utilities:

* whichman -- search utility for man pages and it works
  much like the well known unix command "where".

* ftff -- a fault tolerant file finder

  ftff works like the whichman above but searches the directory
  tree. This is a case in-sensitive and fault tolerant way of
  'find . -name xxxx -print'

* ftwhich -- a fault tolerant "which" command

  ftwhich finds files (programs) which are in one of the directories in
  your PATH and uses a fault tolerant search algorithem.
