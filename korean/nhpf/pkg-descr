This program makes you can print hangul homepages with Netscape 2.0 or later,
in Unix with PostScript printer (or with Ghostscript).

The filtered PS file is self-contained, because this program appends hangul
fonts, "n3f-5" (N-byte 3BeolSik hangul Font 5), "n3f-5b" (the bold font),
"n3f-5i" and "n3f-5bi" (the slanted version of them) to the output. This means
that you can print hangul homepages with every PostScript printer.
