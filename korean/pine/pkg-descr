pine
----

Pine for FreeBSD 2.x is a tool for reading, sending, and managing
electronic messages.  It was designed specifically with novice
computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the needs
of "power users" as well.  Pine uses Internet message protocols (e.g.
RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and runs on Unix and PCs.  This
package also includes the Pico editor, the IMAP daemon, a POP2 server, 
and a POP3 server.

If you want to use the spell checking feature of pine, set the
environment variable SPELL to "/usr/local/bin/ispell -l".

An optional configuration file "pine.conf" can be put into /usr/local/etc 
to set system wide defaults.  The format of this file is identical to the 
.pinerc file that is auto-generated by pine in your home directory.

It is patched to remove a couple of incompatibilities with RFC 1557 
and Hangul MTA. Patch is by Jungshik Shin <jshin@pantheon.yale.edu>.
