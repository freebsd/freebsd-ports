h2ps
----

h2ps formats each named file for printing in a postscript printer with
embedded PS hangul fonts; if no file is given, h2ps reads from the
standard input. The format used is nice and compact: n(1 to 10) pages
on each physical page, headers with useful information (page number,
printing date), etc. This is very useful for making simple listings of
Korean text.

It is relatively compact when comparing with nh2ps, and no need to another
fonts or ghostscript. It can be printed with any PostScript printer only
with english fonts because its fonts are embedded with output.
