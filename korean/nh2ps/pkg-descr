nh2ps
-----

nh2ps formats each named file for printing in a postscript printer with
PostScript(CID, OCF) or HLaTeX-0.95/7 Type1 Hangul fonts; if no file is 
given, nh2ps reads from the standard input.

The format used is nice and compact: normally two pages on each physical
page, borders surrounding pages, headers with useful information (page
number, printing date, file name or supplied header), line numbering, 
etc. This is very useful for making archive listings of programs.

It is relatively large when comparing with h2ps, and need to another 
installed fonts and ghostscript.
