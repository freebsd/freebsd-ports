  A new ${opt}_CMAKE_BOOL OPTIONS helper has been added. Instead of:

    FOO_CMAKE_ON=	-DWITH_FOO:BOOL=YES -DWITH_BAR:BOOL=YES
    FOO_CMAKE_OFF=	-DWITH_FOO:BOOL=NO  -DWITH_BAR:BOOL=NO

  you can use this shortcut:

    SOMEOPT_CMAKE_BOOL=	WITH_FOO WITH_BAR

  A new stage-qa test has been added, it reports all shared libraries
  dependencies that are not part of the port list of dependencies.  It help
  finds what is called proxy dependencies.

  A is needed by B, and B is needed by C.  If C also needs A, then it needs to
  be registered, and this check will tell you to do so.

  Right now, it is only reporting the problems, but if you add
  PROXYDEPS_FATAL=yes to your environment, it will give an error and will force
  you to fix the dependencies.

  New keyword @xmlcatmgr has been added, to handle the XML and SGML catalog
  maintainance, in order to improve consistency and correctness of the
  generation of the catalog.
  If the catalog file has an extension being '.xml' it will be automatically
  added to the XML catalog, otherwise it will be added to the SGML catalog

  "make makesum" now writes the current timestamp to distinfo when it is run.
  This is done to support development and prototyping efforts for reproducible
  package builds, which require some concept of a "last updated" time.

  The TIMESTAMP can currently be ignored for ports that have no distinfo, and
  for updates done without using "make makesum."

  USE_RUBYGEMS has been replaced by USES=gem.

20160426:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  USE_MYSQL and USE_BDB have been replaced by USES=mysql and USES=bdb.

  WANT_BDB_VER=XX should be replaced by USES=bdb:XX.

20160414:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  USE_RC_SUBR=yes has not done anything for a long time, it will now give an error.

20160413:
AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  Introducing CONFIGURE_OUTSOURCE. It changes HAS_CONFIGURE and GNU_CONFIGURE
  by invoking configure, build and install stage outside of source tree e.g.,

    $ mkdir ../.build
    $ cd ../.build
    $ ${OLDPWD}/configure
    $ gmake
    $ gmake install

20160402:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  Adding ${PORTSDIR} in dependency lines is no longer necessary meaning

  RUN_DEPENDS=  foo:${PORTSDIR}/bar/foo

  can now be written

  RUN_DEPENDS=  foo:bar/foo

  if the path after ':' is not absolute the framework will automatically
  prepend ${PORTSDIR}/

20160301:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Introduce GH_TUPLE.

  GH_TUPLE allows one to put all the GH_{ACCOUNT,PROJECT,TAGNAME} into one
  variable, in the form of account:project:tagname[:group].  It is helpful when
  there are many submodules.

20160207:
AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The GNOME and MATE framework activation changed. To use the frameworks
  now either gnome or mate needs to be added USES.

  The usage of USE_GNOME, USE_MATE, INSTALLS_ICONS and for example
  GLIB_SCHEMAS stays the same.

  Like with USES, the use of USE_GNOME and so after bsd.port.pre.mk
  is now forbidden.

20160112:
AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  Support has been added for "or later" variants of GNU licenses
  (e.g. LICENSE=GPLv2+) and for Public Domain (LICENSE=PD).

  Complete list of new LICENSE values:

  AGPLv3+ GPLv1+ GPLv2+ GPLv3+ GPLv3RLE+ LGPL20+ LGPL21+ LGPL3+ PD

AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  USE_FIREBIRD and USE_SQLITE has been replaced by USES=firebird and
  USES=sqlite

20151105:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Change the meaning of NO_WRKSUBDIR to force a WRKDIR != WRKSRC.

  Right now, NO_WRKSUBDIR means that the extraction does not produce a
  subdirectory, and that everything goes straight into WRKDIR.  It is
  problematic, because during the build of a port, quite a few files
  are created in there, and then, a stage directory, where everything
  is installed, and then a pkg directory where the package is created,
  and those often conflict, or get in the way, of the building
  process.

  With this, NO_WRKSUBDIR will extract the distfiles directly into
  WRKSRC instead of WRKDIR.  In this case, WRKSRC is artificial and is
  based on PKGNAME and not DISTNAME, mitigate conflicts with rc files.

20151022:
AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  Improved support for USES=shebangfix

  - We now support multiple values for *_OLD_CMD
  - We replace more variants by default (/bin/${lang}, /usr/bin/${lang},
    /usr/bin/env ${lang}).
  - shebangfix now also supports lua if USES=lua is specified
  - Pattern matching has been improved: we now only match whole worlds,
    e.g. "/usr/bin/perl5.005" is no longer erroneously replaced with
    "${perl_CMD}5.005".

  Note that *_OLD_CMD entries which contain spaces must now be quoted.

20150928:
AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  Implemented complete support for test target.

  You can now `make test' on any port to run test sequence, no-op by default.
  If a port defines TEST_TARGET, it'll run sub-make with specified target,
  usually `check' or `test', useful if upstream supports that. The port may
  instead define custom do-test target, as well as usual satellite targets:

    {pre,do,post}-test, {pre,do,post}-test-OPT, {pre,do,post}-test-OPT-off

  `make test' builds and stages port first, so test may use both WRKDIR and
  STAGEDIR, and both BUILD and RUN depends are available for test target.
  Additionally, TEST_DEPENDS is now properly supported and may be used to
  define additional depends specifically for testing.

  Framework may define default tests for specific cases. For instance,
  perl5.mk and cran.mk provide default test target on their own.

AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  @sample now accept arguments, so it can now be used the following way:

  @sample afile.sample
  or
  @sample path/to/example etc/target

20150926:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  New keywords are supported in pkg since 1.5.x:
  @preexec <command>: execute the <command> during pre-install scripts
  @postexec <command>: execute the <command> during post-install scripts
  @preunexec <command>: execute the <command> during pre-deinstall scripts
  @postunexec <command>: execute the <command> during post-deinstall scripts

  @exec does not specify when if should be executed and is now considered as
  deprecated.

20150914:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Introducing the %%PERL5_MAN1%% PLIST_SUB entry, as Perl now installs man1
  pages in the same prefix as man3 pages.

20150828:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  <opt>_VARS and <opt>_VARS_OFF have been introduced to allow for a generic way
  to set/append to variables.

  OPT1_VARS=  foo=bar baz+=bam

  will set FOO to bar and append bam to BAZ if OPT1 is enabled.  <opt>_VARS_OFF
  works the same way, if the option is disabled.

20150818:
AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The CMAKE_ENV option has been deprecated. It no longer has any effect, and
  the CONFIGURE_ENV variable should be used instead.

20150818:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  <opt>_IMPLIES and <opt>_PREVENTS have been introduced to register dependency,
  or conflicts between options.

    OPTIONS_DEFINE= FOO BAR BAZ

    FOO_IMPLIES=	BAR
    BAZ_PREVENTS= BAR

  If the FOO option is selected, the BAR option will be enabled as well.  If
  the BAZ and BAR options are both enabled, an error will be given.

20150817:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  UNIQUENAME and LATEST_LINK have been removed. LATEST_LINK was only used by
  ports-mgmt/pkg{,-devel} and PKGBASE can be used in its stead.  UNIQUENAME was
  used by USE_LDCONFIG where it was not unique enough, and as old compat shims
  with options.

20150716:
AUTHOR:	kwm@FreeBSD.org

  USE_GHOSTSCRIPT was replaced by USES=ghostscript. The ghostscript USES
  accepts version, build, run, nox11 and for version 9 the agpl argument.
  If no version is specified, the default 9 for GHOSTSCRIPT_DEFAULT is honored.

20150701:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Make option target helpers have been added, it allows replacing:

    .include <bsd.port.options.mk>

    post-patch:
      ${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|/usr/local|${LOCALBASE}|g' \
	${WRKSRC}/Configure ${WRKSRC}/hints/freebsd.sh
    .if ${PORT_OPTIONS:MPTHREAD}
      ${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|%%PTHREAD_LIBS%%|-lpthread|g;' \

    .else
      ${REINPLACE_CMD} -e 's|%%PTHREAD_LIBS%%||g;' \
	${WRKSRC}/hints/freebsd.sh
    .endif

  with:

    post-patch:

  Remove USE_RCORDER, USE_RC_SUBR has been modified to support PREFIX=/usr
  automatically

AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Extend the multiple distfiles USE_GITHUB framework by allowing it to fetch
  only additional distfiles, but not the main one.  Set USE_GITHUB=nodefault
  and use the GH_* variables with groups as usual.

20150528:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  USE_GITHUB can now fetch multiple distfiles.  It uses a grouping feature
  similar to MASTER_SITES/PATCH_SITES.

  Some helpful variables are provided: WRKSRC_<group> for putting things in the
  right place in post-extract, and DISTNAME_<group>/DISTFILE_<group> for use
  with EXTRACT_ONLY.

  A simple example:

    PORTNAME=     bar
    PORTVERSION=  1.0
    USE_GITHUB= yes
    GH_ACCOUNT= foo
    GH_PROJECT= ${PORTNAME}-images:images

    post-extract:
	    @${MV} ${WRKSRC_images} ${WRKSRC}/images

  It will fetch those two distfiles:

    $ make fetch-urlall-list
    https://codeload.github.com/foo/bar/tar.gz/1.0?dummy=/foo-bar-1.0_GH0.tar.gz
    https://codeload.github.com/foo/bar-images/tar.gz/1.0?dummy=/foo-bar-images-1.0-1.0.tar.gz

  It will then extract them to ${WRKDIR} in their respectives directories.

20150526:
AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  PYTHON_REL has been switched from a 3 digits number to a 4 digits number to
  handle python 2.7.10.  Ports checking for python 2.7.9 should compare
  PYTHON_REL against 2709 and ports checking for python 2.7.10 should compare
  PYTHON_REL against 2710.

20150521:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  GH_COMMIT support has been removed, see the 20150319 for more informations.

20150419:
AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  USE_AUTOTOOLS has been deprecated.  It can be replaced with USES=autoreconf
  and GNU_CONFIGURE=yes.

  Support for USE_AUTOTOOLS=libtoolize has been removed.  It can be replaced
  with "USES=autoreconf libtool".

20150409:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  Add a new USES=gnustep to handle the GNUstep ports. Now the dependencies on
  GNUstep libraries is done via the regular LIB_DEPENDS

  USE_GNUSTEP is now a macro that accept many arguments: back, build, gui, back
  Depending on the feature needed for a given port

  Reuse USES=objc to avoid duplicating code

20150408:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  Add a new USES=waf to handle the waf building system, allowing to factorise
  code. Plug waf into MAKE_CMD and CONFIGURE_CMD so the regular defined targets
  can be reused.

  Always define _MAKE_JOBS so that when bsd.port.mk will stop overwritting
  _MAKE_JOBS when parallel jobs are disabled we can enforce -j1 (which is needed
  to really disable parallelisation with waf

  WAF_CMD has been created to allow one to override the location of the waf
  script relatively to WRKSRC

  CONFIGURE_TARGET is by default defined to "configure"
  ALL_TARGET is by default defined to "build"
  INSTALL_TARGET is by default defined to "install"

  USES=waf is by default stagedir safe

20150407:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  USE_XZ and USE_BZIP2 are not supported anymore, they have been replaced by
  USES=tar:bzip2 and tar:xz

20150328:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  New "metaport" USES to take care of predefining correctly the needed
  macros as expected by meta ports.

20150323:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  Remove "@fc" and "@fontsdir". All fonts should always use @fcfontsdir which
  Properly takes care of the fonts.dir and fonts.scale cache files as well
  as ensure to properly update the fontconfig cache

  New "fonts" USES. It defines the default variables needed for fonts and also
  takes care of the run time dependencies

20150326:
AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  PTHREAD_CFLAGS and PTHREAD_LIBS have been removed.  Please see entry
  20130207 for more information.

20150319:
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  MASTER_SITE GHR (GITHUB_RELEASE) has been removed.  The same functionality
  can be achieved with just USE_GITHUB/GH_ACCOUNT/GH_PROJECT. GH_TAGNAME
  defaults to DISTVERSION. If the tag needs to be adjusted then change
  GH_TAGNAME. No GH_COMMIT is needed.

20150319:
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  USE_GITHUB has been updated to make GH_COMMIT optional.  Using this new
  scheme allows only setting the _tag_ or _commit hash_ in GH_TAGNAME and
  not having to know the hash for a tag.  This scheme will download a tarball
  that has a different checksum than before due to a changed directory name
  for extraction.

  GH_TAGNAME can now be any length of the hash as long as it is unique.  There
  is no longer a 7-character requirement.

  The following MASTER_SITES are provided to retain the old checksum and
  directory structure (that require GH_COMMIT):
    GH -> GHL
    GITHUB -> GITHUB_LEGACY

20150305:
  AUTHOR: olivierd@FreeBSD.org

  Dependencies on the Xfce ports have been migrated to USES. Instead
  of USE_XFCE= configenv, you should use USES= xfce.

20150224:
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  New USE_QT4 component has been introduced to reduce buildtime
  dependencies for Qt 4 ports that use localization support. Instead
  of USE_QT4=linguist you should now use USE_QT4=linguisttools_build.
  Conversion of existing ports may require USE_QT4 adjustment for
  missing components.

20141217:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl now links libperl.so with all .so it builds.  The stage-qa checks have
  been extended to check that libperl.so is in fact linked with .so in
  SITE_ARCH and errors out if none of the .so build by a port are linked with
  it.  It also checks that the rpath and runpath elf attributes are present.

20141130:
AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/gettext port has been split up in devel/gettext-runtime which
  contains runtime libraries such as libintl, and devel/gettext-tools which
  contains build tools such as msgfmt.  You can use USES=gettext-runtime to
  set a LIB/BUILD/RUN_DEPENDS on devel/gettext-runtime and USES=gettext-tools
  to set a BUILD/RUN_DEPENDS on devel/gettext-tools.

  USES=gettext is now the same as "USES=gettext-runtime gettext-tools",
  meaning a LIB_DEPENDS on devel/gettext-runtime and a BUILD_DEPENDS on
  devel/gettext-tools.

20141126:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The way Perl modules are installed has changed.  Before, we had

    site_perl :           lib/perl5/site_perl/5.18
    site_perl/perl_arch : lib/perl5/site_perl/5.18/mach
    perl_man3 :           lib/perl5/5.18/man/man3

  Now we have :

    site_perl : lib/perl5/site_perl
    site_arch : lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18
    perl_man3 : lib/perl5/site_perl/man/man3

  Modules without any .so will be installed at the same place regardless of the
  Perl version, minimizing the upgrade when the major Perl version is changed.
  It uses a version dependent directory for modules with compiled bits.

  As PERL_ARCH is no longer needed in plists, it has been removed from
  PLIST_SUB.

  The USE_PERL5=fixpacklist keyword is removed, the .packlist file is now
  always removed, as is perllocal.pod.

  The old site_perl and site_perl/arch directories have been kept in the
  default Perl @INC for all Perl ports, and will be phased out as these old
  Perl versions expire.

20141122:
AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Dependencies on the PostgreSQL ports have been migrated
  to USES. Instead of USE_PGSQL, please use USES=pgsql instead.

    USE_PGSQL=yes becomes USES=pgsql
    WANT_PGSQL_VER=91+ becomes USES=pgsql:9.1+
    USE_PGSQL=server becomes USES=pgsql and WANT_PGSQL=server

20141118:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  To ease future work, a new SITE_ARCH variable and PLIST_SUB replacement
  containing SITE_PERL/PERL_ARCH has been added.

20141102:
AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  SSP is now default. This can be disabled with WITHOUT_SSP.
  SSP_CFLAGS defaults to -fstack-protector.
  SSP will be used on all amd64 releases. It will only be used on i386
  releases over 10.0.

20141007:
AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The @cwd [path] construct in plist files is deprecated.  Instead of adding
  those lines to the plist:

  @cwd /
  etc/rc.d/foo
  var/db/bar
  @cwd /some
  @exec mkdir -p %D/nested/dir

  add this:

  /etc/rc.d/foo
  /var/db/bar
  @exec mkdir -p /some/nested/dir

20141002:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  New BUNDLE_LIBS knobs to allow a port to tell pkg(8) not to compute provided
  libraries, this is to be used when a port bundles libraries it doesn't want
  to expose to other ports.

20141001:
AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  Support for autoconf213, autoheader213, aclocal14 and automake14 has been
  removed from USE_AUTOTOOLS.

20140930:
AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Building ports in a chroot or jail have always required a particular
  environment be setup. This was not clear though and the ports framework
  did not enforce it. These requirements are:
    1. Either a SRC_BASE/sys/sys/param.h, or /usr/include/sys/param.h be
       present with the __FreeBSD_version_ number of the target system,
       or OSVERSION be set in the environment. Lack of these would fallback
       on kern.osreldate before, which is no longer the case.
    2. UNAME_r,UNAME_v,UNAME_s all must be set for the target system.

  Not having these values in sync will now cause the build to error until it is
  resolved.

  Setting these in the environment can be done via your own wrapper scripts,
  or /etc/login.conf (along with cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf) or
  via /etc/make.conf using appropriate values. Note that OSVERSION is redundant
  if a proper param.h is in the environment:

    OSVERSION+=     1100036
    UNAME_ENV+=     OSVERSION=${OSVERSION}
    UNAME_ENV+=     UNAME_s=FreeBSD
    UNAME_ENV+=     UNAME_r=11.0-CURRENT
    UNAME_ENV+=     UNAME_v="${UNAME_s} ${UNAME_r}"
    .MAKEFLAGS:     ${UNAME_ENV}
    MAKE_ENV+=      ${UNAME_ENV}
    CONFIGURE_ENV+= ${UNAME_ENV}
    SCRIPTS_ENV+=   ${UNAME_ENV}

20140922:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  pkg(8) now handles the directories under PREFIX automatically,
  and will automatically remove them as needed.
  A new @dir keyword has been introduced to handle directories specially:
  - directories with special owner, group, or permissions (access mode)
  - empty directories
  - directories out of PREFIX
  As a consequence @dirrm and @dirrmtry are now considered deprecated.

  Credentials can now be passed in arguments to keywords
  (the empty keyword means "regular file"):
  @(user,group,mode) file1
  @dir(user,group,mode) directory_with_special_owner_or_mode

  PLIST_DIRSTRY is now considered deprecated, use PLIST_DIRS instead.

20140917:
AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  Support for USE_AUTOTOOLS=libtool, USE_GNOME=ltasneededhack,
  USE_GNOME=lthack and USE_GNOME=ltverhack has been removed.
  Ports should use USES=libtool instead.

  Support for USE_AUTOTOOLS=libltdl has been removed.
  Ports should use LIB_DEPENDS=libltdl.so:${PORTSDIR}/devel/libltdl

20140916:
AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The installation of *.la files without some form of USES=libtool in the
  port Makefile will now result in a stage-qa error.
  Previously this would only cause a warning.

  The :keepla argument to USES=libtool is no longer special.  It is now
  only needed if a port uses *.la files at run time and no longer to fix
  link problems in other ports.

20140901:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  Support for pkg_install has been removed.
  Note that WITH_PKGNG is now called WITH_PKG (still used to define 'devel')
  WITH_PKGNG remains for compatibility
  @stopdaemon support has gone, pkg(8) has a generic mechanism to
  provide the same function, see HANDLE_RC_SCRIPTS in pkg.conf(5).

  Support for NOPORTDATA has been removed.

20140809:
AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The Python language bits of the ports framework have been converted
  to USES. Instead of USE_PYTHON, please use USES=python instead.

    USE_PYTHON=yes becomes USES=python
    USE_PYTHON=2.7+ becomes USES=python:2.7+
    USE_PYTHON_BUILD=3.3 becomes USES=python:3.3,build
    ...

  Additionally, several Python specific features have been converted
  to USES-inspired USE_PYTHON=<featureA>,<featureB>.

    USE_PYDISTUTILS becomes USE_PYTHON=distutils
    PYDISTUTILS_AUTOPLIST becomes USE_PYTHON=autoplist
    ...

  Please read the header comments of Uses/python.mk for more details
  about the new and changed bits and pieces. You will find a list of
  deprecated variables and how to replace them in your own ports at
  the end of the header comment.

  Support for installations based on the easy_install setup.py target has
  been removed from the Ports framework for Python software. The
  PYEASYINSTALL_* knobs and support for USE_PYDISTUTILS=easy_install have
  been removed.

  IGNOREFILES is not supported anymore, it was an unsafe feature allowing to
  use unchecked files downloaded from untrusted places to be used in the ports
  tree.

20140607:
AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  New PYTHON_CONCURRENT_INSTALL knob to support the parallel installation
  of ports for different python versions.

  If set to yes, the knob indicates that the port can be installed for
  different python versions at the same time. The port will use a unique
  prefix for certain directories using USES=uniquefiles:dirs (see the
  uniquefiles.mk Uses for details about the directories). Binaries
  receive an additional suffix, based on ${PYTHON_VER}.

  The values for the uniquefiles USES are set as follows:

    UNIQUE_PREFIX=  ${PYTHON_PKGNAMEPREFIX}
    UNIQUE_SUFFIX=  -${PYTHON_VER}

  If the port is installed for the current default python version, scripts and
  binaries in

    ${PREFIX}/bin
    ${PREFIX}/sbin
    ${PREFIX}/libexec

  are linked from the prefixed version to the prefix-less original name,
  e.g. bin/foo-2.7 --> bin/foo.

  The semantics of USES=libtool have changed.  It now deletes .la libraries
  from the staging area to reduce overlinking.  USES=libtool:keepla can be
  used in case they need to be kept.  This form still modifies .la libraries
  to remove references to other libraries to reduce overlinking.

  Note that .la libraries have to kept around as long as there are .la
  libraries from other ports that refer to them.  Those ports need to use
  some form of USES=libtool first such that those references are removed.

  check-orphans has been renamed to check-plist. It now checks:
    A. Files in STAGEDIR that are missing from plist.
       To make check-plist ignore a file *as an orphan* do one of the
       following:
        1. Install it
        2. post-install: ${RM} ${STAGEDIR}file
        3. Put the file behind an OPTION with a PLIST_SUB: %%OPTION%%file
        4. Add to plist as a @comment
           @comment file
           @comment @dirrmtry dir

  New USES=uniquefiles to make files or directories unique
  by adding a prefix or suffix to them.

  Files listed in UNIQUE_PREFIX_FILES will receive the prefix
  set via UNIQUE_PREFIX. The same applies to UNIQUE_SUFFIX_FILES,
  but with the chosen UNIQUE_SUFFIX. UNIQUE_PREFIX and
  UNIQUE_SUFFIX are set to PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX by
  default.
  The uniquefiles USES enables ports to name files in special
  ways, e.g. by outlining that the port does not support X11
  (-nox11). A binary named bin/foo thus can be easily renamed
  to bin/foo-featureA via

  USES=			uniquefiles
  UNIQUE_SUFFIX=	-featureA
  UNIQUE_SUFFIX_FILES=	bin/foo

  The uniquefiles USES automatically adjusts the plist at
  installation time. There is no need to consider the prefix
  or suffix in the pkg-plist file itself. If the original name
  of the renamed file is bin/foo, this exact name should be put
  into pkg-plist.

  The dirs argument to USES=uniquefiles will cause certain
  standard directories, such as DOCSDIR or EXAMPLESDIR to be
  prepended with the UNIQUE_PREFIX. The change to the directories
  will hapen prior to configuring or building the port, so that
  the port Makefile as well as the port's build logic are aware
  of the changed name.

  Since the uniquefiles USES effectively manipulates the port's
  installation and file layout, it will only be available for
  stagedir-aware ports. Ports with NO_STAGE=yes will be unable
  to use the uniquefiles USES.

  lang/python (and as such the 'python' binary and accomplices)
  has been removed as default dependency for the USE_PYTHON,
  USE_PYTHON_BUILD and USE_PYTHON_RUN knobs.

  Ports need to use a designated (default) python interpreter
  to build and install and in most cases for execution in the user
  environment. Ports that install python scripts, which are not
  limited to a certain python version (or version range), can
  include lang/python as build and/or run dependency.

  USE_PYTHON=yes and similar knobs will only pull in the
  default python version (e.g. lang/python27), but none
  of the meta ports or lang/python itself.

  Please use lang/python as build or run-time dependency only,
  if there is no other way to get a port working properly, since
  the usage of lang/python complicates package builds for different
  python versions.

  The USE_GNOME component ltverhack no longer has a hard dependancy on
  libtool.

  If USE_AUTOTOOLS=libtool isn't defined it will try to patch ltmain.sh

  in ${WRKSRC} then it is possible to overwrite ltverhack_PATCH_FILES
  with there new locations. configure script --distable-static will work also

  New "compiler" USES to be able to select the compiler based on the
  features it provides.

  library it uses, implies features
  - c++11-lib: the port needs a c++11 standard library, implies features
  - c11: the ports needs a c11 aware compiler implies features
  - features: this will create a COMPILER_FEATURES variable which contains
  the list of features ${CC} do support, implies env.
  - env: the COMPILER_TYPE will be set to either gcc or clang.

  By default the uses will try to use clang33 from ports when nothing in

  Stage aware ports can now create package without the requirement from
  being root.
  If a port really needs root anyway it should add NEED_ROOT in its

  For a port that needs special credential on files DO NOT RELY on
  chown in post-install section but rely on @own, @group in pkg-plist
  Be careful about rights on directories as pkg_install cannot store them
  they needs to be done via @exec chown.

  The ports tree is now staged by default. With pkgng the sequence hasn't
  changed, the main difference is that creating package is now independent
  from installing it. With pkg_install, the package is now created first
  and make install, do install the package.

  New macros:
  - STAGEDIR: PATH to the directory where the port will be staged.
  - NO_STAGE: Keep the old behaviour of the ports tree (aka no staging area)

  Unsupported macro if NO_STAGE is not set:
  - MAN* with staging man page compression and handling of hardlinks and
  symlinks is automatically done in the stage. the manpages becomes then a
  "normal" plist files and should be tracked in pkg-plist.
  - MANCOMPRESSED the compress-man target is able to only compress when it
  needed.

  New target:
  - stage: this installs everything into the stage directory
  - makeplist: this will create a pkg-plist and print it to stdout. This is
  a sample plist and it should always be _reviewed_ not directly used.

  NOTE: with staging only what is in the plist will be installed, nothing more,
  meaning a port staged cannot have leftovers except directories left. It is
  really important to double check the pkg-plist to make sure all the files
  the maintainer wants to package are in! make makeplist can help in that area.

  SSP support has been added to ports with WITH_SSP_PORTS for i386 and amd64
  on FreeBSD 10, and amd64 on earlier versions.

  SSP_UNSAFE is added to disable in a port if it fails to build, but
  this should only be used in rare circumstances such as kernel modules.
  Otherwise, the port may just be failing due to lack of respecting
  LDFLAGS.

  On FreeBSD 10, this uses an ldscript in /usr/lib/libc.so to pull in
  libssp_nonshared.a to address issues linking on i386 [1].

  On earlier FreeBSD versions the WITH_SSP_PORTS knob will add -lssp_nonshared
  to LDFLAGS on i386. This is not needed on amd64. However, several hundred
  ports do not currently respect LDFLAGS, so this support is disabled currently
  as it causes build failures if a dependency is looking for the stack_chk
  symbols.

  * CCACHE support for building ports has been added (depends on
    devel/ccache). Therefore new user settable variables are available:

    WITH_CCACHE_BUILD - Enable CCACHE support (Default off)

    NO_CCACHE         - Disable CCACHE support for example for certain
                        ports if CCACHE is enabled.

    By default CCACHE uses $HOME/.ccache as cache directory. To use
    a non-default cache directory this could be overwritten like:

    MAKE_ENV+= CCACHE_DIR=/var/cache/ccache

  * GitHub support has been integrated into bsd.sites.mk. In order to
    fetch distfiles from GitHub, a port must define USE_GITHUB along
    with the following variables:

    GH_ACCOUNT  - account name of the GitHub user hosting the project
                  default: not set, mandatory

    GH_PROJECT  - name of the project on GitHub
                  default: ${PORTNAME}

    GH_TAGNAME  - name of the tag to download (master, 2.0.1, ...)
                  default: ${DISTVERSION}

    GH_COMMIT   - first 7 digits of the commit that generated GH_TAGNAME
                  (man git-describe(1))
                  default: not set, mandatory

    The port www/tivoka is an example how to use this mechanism.

  * The ports tree moved from CVS to Subversion. A Subversion to
    CVS exporter is in place to continue the support of CVSup but
    do not commit to pcvs directly.

    All commits have to be done in the new port Subversion repository
    on svn.FreeBSD.org. You will find more information about
    Subversion in the Ports Subversion Primer in the FreeBSD wiki,
    in the "Committer's Guide" and the "Porter's Handbook".

  * LDFLAGS is now passed to both the configure and make environments,
    and should be handled just like CPPFLAGS (see previous entry).

    Summarizing both LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS changes, where you would
    have used
      CONFIGURE_ENV=    CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include" \
                        LDFLAGS="-L${LOCALBASE}/lib"
      MAKE_ENV=         CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include" \
                        LDFLAGS="-L${LOCALBASE}/lib"
    now just use
      CPPFLAGS+=        "-I${LOCALBASE}/include"
      LDFLAGS+=         "-L${LOCALBASE}/lib"

    Note that it's advised to append these variables (+=) instead
    of overriding (=) to allow customization by user.

  * CPPFLAGS is now passed to both the configure and make environments,
    so this no longer needs to happen in individual ports by adding this
    to CONFIGURE_ENV or MAKE_ENV.  Rather, just set CPPFLAGS in the port
    Makefile (if necessary).

    For example, where you would have used
      CONFIGURE_ENV=    CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include"
      MAKE_ENV=         SOMETHING=foo CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include"

	korean/ghostscript-gnu-korfont -> print/ghostscript7-korfont

  * USE_GHOSTSCRIPT now supports a version number which the port
    requires.  The valid value is "7" or "8".  If other value is
    specified, value of WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_VER is used.

  * WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_GNU has been removed in favor of

  * The Perl-related code parts have been extracted from bsd.port.mk to
    bsd.perl.mk.  This includes the user-settable knobs (e.g. USE_PERL5)
    and infrastructure parts of the code, like default targets.  The new
    code is designed to be conditionally included based on either
    USE_PERL5_*, PERL_CONFIGURE, or PERL_MODBUILD being set.  However,
    some of the default settings remain in bsd.port.mk while we make
    sure that all ports comply with this.

  * A convenient version handling has been implemented for Perl-related
    knobs.  With this new feature one can require a minimal, a maximal or an
    exact version, that the given port needs.  For the full description and
    some examples, please see the documentation in bsd.perl.mk.

The following functional changes were made to bsd.*.mk and to
Tools/scripts/security-check.awk:

  * The variable definitions that cover command line tools, e.g. MKDIR, were
    extracted from bsd.port.mk into bsd.commands.mk, so that we can
    reuse them within the infrastructure later.

  * The old DESTDIR implementation was removed both from the infrastructure,
    and from the individual ports.  Variables like TARGETDIR should not longer
    be used.

  * A new DESTDIR implementation has been added, implemented in bsd.destdir.mk.
    The new implementation puts no requirements on the individual ports.

The following changes were made to the ports infrastructure:

  * The 'make-deinstall-all' target now checks for moved ports.

  * The installation directories PORTEXAMPLES and PORTDATA are now defined.

  * The USE_MAKESELF knob is added for ports that use the makeself archiver.

  * The description of fetch-list was updated.  The targets fetch-required-list,
    fetch-url-list, and fetch-urlall-list were added.

  * 'make search' will also now search in ports/MOVED.

  * The default method for 'make update' is now portsnap.  Previously,
    you had to manually select one of 3 methods: SUP_UPDATE, CVS_UPDATE,
    or PORTSNAP_UPDATE.  The latter is now obsolete.

  * Several Makevar definitions have been moved to the pre-makefile section:
    DATADIR, DOCSDIR, ETCDIR, EXAMPLESDIR, WWWDIR.

The following changes were made to the ports infrastructure:

  * The default dependency of USE_GHOSTSCRIPT has been changed from
    ghostscript-gnu to ghostscript-gpl.  The WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_GPL variable is
    now no-op.  New WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_GNU variable was added.

  * bsd.tcl.mk was overhauled.  Most importantly, the semantics of USE_TCL* and
    USE_TK* variables was changed.  USE_TCL and USE_TK now implies both build
    and run dependencies, USE_TCL_RUN and USE_TK_BUILD variables were
    introduced. Existing ports in the tree were modified.

  * Unused category 'tcl81' was removed, and new categories 'tcl' and 'tk'
    were added.

The following changes were made to the ports infrastructure:

  * Default LIBTOOLFILES value was changed from literal `configure'

  * bsd.efl.mk was moved to ports/Mk.  USE_EFL family of macros is now
    generally available to all ports.

  * New macros COPYTREE_BIN and COPYTREE_SHARE were added, to allow
    for easy installation of a tree hierarchy, either with executable (bin)
    or read-only (share) permissions on files.

  * A new variable WWWDIR was added, with default value of
    ${PREFIX}/www/${PORTNAME}.

  * Variables DOCSDIR_REL, DATADIR_REL, EXAMPLESDIR_REL and WWWDIR_REL were
    added for porter's convenience.  They contain the values of their
    respective non-REL variables, except relative to installation PREFIX.

The following changes were made to the ports infrastructure:

  * DEPENDS variable was removed, please use other *_DEPENDS variables instead.

  * A new pkg-plist keyword is available, @stopdaemon.  It will call forcestop
    on all rc.subr scripts installed by the port on deinstall, effectively
    stopping services on deinstall/upgrade.

  * rc.subr script suffix is now available in Makefile as RC_SUBR_SUFFIX.

  * New variable USE_CDRTOOLS was introduced.  It replaced direct dependencies
    on sysutils/cdrtools port.  It now automatically support switching to
    cdrtools-cjk port when user specified WITH_CJK.  All ports were converted.

  * USE_DOS2UNIX, infrastructure for converting DOS to UNIX line feeds, was
    enhanced by a new variable DOS2UNIX_REGEX.  It allows to specify a find
    -iregex parameter to limit touched files by file extensions.

  * Support for partially translated manpages was added.  For examples of
    usage, please refer to Porter's Handbook.

  * USE_TCL/USE_TK variables were changed to provide runtime dependency.  New
    variables USE_TCL_BUILD and USE_TK_BUILD were added.  All unintuitive
    quirks of these variables were fixed.

  * USE_LDCONFIG was fixed to work properly for ports, that specify @cwd in the
    pkg-plists.

  * Old bsd.java.mk version 1.0 macros were removed.

  * New category: ports-mgmt

  * New virtual category: gnustep

  * Unused 'picobsd' category was removed.

The following functional changes were made to bsd.port.mk:

  * The bsd.port.mk pre and post includes have been split into 3 pieces
    instead of 2, to allow OPTIONS to be able to influence dependencies.
    This is still experimental and not yet enabled by any port.  This adds
    the file 'bsd.port.options.mk'.

  * bsd.gcc.mk has been updated to understand gfortran.

  * emulators/linux_base is now removed.  linux_base-fc4 has been the default
    for some time.

  * The USE_FIREBIRD macro was added to bsd.database.mk.

 The following functional changes were made to bsd.port.mk:

  * PKGVERSION was introduced as an intermediate variable refactored out of

  * bsd.lua.mk was added to support lua-related ports.

  * DESTDIR was removed from bsd.scons.mk because it was problematic.

  * Some quotes were added to the 'missing' target to improve handling of
    duplicate origins.

The following functional changes were made to bsd.sites.mk:

  * MASTER_SITES variable can now look like MACRO1/subdir1 MACRO2/subdir2, and
    be expanded in a way that you expect it to, that is apply different subdirs
    to different sites. You can safely replace ${M_S_FOO:S/%SUBDIR%/bar/} with
    FOO/bar.

  * If M_S_SUBDIR is unset, a macro in M_S won't set it anymore, but rather
    substitute %SUBDIR% all by itself. Now it's possible to use macros with
    different default subdirs and they will expand in a proper way.

20060805:
AUTHOR:	sat@FreeBSD.org
The following functional changes were made to bsd.sites.mk:

  * MASTER_SITES variable can now contain special macros which are expanded into
    traditional URL[:group] syntax and cause some convenient effects, e.g. set a
    default M_S_SUBDIR.

  * A macro is any space-delimited word in MASTER_SITES without a forward slash.

  * If MASTER_SITE_<macro> is defined, then the macro is expanded to its value.

  * Abbreviated macros are provided for extremely popular locations, e.g. CPAN
    and SF. To avoid further obfuscation their unabbreviated equivalents should
    be avoided.

  * Popular macros can trigger M_S_SUBDIR to default to a predefined value, e.g.
    ${PORTNAME:L} for SF and ${PORTNAME:C/-.*//} for CPAN.

  * Abbreviations and M_S_SUBDIR defaults are defined by MASTER_SITES_ABBREVS
    and MASTER_SITES_SUBDIRS, both set in bsd.sites.mk.

  * If a macro belongs to a group (e.g. SF:source1), all the sites it expands
    into also belong to the same group.

  * Macros and traditional URL's can be mixed safely, their order stays intact.

The following functional changes were made to bsd.*.mk and to
Tools/scripts/security-check.awk:

  * Add DESTDIR support to let one install ports into a jail from outside.
    A package is installed under ${DESTDIR}${PREFIX} now and registered under
    ${DESTDIR}/var/db/pkg.

  * TARGETDIR variable has been added for referencing ${DESTDIR}${PREFIX}.

  * LOCALBASE, LINUXBASE and X11BASE variables point to the final destination
    now, LOCALBASE_REL, LINUXBASE_REL and X11BASE_REL can be used for the
    old behavior.  The behavior has not been changed in PLIST_SUB.
    Note, that the three variables are still overridable with a hack, so this
    change doesn't affect POLA, but necessary for DESTDIR support.

  * OSVERSION is now determined from the userland, not from the kernel.
    Cross-compiling between releases is still not supported, but this
    behavior is more correct for jails with differing userland from
    the kernel version.

  * Add some sanity check for PREFIX and DESTDIR.  This can be skipped by
    defining IGNORE_PATH_CHECKS, but very discouraged.

  * Deinstalling from DESTDIR, determining if a port is already installed in
    DESTDIR, etc. are implemented by chrooting those specific commands.

  * Text changes to reflect that we are installing to DESTDIR, removing from
    DESTDIR, etc.

Note, that this change implements only the infrastructure support.  Ports should
also be implemented to respect DESTDIR.

  * Deprecate INSTALLS_SHLIB and replace it by USE_LDCONFIG.  If set to "yes",
    the old behavior is preserved.  Otherwise, it can be set to a list of

    Note that this directory is used by ldconfig startup script, it is meant
    to replace ldconfig scripts installed by some ports as (sometimes

  * New USE_DOS2UNIX variable for converting DOS linefeeds to UNIX

  * Variables like BROKEN and FORBIDDEN should no longer be quoted

  * New NOFETCHFILES variable to prevent downloading from MASTER_SITES

  GNOME has been upgraded from 2.10.2 to 2.12.1.  This update brings with
  it many important porting changes:

  - gtk20's pkg-config file no longer contains the X11 pango modules.
    Therefore, if your port requires these modules, you may have to
    manually patch them in to your port's Makefiles.  Contact
    gnome@FreeBSD.org if you have questions on this.

  - A new USE_GNOME component, ltverhack, has been added.  This
    pseudo-component hacks libtool so that shared library versions are
    more consistent with other operating systems.  Using this component
    can prevent unnecessary shared library version changes.

  - A new macro, INSTALLS_ICONS, has been added.  If your port installs
    Freedesktop-style icons to ${LOCALBASE}/share/icons or
    ${X11BASE}/share/icons, then you should use this macro.  NOTE:
    use of this macro requires your port to set either USE_GNOME or
    WANT_GNOME.

  - USE_LINUX now implies NO_FILTER_SHLIBS=yes. It also doesn't use FreeBSD
    tools to strip binaries anymore, so it's not necessary anymore to override
    STRIP and STRIP_CMD.
  - USE_LINUX_PREFIX implies NO_MTREE now.
  - In the USE_LINUX case, USE_XLIB now depends upon the Linux X11 libraries
    instead upon the native FreeBSD libraries.
  - The variable LINUX_BASE_PORT contains a string which is suitable as an
    item in *_DEPENDS, so if a port BATCH_DEPENDS or FETCH_DEPENDS upon the
    default (or overridden) Linux base, ${LINUX_BASE_PORT} should be used
    instead of a hardcoded reference.
  - If USE_LINUX or OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE doesn't point to an existing linux_base
    port and if USE_LINUX isn't set to "yes" (case insensitive), the port will
    be marked as IGNORE.

The following changes were introduced:

  * Improve documentation of CONFLICTS.

  * Fix add-plist-docs target to work correctly with wildcards.

  * Fix USE_MYSQL and USE_PGSQL knobs to work in partial ports
    tree.

  * Introduce 2 new variables: USE_FAM and WANT_FAM_SYSTEM.

  * Suppress "Vulnerability check disabled" message if
    DISABLE_VULNERABILITIES is defined.

  * Switch default MySQL version to 4.1

  * Add support for OpenLDAP v.23

  * Fix add-plist-info and add-plist-post targets to avoid warnings
    from ports which redefine them.

  * Fix add-plist-docs target to handle NOPORTDOCS knob properly.

  * Use INSTALLDIRS="site" in configure for perl ports.

  * Fix NO_(CHECKSUM|BUILD|INSTALL|PACKAGE) knobs if OPTIONS are
    defined.

  * Add an ability to depend on versioned installed package.
    Example:

          BUILD_DEPENDS=p5-Tree-Simple>=1.12:${PORTSDIR}/devel/p5-Tree-Simple

    Please note, it's experimental feature, work is currently in
    progress.

  The CVSup port has been upgraded with a patch to correct the
  handling of the "refuse" file for files that are in the CVS Attic.
  This solves a problem some people were having, where CVSup would
  delete their ports/INDEX* files even though the files were listed
  in the "refuse" file.  The bug fix is in the cvsupd server, so
  mirror sites  must upgrade their servers in order for this fix to
  help.  Meanwhile, adding "ports/Attic/INDEX*" to the refuse file
  serves as a work-around.

  The gstreamer-plugins gconf dependency moved to its own port in devel.
  When your application needs gstreamer-plug-gconf, just add
  USE_GSTREAMER=gconf to you Makefile

  New GNOME components have been added to bsd.gnome.mk.  See
  http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/gnome2_porting.html for the complete
  list of available GNOME 2 components.

  Py-gnome2 lost many of its GNOME dependencies to a new port,
  py-gnome-extras.  Therefore, ports that used to depend on
  the pygnome2 component for modules such as gtkhtml2, gnomepanel, etc.
  should replace the pygnome2 dependency with pygnomeextras.

  New variable for in /etc/make.conf: IGNORE_MASTER_SITE_xxx

  If you prefer a certain mastersite for a collection of master-sites,
  set this in your /etc/make.conf:

	MASTER_SITE_xxx=http://z.x.y/%SUBDIR%/

  If you insist on only using the ones you specify, set this in
  your /etc/make.conf:

	IGNORE_MASTER_SITE_xxx=yes
	MASTER_SITE_xxx=http://z.x.y/%SUBDIR%/

  Use "make -V MASTER_SITES" to see the differences.

  The following changes were committed:

 * USE_GNOME=gstreamerplugins has been deprecated.
     The new method which uses bsd.gstreamer.mk is:
       USE_GSTREAMER=plugin-name

    Example:
     USE_GSTREAMER= dvd

     or

     WANT_GSTREAMER= yes
     .include <bsd.port.pre.mk>
     .if defined(WITH_DVD)
     USE_GSTREAMER= dvd
     .endif

  * misc/gnomehier now creates a mtree file and each port
    using USE_GNOME=gnomehier or gnomeprefix now use the
    BSD.gnome-x11.dist mtree file to help "keep" directories
    and not accidentally add gnome directories to a port.

  The following changes were committed:

  * Change bento to pointyhat names in comments.

  * Document DISABLE_VULNERABILITIES variable.

  * Add WWW: line for 'search' target.

  * Speedup check-vulnerable invocation, if portaudit is installed.

  * Run install-info for all .info files.

  * Run add-plist-docs more strictly and prevent some situations
    with leftover files in the future.

  * Introduce two new variables: MASTER_PORT and SLAVE_PORT.
    The results from these variables is only used as information for
    users.

  * Honor OPTIONS if PACKAGE_BUILDING or BATCH are defined.

  * Move all USE_GCC entries to new file - bsd.gcc.mk.  'test-gcc'
    target allows users to check gcc version if USE_GCC is used.
    Give maintainers opportunity to add '+' character to USE_GCC version
    for using specified and higher versions.

    Example:

    USE_GCC=3.3+

    builds ports with gcc version 3.3 and higher (3.4, 4.0).

  * Install startup scripts with the help of USE_RC_SUBR variable.

  * Add three new targets: config-recursive, rmconfig-recursive and
    config-conditional.  You can set or delete OPTIONS for all
    dependencies before every build.  config-conditional target is
    used to skip configuring ports which have already been
    configured.

  * Fix using of WANT_PGSQL_VER variable if PostgreSQL is already
    installed.

  The following changes were committed:

  * Define new macros: DATE, FMT, MKTEMP, OBJDUMP, and use
    command macro SORT.

  * Change layout of comments to 4 column tabs, remove lots
    of spaces and eight-column-tabs.

  * Introduce 2 new variables: SUB_FILES and SUB_LIST:

    Example:

    SUB_FILES=	pkg-message pkg-install
    SUB_LIST+=	"VERSION=${VERSION}"

    This looks for ${FILESDIR}/pkg-message.in and ${FILESDIR}/pkg-install.in
    Substitutions in SUB_LIST are applied to these files and the
    output is redirected to ${WRKDIR}.

    PKGMESSAGE will be set to ${WRKDIR}/pkg-message.
    PKGINSTALL will be set to ${WRKDIR}/pkg-install.

  * Document DEPRECATED and EXPIRATION_DATE variables.

  * Sanitize the intermittent output by the build infrastructure
    so that cutting and pasting from it no longer interferes
    with GNATS-tags.

  * Honor configure arguments for USE_XLIB if USE/WITH_LIBTOOL_ is
    used.

  * Properly document 'describe' target.

  * Properly remove directories at deinstallation time if ports sets
    a non-standard PREFIX.

  * Defaults INDEXFILE to INDEX-6 on 6-CURRENT.

20041119:

  The following changes were committed:

  * Fix INDEX build if MAINTAINER is not defined.

  * Remove USE_QT2 option, since qt2 is obsolete.

  * Better define and explain ARCH option.

  * Add new script Tools/make_readmes, to speedup 'readmes'
    target. Avoid recursing into individual port directories and run
    it at top level, after the category README.html files have been
    created.

  * Fix 'search' target and enable a case-insensitive search on 5-x.

  * Extend 'search' target and enable search by categories.

  * Remove 'tk42' and 'tcl76' categories since they're obsolete.

  * Introduce DISTVERSION variable, that can be set instead of
    PORTVERSION and is automatically converted in a conforming PORTVERSION.

    Example:

    DISTVERSION=	10Alpha3

    extends 10Alpha3 to 10.a3

    DISTVERSION=	3Beta7-pre2

    extends 3Beta7-pre2 to 3.b7.p2

  * Use --suffix option instead of -b for patch(1), to make it
    compatible with BSD patch(1).

  * Fix {WANT,WITH}_MYSQL_VER behavior, to deal with conflicting
    versions.

  The XFREE86_VERSION variable is replaced by the X_WINDOW_SYSTEM variable.
  XFREE86_VERSION may no longer be used by ports Makefiles.  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM may
  currently be set to xorg, xfree86-4, and xfree86-3 (please use :L in checking
  it).  Several X_*_PORT variables are provided by bsd.port.mk which map to the
  appropriate port for the X_WINDOW_SYSTEM chosen.

  There has been a big update to PHP ports and bsd.php.mk to add more
  flexibility and new features.
  Now a port may depend on a specific set of PHP extensions.  To do so,
  simply replace:

  USE_PHP=	yes

  with:

  USE_PHP=	ext1 ext2 ext3 ...

  in the port Makefile. A list of all PHP extensions is included in bsd.php.mk.
  If the requirement is a build dependency too, the port should also define:

  USE_PHP_BUILD=yes

  Moreover, the new knob WANT_PHP_SCR has been added to indicate that the port
  requires the 'php' binary to run.
  Last but not least, many common operations to build/install/register a
  PHP extension can now be omitted from the port Makefile if it defines:

  USE_PHPEXT=	yes

  For more information on this point and on additional variables, see
  bsd.php.mk.

20040717:
AUTHOR: eik@FreeBSD.org
  OpenLDAP version 2.2 is now the default.
  When your port links against the openldap client libraries use
    USE_OPENLDAP=	yes
  and do not depend on a particular version. A user (or package
  building cluster) can select the desired flavor with
  WANT_OPENLDAP_VER and WANT_OPENLDAP_SASL, but these must not
  be used in ports Makefiles.

20040709:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
  USE_LIBTOOL_VER now configures a port to use the ports version of libtool
  instead of its included version.  This was put in place to reduce the
  number of ad hoc patches to individual ports' libtools to prevent .la
  file installation as well as fix various threading problems.

  To restore the previous libtool behavior, use the new macro,
  USE_INC_LIBTOOL_VER.  It works the exact same way as USE_LIBTOOL_VER
  in that it takes a libtool version as its argument.

  For example, to use the included version of libtool with extra hacks
  provided by libtool-1.5, add the following to your Makefile:

  USE_INC_LIBTOOL_VER=	15

  To use the ports version of libtool-1.5, add the following to
  your Makefile:

  USE_LIBTOOL_VER=	15

  Note: these macros are mutually exclusive.  Your port should only include
  one or the other if it needs to make use of libtool.

  The way GConf schema files are installed has changed to support the upcoming
  GNOME 2.8 GConf.  Details about the change can be found at
  http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/porting.html.  All existing ports have
  been converted to the new style, and portlint has been updated to flag
  old-style GConf schema installation.

  The following behavioral or feature changes were committed:

  * Support verbose index builds with INDEX_VERBOSE

  * Support glob expressions in USE_GETTEXT to allow more flexibility
    in the face of future gratuitous library version bumps by the gettext
    developers:

    USE_GETTEXT=yEs   # Works as before (case-insensitive)
    USE_GETTEXT=[5-7] # Accepts any of those libintl.so.x versions
                      # in the LIB_DEPENDS

  * Extend 'make search' support to allow much more flexible searching
    From the PR:

    Besides the good old key and name variables, this patch adds
    support for path, info, maint, cat, bdeps, and rdeps, which match
    on the appropriate fields, plus their exclusion counterparts: xkey,
    xname, etc.

    Examples:

    Find all ports whose names contain "pear-" but not "html" or "http":

      make search name=pear- xname='ht(tp|ml)'

    Find ports whose names contain "pear-" and which don't have apache
    listed in build-time dependencies:

      make search name=pear- xbdeps=apache

    The positive variables (name, key, maint, etc) are AND-ed, their
    negative versions are OR-ed; in other words, matching any x-
    variable will cause the port to be skipped, mismatch on any non-x-
    variable will cause it to be skipped.

    Examples:

    Find ports that are both in the 'www' category and maintained by
    Thierry Thomas:

      make search maint=thierry@ path=/www/

    Find ports in the 'archivers' category that are either not orphaned
    or don't have "zip" in their names (contrived):

      make search cat=archivers xmaint=ports@freebsd xname=zip

    It is possible to select fields to display.

    Example:

    Find PEAR ports that don't build-depend on apache, displaying only
    Port:, Path:, and Info: lines:

      make search name=pear- xbdeps=apache display=name,path,info

    Case-sensitivity can now be turned of with icase=1.

    Example:

    Find ports with @freebsd.org maintainer addresses without the
    "proper" capitalization (@FreeBSD.org), display their paths and
    maintainer addresses:

      make search maint=@freebsd\\.org icase=0 display=maint,path

    The key and xkey variables can be limited in scope to displayed fields
    by setting keylim to 1.

    Example:

    Find ports that contain "apache" in either of the name, path, info
    fields, ignore the rest of the record (dependencies, maintainer
    address, etc):

      make search key=apache display=name,path,info keylim=1

    The following variables can be set e.g. in /etc/make.conf to
    control default search behavior:

      PORTSEARCH_DISPLAY_FIELDS?=name,path,info,maint,index,bdeps,rdeps
      PORTSEARCH_KEYLIM?=0
      PORTSEARCH_XKEYLIM?=0
      PORTSEARCH_IGNORECASE?=1

  * Extend USE_PERL5_BUILD and USE_PERL5 to add EXTRACT and PATCH
    dependencies

  * While building index, treat non-existent dependencies as fatal.
    Previously the error was being hidden by the stderr
    redirection.

  * Don't always retry BROKEN ports when package building (it is taking
    too much time to continually rebuild ports that are usually going
    to really be broken).  Set TRYBROKEN if you want to attempt a
    build of a BROKEN port.

AUTHOR:	ade@FreeBSD.org
	Over the past few weeks, we have been testing the next
	incarnation of ports/Mk/bsd.autotools.mk on the road to bringing
	at least some semblance of sanity back to this corner of the
	ports collection.

	By far and away the easiest way to see the changes will be to
	view the new file once committed, but here is a summary of the
	changes:

	1. USE_LIBTOOL, USE_AUTOCONF, USE_AUTOHEADER, USE_AUTOMAKE have
	been fully deprecated.  Ports attempting to use these variables
	after the commit will error out, and most obviously break INDEX
	generation, with a helpful error message.  Instead, ports must
	now specifically choose the version of any of these tools that
	they need with the corresponding USE_*_VER variables.  Note that
	these variables understand any and all versions of autotools ports
	in the tree, there is no longer a need to have specific version
	numbers hardcoded in the infrastructure of bsd.autotools.mk
	(as there is now).  In particular, this will immediately open up
	automake18 and autoconf259 for general use and beating.

	2. Similarly for WANT_LIBTOOL, WANT_AUTOCONF, and WANT_AUTOMAKE.
	Again, these have been fully deprecated, and the equivalent
	WANT_*_VER versions should be used.

	In order to preserve existing behavior for these variables, please
	note the 20040314 entry in ports/CHANGES for the appropriate
	version numbers to use for any ports in the GNATS queue.

	Both WANT_* and USE_* bring in the relevant tool as a build
	dependency, and set up a reasonably large number of variables
	pointing to the right programs to be using in the port.  The
	only difference at the moment, is that USE_* will run an extra
	autotools-related configuration step, whereas WANT_* merely
	requests the environment.

	3. The helper knob USE_LIBLTDL has been added which currently
	simply adds a LIB dependency on the libltdl port.

	4. Three new variables have been introduced,
	WANT_{LIBTOOL,AUTOCONF,AUTOMAKE}_RUN=yes.  These variables will
	do nothing by themselves (a Work-In-Progress), but if the
	appropriate autotool version is defined (either through
	WANT_*_VER or USE_*_VER), this will add the relevant dependency
	to RUN_DEPENDS.

	Steps 3 and 4 now essentially negate the need for any kind of
	direct dependency within a non-autotools port Makefile on
	devel/autoconf*, devel/automake*, devel/libtool*, and devel/libltdl.

20040416:
AUTHOR:	java@FreeBSD.org
	There has been a couple of bsd.java.mk tweaks and fixes.

	. Features from Stage 2 has been removed.  A port can no
	  longer use the JDK dependency features by setting JAVA_HOME.
	  Use JAVA_PREFERRED_PORT instead (see below).

	. The default JDK port now depends on OS version:
	  java/diablo-jdk13 for 4.x, and java/jdk14 for 5.x

	. It is now possible for the user (and the porters) to
	  define a list of preferred JDK ports to build and run ports.
	  The port will use the first JDK port from the list that
	  matches the requirements specified in the Makefile.
	  JAVA_PREFERRED_PORT contains a list of suitable JDK ports
	  (sorted by preference).  Names for JDKs may be found in
	  bsd.java.mk, listed in ${_JAVA_PORTS_ALL} (e.g.
	  "JAVA_PORT_NATIVE_BSDJAVA_1_4").

	. JAVA_PORT_VERSION is now set to the full version number
	  of the chosen JDK (e.g. "1.4.2").  Porters will find hints
	  regarding how to obtain the same behavior as before in the
	  header of bsd.java.mk.

20040414:
AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	When writing a port that uses GTK+ 2.X, you can now list the dependency
	with "USE_GNOME=gtk20" which is preferable to LIB_DEPENDS because the
	GTK+ library version only needs to be changed in bsd.gnome.mk.

	Please see http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/porting.html for all
	the available GNOME components as well as detailed instructions on
	creating ports that use the GNOME infrastructure.

20040404:
AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	The glib20 and gtk20 ports were updated to 2.4.0.  This new version
	is completely source and binary compatible with the previous 2.2.x
	series.  However, certain API calls have been deprecated.  If your
	port defines the following macros, they may refuse to build with
	the new versions of glib20 and gtk20:

GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
GDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
G_DISABLE_DEPRECATED

	The temporary solution is to either patch your port's Makefiles to,
	or use an in-place regular expression to remove these macros.  The
	more permanent solution is to wait until the port's authors update
	their code to use current API calls.

20040402:
AUTHOR:	java@FreeBSD.org
	There has been a big update to bsd.java.mk.  However, this update
	is mostly backwards compatible, so it shouldn't affect most java
	port maintainers.  There is some new functionality and minor
	changes worth documenting here though.

	bsd.java.mk now provides a new set of macros to be used by ports that
	require a JDK. When USE_JAVA is set, the following variables may be set
	in order to give to precision regarding the requirements of the port:

	. JAVA_VERSION
	  A list of space-separated suitable java versions for the
	  port. An optional "+" allows you to specify a range of versions.
	  (allowed values: 1.1[+] 1.2[+] 1.3[+] 1.4[+])
	  (NOTE: Used to be set by bsd.java.mk)
	. JAVA_OS
	  A list of space-separated suitable JDK port operating systems
	  for the port. (allowed values: native linux)
	  (NOTE: Used to be set by bsd.java.mk)
	. JAVA_VENDOR
	  A list of space-separated suitable JDK port vendors for
	  the port. (allowed values: freebsd bsdjava sun ibm blackdown)
	  (NOTE: Used to be set by bsd.java.mk)
	. JAVA_BUILD
	  When set, it means that the selected JDK port should be
	  added to build dependencies for the port.
	. JAVA_RUN
	  This variable works exactly the same as JAVA_BUILD but
	  regarding run dependencies.

	Here are some of the macros defined after setting USE_JAVA:

	. JAVA_PORT
	  The name of the JDK port (e.g. java/jdk14)
	. JAVA_HOME
	  The home of the JDK port in the local base
	. JAVA_PORT_VERSION
	  The version of the JDK port.
	  (NOTE: Used to be JAVA_VERSION, see above)
	. JAVA_PORT_OS
	  The operating system used by the JDK port.
	  (NOTE: Used to be JAVA_OS, see above)
	. JAVA_PORT_VENDOR
	  The vendor of the JDK port.
	  (NOTE: Used to be JAVA_VENDOR, see above)

	Plus many macros for the commonly used java executables:

		APPLETVIEWER, JAR, JAVA, JAVAC, JAVADOC, JAVAH,
		JAVAP, JAVA_KEYTOOL, JAVA_N2A, JAVA_POLICYTOOL,
		JAVA_SERIALVER, RMIC, RMID and RMIREGISTRY.

	bsd.java.mk 2.0 is mostly backward compatible with the previous
	version, save for the notes above and changed internal variables.
	Using the new features is strongly encouraged, since the old
	bsd.java.mk 1.0 features will be deprecated and may be removed in
	the future.

AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	The print/freetype2 port has been updated to 2.1.7.  This update
	changes some of the internal FreeType API.  Applications may need
	to be patched to support this new API.  If a source files includes
	freetype/freetype.h, make sure ft2build.h is included before
	freetype/freetype.h.  The proper way to do this is:

#include <ft2build.h>
#include FT_FREETYPE_H

	However, the following will work as well, but is deprecated:

#include <ft2build.h>
#include <freetype/freetype.h>

	USE_LIBTOOL, USE_AUTOCONF, and USE_AUTOMAKE are now considered
	deprecated, and will be removed on or around June 1st 2004.
	All ports should now choose the specific version of the tool,
	using USE_LIBTOOL_VER, USE_AUTOCONF_VER, and USE_AUTOMAKE_VER.
	The old "system default" behavior can be written as follows:

	Old			New
	USE_LIBTOOL=yes		USE_LIBTOOL_VER=13
	USE_AUTOCONF=yes	USE_AUTOCONF_VER=213
	USE_AUTOMAKE=yes	USE_AUTOMAKE_VER=14

	New variable MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE_EXTENDED. It has the
	ten official sourceforge.net download mirrors, whereas
	MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE only has five. To check if your
	port is mirrored there, go to
	<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/${MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR}/>
	click on ${DISTFILES} and you'll see five or ten mirrors,
	corresponding to the variables above.

	The default version of Ruby is now 1.8 on all platforms
	including the i386.

	Users on the i386 platform need to follow the instructions
	described in the UPDATING file to cope with this upgrade.

	Next time ruby is major upgraded, you won't need to do this
	kind of messy work because some subtle changes have been made
	to the ruby port infrastructure to make it easier to handle
	multiple versions of ruby.

AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	Mozilla will now default to using GTK2, and will only compile
	against Gtk+-1.2 if explicitly requested.  This is in exact
	opposite to the old behavior.

	The valid values of WITH_MOZILLA are now:
		mozilla			(www/mozilla, GTK2)
		mozilla-devel		(www/mozilla-devel, GTK2)
		mozilla-gtk1		(www/mozilla-gtk1, GTK1)
		mozilla-devel-gtk1	(www/mozilla-devel-gtk1, GTK1)

	As before, WITH_MOZILLA can be set in /etc/make.conf, but doing
	so is not advised unless you desire the development versions.
	GTK2 browsers will automatically compile against GTK2 mozilla,
	and GTK1 browsers (galeon1, galeon1, and galeon1) will
	automatically compile against GTK1.

	Again, the only people who will need to take action are those
	who desire development versions (which are inactive at this time
	anyway).  Those who want GTK1 mozilla-devel must set
	WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-devel-gtk1 or they will be pleasantly
	surprised with their very own GTK2 installation on the next
	update.

	WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-gtk2 and WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-devel-gtk2
	are still honored for the time being, but their use is
	now deprecated.  Any new ports are not required to consider
	their values, and so eventually WITH_MOZILLA _will_ have to
	be changed.

	Hopefully galeon2 can catch up to peoples' expectations from
	galeon1 soon, and we can remove the GTK1 ports altogether.


20040204:
AUTHOR:	portmgr@FreeBSD.org
	The bsd.php.mk file has been moved out of the lang/php4 port
	into the Mk directory.  This will make it much easier to include
	PHP support in PHP-dependent ports.  Instead of including
	bsd.php.mk directly, a port can simply set USE_PHP=yes, and the
	ports system with Do the Right Thing.

	All trailing whitespace has been removed from bsd.port.mk.

	Enhance the new OPTIONS code by only including saved options if
	the port defines OPTIONS, attempt to use LATEST_LINK as the
	unique name for a port (fall back to ${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME}
	otherwise), bring the ===> messages in line with the existing
	ones by using PKGNAME instead of PORTNAME, use PKGNAME in the
	dialog, use ECHO_CMD instead of ECHO_MSG to write the
	OPTIONSFILE, display a message during compilation indicating
	that user-specified options have been found, and make the output
	of the showconfig target a little more user-friendly.

	A new USE_ICONV macro has been added that takes the place of an
	explicit LIB_DEPENDS on converters/libiconv.  This will help
	with future shared lib version bumps.

	A new USE_GETTEXT macro has been added that takes the place of
	an explicit LIB_DEPENDS on devel/gettext.  This will help with
	future shared lib version bumps.

	Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing
	Perl modules.  It will eventually replace the obsoleted
	ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Many new Perl modules have already
	switched to using Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL.  To
	facilitate building those modules, a new PERL_MODBUILD macro has
	been added.  Use that in place of PERL_CONFIGURE when porting
	Perl modules that make use of the Module::Build framework.

	Certain ports want to check for the availability of SDL
	libraries before including them.  This change adds a new
	WANT_SDL macro similar to WANT_GNOME.  By setting this, the
	porter indicates that her port can optional use SDL if present
	on the system.  WANT_SDL should be defined _before_
	bsd.port.pre.mk is included.  After including bsd.port.pre.mk,
	the list of available SDL components will be returned in the
	HAVE_SDL macro.  For details on how to process this component
	list, refer to bsd.sdl.mk.

	The OpenBSD and NetBSD projects diverged from the FreeBSD ports
	tree years ago, and it no longer make sense to include obsolete
	references to incorrect paths in the FreeBSD ports system.  This
	change removes the NetBSD and OpenBSD PORTSDIR compatibility
	bits from bsd.port.mk.

	The comment for PKGDIR read, ``A direction containing any
	package creating file.''  The word ``direction'' should be
	``directory.''  This has been fixed.

	A new DIRNAME macro has been added that points to
	/usr/bin/dirname.  All direct use of dirname in ports can be
	switched to this macro.

	Direct use of commands dirname, id, and rm have been corrected
	to use their macro equivalents instead.  Some useless ${HEAD}
	-n 1 statements have been removed.  A strange comment in the
	do-install target and an out of place ``fi'' have been fixed as
	well.

	On 5-CURRENT after the 5.2-RELEASE split, the default Perl
	version has been updated from 5.6.1 to 5.8.2.  As well, some
	Perl definitions in bsd.port.mk have been moved to their correct
	locations which corrects the PERL_LEVEL definition.

	The following optimizations have been added to the ports system
	to speed up recursive operations such as make describe, make
	index, make ignorelist, etc.  bsd.gnome.mk is now only included
	if a port defines USE_GNOME, WANT_GNOME, and/or USE_GTK.  More
	variables are cached and passed down through bsd.port.subdir.mk.
	Perl is no longer invoked when a simple ``echo'' will do.  More
	subshell variable assignments have been hidden behind
	conditionals so that the commands are not spawned every time.
	Finally, dependency lists are only constructed if ports actually
	declare dependencies.  These optimizations give make index
	approximately a 43% speedup.

	If CPUFLAGS is not defined (this _CPUCFLAGS is empty), trying
	to remove _CPUCFLAGS from CFLAGS will result in an error.  This
	change fixes that.

	On recent versions of 5.X, /etc/rc.subr exists, and there is no
	reason to install another copy in ${LOCALBASE}/etc.  The reason
	this was ever done was to workaround some build issues on bento.
	However, testing OSVERSION seems to work in spite of those build
	issues.

	The ports system now supports MySQL 3.23, 4.0, 4.1, and 5.0.
	Also, the ability to scale to newer versions was also but in
	place.

	An .endif comment indicated that the .if block checked
	WANT_MYSQL when, in fact, it was checking WANT_MYSQL_VER.  This
	has been corrected.

	The PTHREAD{CFLAGS,LIBS} macros have been made overridable on
	all versions of FreeBSD to allow for alternate threading
	implementations (e.g. -lc_r, -lthr, -mt, etc.).  The default
	threading library has been changed to -lpthread from -lc_r on
	-CURRENT.

	The new SIZE support broke distfiles fetching on FreeBSD < 4.8.
	On those versions of FreeBSD, the SIZE distfile attribute is now
	ignored.  Also, defining DISABLE_SIZE in, for example,
	/etc/make.conf, will ignore the SIZE attribute on all versions
	of FreeBSD.  This is useful with alternate values for FETCH_CMD.

	A new vulnerabilities database has been added to the ports
	system in order to keep more accurate, up-to-date, track of
	security vulnerabilities.  The ports system now knows how to
	query that database and dynamically prevents the installation
	of vulnerable ports.

	In order to allow for more rapid development of the package
	tools, the ports system will prefer to use pkg_* tools found in
	${LOCALBASE} over those in the base system.  However, all PKG_*
	macros are still overridable.

	A new physical category, net-mgmt, has been created to house
	network management ports.

	The /var/db/port.mkversion file never really took off, and is
	now very obsolete.  Replace the code used to generate and check
	this file with a simple OSVERSION check.  The ports system now
	requires FreeBSD 4.3 or higher.

	The last round of bsd.*.mk changes broke ports that had
	duplicate distinfo entries (e.g. linux_base).  This is now
	fixed.  Along with this fix, only distfiles with a bad checksum
	will be refetched, where as distfiles missing from distinfo will
	not be refetched.

	The PLIST_{DIRS,FILES} macros were passed to the final package
	list unchanged by PLIST_SUB.  This is not always desirable.
	Now, those macros are passed through PLIST_SUB.

	The previous OPTIONS code assumed users would be running port
	build as root.  If this was not the case, OPTIONS configuration
	would fail.  Now, the bits of the config and rmconfig targets
	that require write access to system directories are run under
	SU_CMD.

	The makesum target will now add a SIZE attribute for each
	distfile by default.  This can be overridden by defining NO_SIZE
	in a port's Makefile.  Note: this could probably be expanded to
	omit SIZE attributes for specific distfiles in the future.

20040129:
AUTHOR:	trevor@FreeBSD.org
	SIZE lines in distinfo files:  if you set USE_SIZE when you do "make
	makesum", the byte sizes of the distfiles will be listed in the
	distinfo file. Then, if a distfile is replaced on its master site with
	one of a different size than that listed, "make fetch" will fail with a
	"size mismatch" error before downloading the file and the user will be
	asked to fetch the file by hand. Also, a user will know the size of
	the distfiles before fetching and decide to fetch later.
