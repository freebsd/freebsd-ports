20040129:
        SIZE lines in distinfo files:  if you set USE_SIZE when you do "make
	makesum", the byte sizes of the distfiles will be listed in the
	distinfo file. Then, if a distfile is replaced on its master site with
	one of a different size than that listed, "make fetch" will fail with a
	"size mismatch" error before downloading the file and the user will be
	asked to fetch the file by hand. Also, a user will know the size of
	the distfiles before fetching and decide to fetch later.
