  The XFREE86_VERSION variable is replaced by the X_WINDOW_SYSTEM variable.
  XFREE86_VERSION may no longer be used by ports Makefiles.  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM may
  currently be set to xorg, xfree86-4, and xfree86-3 (please use :L in checking
  it).  Several X_*_PORT variables are provided by bsd.port.mk which map to the
  appropriate port for the X_WINDOW_SYSTEM chosen.

  There has been a big update to PHP ports and bsd.php.mk to add more
  flexibility and new features.
  Now a port may depend on a specific set of PHP extensions.  To do so,
  simply replace:

  USE_PHP=	yes

  with:

  USE_PHP=	ext1 ext2 ext3 ...

  in the port Makefile. A list of all PHP extensions is included in bsd.php.mk.
  If the requirement is a build dependency too, the port should also define:

  USE_PHP_BUILD=yes

  Moreover, the new knob WANT_PHP_SCR has been added to indicate that the port
  requires the 'php' binary to run.
  Last but not least, many common operations to build/install/register a
  PHP extension can now be omitted from the port Makefile if it defines:

  USE_PHPEXT=	yes

  For more information on this point and on additional variables, see
  bsd.php.mk.

AUTHOR: eik@FreeBSD.org
  OpenLDAP version 2.2 is now the default.
  When your port links against the openldap client libraries use
    USE_OPENLDAP=	yes
  and do not depend on a particular version. A user (or package
  building cluster) can select the desired flavour with
  WANT_OPENLDAP_VER and WANT_OPENLDAP_SASL, but these must not
  be used in ports Makefiles.

20040709:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
  USE_LIBTOOL_VER now configures a port to use the ports version of libtool
  instead of its included version.  This was put in place to reduce the
  number of ad hoc patches to individual ports' libtools to prevent .la
  file installation as well as fix various threading problems.

  To restore the previous libtool behavior, use the new macro,
  USE_INC_LIBTOOL_VER.  It works the exact same way as USE_LIBTOOL_VER
  in that it takes a libtool version as its argument.

  For example, to use the included version of libtool with extra hacks
  provided by libtool-1.5, add the following to your Makefile:

  USE_INC_LIBTOOL_VER=	15

  To use the ports version of libtool-1.5, add the following to
  your Makefile:

  USE_LIBTOOL_VER=	15

  Note: these macros are mutually exclusive.  Your port should only include
  one or the other if it needs to make use of libtool.

  The way GConf schema files are installed has changed to support the upcoming
  GNOME 2.8 GConf.  Details about the change can be found at
  http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/porting.html.  All existing ports have
  been converted to the new style, and portlint has been updated to flag
  old-style GConf schema installation.

AUTHOR:	portmgr@FreeBSD.org
  The following behavioural or feature changes were committed:

  * Support verbose index builds with INDEX_VERBOSE

  * Support glob expressions in USE_GETTEXT to allow more flexibility
    in the face of future gratuitous library version bumps by the gettext
    developers:

    USE_GETTEXT=yEs   # Works as before (case-insensitive)
    USE_GETTEXT=[5-7] # Accepts any of those libintl.so.x versions
                      # in the LIB_DEPENDS

  * Extend 'make search' support to allow much more flexible searching
    From the PR:

    Besides the good old key and name variables, this patch adds
    support for path, info, maint, cat, bdeps, and rdeps, which match
    on the appropriate fields, plus their exclusion counterparts: xkey,
    xname, etc.

    Examples:

    Find all ports whose names contain "pear-" but not "html" or "http":

      make search name=pear- xname='ht(tp|ml)'

    Find ports whose names contain "pear-" and which don't have apache
    listed in build-time dependencies:

      make search name=pear- xbdeps=apache

    The positive variables (name, key, maint, etc) are AND-ed, their
    negative versions are OR-ed; in other words, matching any x-
    variable will cause the port to be skipped, mismatch on any non-x-
    variable will cause it to be skipped.

    Examples:

    Find ports that are both in the www category and maintained by
    Thierry Thomas:

      make search maint=thierry@ path=/www/

    Find ports in the archivers category that are either not orphaned
    or don't have "zip" in their names (contrived):

      make search cat=archivers xmaint=ports@freebsd xname=zip

    It is possible to select fields to display.

    Example:

    Find PEAR ports that don't build-depend on apache, displaying only
    Port:, Path:, and Info: lines:

      make search name=pear- xbdeps=apache display=name,path,info

    Case-sensitivity can now be turned of with icase=1.

    Example:

    Find ports with @freebsd.org maintainer addresses without the
    "proper" capitalization (@FreeBSD.org), display their paths and
    maintainer addresses:

      make search maint=@freebsd\\.org icase=0 display=maint,path

    The key and xkey variables can be limited in scope to displayed fields
    by setting keylim to 1.

    Example:

    Find ports that contain "apache" in either of the name, path, info
    fields, ignore the rest of the record (dependencies, maintainer
    address, etc):

      make search key=apache display=name,path,info keylim=1

    The following variables can be set e.g. in /etc/make.conf to
    control default search behaviour:

      PORTSEARCH_DISPLAY_FIELDS?=name,path,info,maint,index,bdeps,rdeps
      PORTSEARCH_KEYLIM?=0
      PORTSEARCH_XKEYLIM?=0
      PORTSEARCH_IGNORECASE?=1

  * Extend USE_PERL5_BUILD and USE_PERL5 to add EXTRACT and PATCH
    dependencies

  * While building index, treat non-existent dependencies as fatal.
    Previously the error was being hidden by the stderr
    redirection.

  * Don't always retry BROKEN ports when package building (it is taking
    too much time to continually rebuild ports that are usually going
    to really be broken).  Set TRYBROKEN if you want to attempt a
    build of a BROKEN port.

20040604:
AUTHOR:	ade@FreeBSD.org
	Over the past few weeks, we have been testing the next
	incarnation of ports/Mk/bsd.autotools.mk on the road to bringing
	at least some semblance of sanity back to this corner of the
	ports collection.

	By far and away the easiest way to see the changes will be to
	view the new file once committed, but here is a summary of the
	changes:

	1. USE_LIBTOOL, USE_AUTOCONF, USE_AUTOHEADER, USE_AUTOMAKE have
	been fully deprecated.  Ports attempting to use these variables
	after the commit will error out, and most obviously break INDEX
	generation, with a helpful error message.  Instead, ports must
	now specifically choose the version of any of these tools that
	they need with the corresponding USE_*_VER variables.  Note that
	these variables understand any and all versions of autotools ports
	in the tree, there is no longer a need to have specific version
	numbers hardcoded in the infrastructure of bsd.autotools.mk
	(as there is now).  In particular, this will immediately open up
	automake18 and autoconf259 for general use and beating.

	2. Similarly for WANT_LIBTOOL, WANT_AUTOCONF, and WANT_AUTOMAKE.
	Again, these have been fully deprecated, and the equivalent
	WANT_*_VER versions should be used.

	In order to preserve existing behavior for these variables, please
	note the 20040314 entry in ports/CHANGES for the appropriate
	version numbers to use for any ports in the GNATS queue.

	Both WANT_* and USE_* bring in the relevant tool as a build
	dependency, and set up a reasonably large number of variables
	pointing to the right programs to be using in the port.  The
	only difference at the moment, is that USE_* will run an extra
	autotools-related configuration step, whereas WANT_* merely
	requests the environment.

	3. The helper knob USE_LIBLTDL has been added which currently
	simply adds a LIB dependency on the libltdl port.

	4. Three new variables have been introduced,
	WANT_{LIBTOOL,AUTOCONF,AUTOMAKE}_RUN=yes.  These variables will
	do nothing by themselves (a Work-In-Progress), but if the
	appropriate autotool version is defined (either through
	WANT_*_VER or USE_*_VER), this will add the relevant dependency
	to RUN_DEPENDS.

	Steps 3 and 4 now essentially negate the need for any kind of
	direct dependency within a non-autotools port Makefile on
	devel/autoconf*, devel/automake*, devel/libtool*, and devel/libltdl.

20040416:
AUTHOR:	java@FreeBSD.org
	There has been a couple of bsd.java.mk tweaks and fixes.

	. Features from Stage 2 has been removed.  A port can no
	  longer use the JDK dependency features by setting JAVA_HOME.
	  Use JAVA_PREFERRED_PORT instead (see below).

	. The default JDK port now depends on OS version:
	  java/diablo-jdk13 for 4.x, and java/jdk14 for 5.x

	. It is now possible for the user (and the porters) to
	  define a list of preferred JDK ports to build and run ports.
	  The port will use the first JDK port from the list that
	  matches the requirements specified in the Makefile.
	  JAVA_PREFERRED_PORT contains a list of suitable JDK ports
	  (sorted by preference).  Names for JDKs may be found in
	  bsd.java.mk, listed in ${_JAVA_PORTS_ALL} (e.g.
	  "JAVA_PORT_NATIVE_BSDJAVA_1_4").

	. JAVA_PORT_VERSION is now set to the full version number
	  of the chosen JDK (e.g. "1.4.2").  Porters will find hints
	  regarding how to obtain the same behavior as before in the
	  header of bsd.java.mk.

20040414:
AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	When writing a port that uses GTK+ 2.X, you can now list the dependency
	with "USE_GNOME=gtk20" which is preferable to LIB_DEPENDS because the
	GTK+ library version only needs to be changed in bsd.gnome.mk.

	Please see http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/porting.html for all
	the available GNOME components as well as detailed instructions on
	creating ports that use the GNOME infrastructure.

20040404:
AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	The glib20 and gtk20 ports were updated to 2.4.0.  This new version
	is completely source and binary compatible with the previous 2.2.x
	series.  However, certain API calls have been deprecated.  If your
	port defines the following macros, they may refuse to build with
	the new versions of glib20 and gtk20:

GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
GDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
G_DISABLE_DEPRECATED

	The temporary solution is to either patch your port's Makefiles to,
	or use an in-place regular expression to remove these macros.  The
	more permanent solution is to wait until the port's authors update
	their code to use current API calls.

20040402:
AUTHOR:	java@FreeBSD.org
	There has been a big update to bsd.java.mk.  However, this update
	is mostly backwards compatible, so it shouldn't affect most java
	port maintainers.  There is some new functionality and minor
	changes worth documenting here though.

	bsd.java.mk now provides a new set of macros to be used by ports that
	require a JDK. When USE_JAVA is set, the following variables may be set
	in order to give to precision regarding the requirements of the port:

	. JAVA_VERSION
	  A list of space-separated suitable java versions for the
	  port. An optional "+" allows you to specify a range of versions.
	  (allowed values: 1.1[+] 1.2[+] 1.3[+] 1.4[+])
	  (NOTE: Used to be set by bsd.java.mk)
	. JAVA_OS
	  A list of space-separated suitable JDK port operating systems
	  for the port. (allowed values: native linux)
	  (NOTE: Used to be set by bsd.java.mk)
	. JAVA_VENDOR
	  A list of space-separated suitable JDK port vendors for
	  the port. (allowed values: freebsd bsdjava sun ibm blackdown)
	  (NOTE: Used to be set by bsd.java.mk)
	. JAVA_BUILD
	  When set, it means that the selected JDK port should be
	  added to build dependencies for the port.
	. JAVA_RUN
	  This variable works exactly the same as JAVA_BUILD but
	  regarding run dependencies.

	Here are some of the macros defined after setting USE_JAVA:

	. JAVA_PORT
	  The name of the JDK port (e.g. java/jdk14)
	. JAVA_HOME
	  The home of the JDK port in the local base
	. JAVA_PORT_VERSION
	  The version of the JDK port.
	  (NOTE: Used to be JAVA_VERSION, see above)
	. JAVA_PORT_OS
	  The operating system used by the JDK port.
	  (NOTE: Used to be JAVA_OS, see above)
	. JAVA_PORT_VENDOR
	  The vendor of the JDK port.
	  (NOTE: Used to be JAVA_VENDOR, see above)

	Plus many macros for the commonly used java executables:

		APPLETVIEWER, JAR, JAVA, JAVAC, JAVADOC, JAVAH,
		JAVAP, JAVA_KEYTOOL, JAVA_N2A, JAVA_POLICYTOOL,
		JAVA_SERIALVER, RMIC, RMID and RMIREGISTRY.

	bsd.java.mk 2.0 is mostly backward compatible with the previous
	version, save for the notes above and changed internal variables.
	Using the new features is strongly encouraged, since the old
	bsd.java.mk 1.0 features will be deprecated and may be removed in
	the future.

	You will find more detailed info (as well as a quick tutorial) at:
	http://www.esil.univ-mrs.fr/~hquiroz/freebsd/bsd.java.mk-2.0.html

20040316:
AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	The print/freetype2 port has been updated to 2.1.7.  This update
	changes some of the internal FreeType API.  Applications may need
	to be patched to support this new API.  If a source files includes
	freetype/freetype.h, make sure ft2build.h is included before
	freetype/freetype.h.  The proper way to do this is:

#include <ft2build.h>
#include FT_FREETYPE_H

	However, the following will work as well, but is deprecated:

#include <ft2build.h>
#include <freetype/freetype.h>

20040314:
AUTHOR:	ade@FreeBSD.org
	USE_LIBTOOL, USE_AUTOCONF, and USE_AUTOMAKE are now considered
	deprecated, and will be removed on or around June 1st 2004.
	All ports should now choose the specific version of the tool,
	using USE_LIBTOOL_VER, USE_AUTOCONF_VER, and USE_AUTOMAKE_VER.
	The old "system default" behavior can be written as follows:

	Old			New
	USE_LIBTOOL=yes		USE_LIBTOOL_VER=13
	USE_AUTOCONF=yes	USE_AUTOCONF_VER=213
	USE_AUTOMAKE=yes	USE_AUTOMAKE_VER=14

20040304:
AUTHOR:	eik@FreeBSD.org
	New variable MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE_EXTENDED. It has the
	ten official sourceforge.net download mirrors, whereas
	MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE only has five. To check if your
	port is mirrored there, go to
	<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/${MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR}/>
	click on ${DISTFILES} and you'll see five or ten mirrors,
	corresponding to the variables above.

20040226:
AUTHOR:	knu@FreeBSD.org
	The default version of Ruby is now 1.8 on all platforms
	including the i386.

	Users on the i386 platform need to follow the instructions
	described in the UPDATING file to cope with this upgrade.

	Next time ruby is major upgraded, you won't need to do this
	kind of messy work because some subtle changes have been made
	to the ruby port infrastructure to make it easier to handle
	multiple versions of ruby.

20040217:
AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	Mozilla will now default to using GTK2, and will only compile
	against Gtk+-1.2 if explicitly requested.  This is in exact
	opposite to the old behaviour.

	The valid values of WITH_MOZILLA are now:
		mozilla			(www/mozilla, GTK2)
		mozilla-devel		(www/mozilla-devel, GTK2)
		mozilla-gtk1		(www/mozilla-gtk1, GTK1)
		mozilla-devel-gtk1	(www/mozilla-devel-gtk1, GTK1)

	As before, WITH_MOZILLA can be set in /etc/make.conf, but doing
	so is not advised unless you desire the development versions.
	GTK2 browsers will automatically compile against GTK2 mozilla,
	and GTK1 browsers (galeon1, galeon1, and galeon1) will
	automatically compile against GTK1.

	Again, the only people who will need to take action are those
	who desire development versions (which are inactive at this time
	anyway).  Those who want GTK1 mozilla-devel must set
	WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-devel-gtk1 or they will be pleasantly
	surprised with their very own GTK2 installation on the next
	update.

	WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-gtk2 and WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-devel-gtk2
	are still honoured for the time being, but their use is
	now deprecated.  Any new ports are not required to consider
	their values, and so eventually WITH_MOZILLA _will_ have to
	be changed.

	Hopefully galeon2 can catch up to peoples' expectations from
	galeon1 soon, and we can remove the GTK1 ports altogether.


20040204:
AUTHOR:	portmgr@FreeBSD.org
	The bsd.php.mk file has been moved out of the lang/php4 port
	into the Mk directory.  This will make it much easier to include
	PHP support in PHP-dependent ports.  Instead of including
	bsd.php.mk directly, a port can simply set USE_PHP=yes, and the
	ports system with Do the Right Thing.

	All trailing whitespace has been removed from bsd.port.mk.

	Enhance the new OPTIONS code by only including saved options if
	the port defines OPTIONS, attempt to use LATEST_LINK as the
	unique name for a port (fall back to ${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME}
	otherwise), bring the ===> messages in line with the existing
	ones by using PKGNAME instead of PORTNAME, use PKGNAME in the
	dialog, use ECHO_CMD instead of ECHO_MSG to write the
	OPTIONSFILE, display a message during compilation indicating
	that user-specified options have been found, and make the output
	of the showconfig target a little more user-friendly.

	A new USE_ICONV macro has been added that takes the place of an
	explicit LIB_DEPENDS on converters/libiconv.  This will help
	with future shared lib version bumps.

	A new USE_GETTEXT macro has been added that takes the place of
	an explicit LIB_DEPENDS on devel/gettext.  This will help with
	future shared lib version bumps.

	Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing
	Perl modules.  It will eventually replace the obsoleted
	ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Many new Perl modules have already
	switched to using Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL.  To
	facilitate building those modules, a new PERL_MODBUILD macro has
	been added.  Use that in place of PERL_CONFIGURE when porting
	Perl modules that make use of the Module::Build framework.

	Certain ports want to check for the availability of SDL
	libraries before including them.  This change adds a new
	WANT_SDL macro similar to WANT_GNOME.  By setting this, the
	porter indicates that her port can optional use SDL if present
	on the system.  WANT_SDL should be defined _before_
	bsd.port.pre.mk is included.  After including bsd.port.pre.mk,
	the list of available SDL components will be returned in the
	HAVE_SDL macro.  For details on how to process this component
	list, refer to bsd.sdl.mk.

	The OpenBSD and NetBSD projects diverged from the FreeBSD ports
	tree years ago, and it no longer make sense to include obsolete
	references to incorrect paths in the FreeBSD ports system.  This
	change removes the NetBSD and OpenBSD PORTSDIR compatibility
	bits from bsd.port.mk.

	The comment for PKGDIR read, ``A direction containing any
	package creating file.''  The word ``direction'' should be
	``directory.''  This has been fixed.

	A new DIRNAME macro has been added that points to
	/usr/bin/dirname.  All direct use of dirname in ports can be
	switched to this macro.

	Direct use of commands dirname, id, and rm have been corrected
	to use their macro equivalents instead.  Some useless ${HEAD}
	-n 1 statements have been removed.  A strange comment in the
	do-install target and an out of place ``fi'' have been fixed as
	well.

	On 5-CURRENT after the 5.2-RELEASE split, the default Perl
	version has been updated from 5.6.1 to 5.8.2.  As well, some
	Perl definitions in bsd.port.mk have been moved to their correct
	locations which corrects the PERL_LEVEL definition.

	The following optimizations have been added to the ports system
	to speed up recursive operations such as make describe, make
	index, make ignorelist, etc.  bsd.gnome.mk is now only included
	if a port defines USE_GNOME, WANT_GNOME, and/or USE_GTK.  More
	variables are cached and passed down through bsd.port.subdir.mk.
	Perl is no longer invoked when a simple ``echo'' will do.  More
	subshell variable assignments have been hidden behind
	conditionals so that the commands are not spawned everytime.
	Finally, dependency lists are only constructed if ports actually
	declare dependencies.  These optimizations give make index
	approximately a 43% speedup.

	If CPUFLAGS is not defined (this _CPUCFLAGS is empty), trying
	to remove _CPUCFLAGS from CFLAGS will result in an error.  This
	change fixes that.

	On recent versions of 5.X, /etc/rc.subr exists, and there is no
	reason to install another copy in ${LOCALBASE}/etc.  The reason
	this was ever done was to workaround some build issues on bento.
	However, testing OSVERSION seems to work in spite of those build
	issues.

	The ports system now supports MySQL 3.23, 4.0, 4.1, and 5.0.
	Also, the ability to scale to newer versions was also but in
	place.

	An .endif comment indicated that the .if block checked
	WANT_MYSQL when, in fact, it was checking WANT_MYSQL_VER.  This
	has been corrected.

	The PTHREAD{CFLAGS,LIBS} macros have been made overridable on
	all versions of FreeBSD to allow for alternate threading
	implementations (e.g. -lc_r, -lthr, -mt, etc.).  The default
	threading library has been changed to -lpthread from -lc_r on
	-CURRENT.

	The new SIZE support broke distfiles fetching on FreeBSD < 4.8.
	On those versions of FreeBSD, the SIZE distfile attribute is now
	ignored.  Also, defining DISABLE_SIZE in, for example,
	/etc/make.conf, will ignore the SIZE attribute on all versions
	of FreeBSD.  This is useful with alternate values for FETCH_CMD.

	A new vulnerabilities database has been added to the ports
	system in order to keep more accurate, up-to-date, track of
	security vulnerabilities.  The ports system now knows how to
	query that database and dynamically prevents the installation
	of vulnerable ports.

	In order to allow for more rapid development of the package
	tools, the ports system will prefer to use pkg_* tools found in
	${LOCALBASE} over those in the base system.  However, all PKG_*
	macros are still overridable.

	A new physical category, net-mgmt, has been created to house
	network management ports.

	The /var/db/port.mkversion file never really took off, and is
	now very obsolete.  Replace the code used to generate and check
	this file with a simple OSVERSION check.  The ports system now
	requires FreeBSD 4.3 or higher.

	The last round of bsd.*.mk changes broke ports that had
	duplicate distinfo entries (e.g. linux_base).  This is now
	fixed.  Along with this fix, only distfiles with a bad checksum
	will be refetched, where as distfiles missing from distinfo will
	not be refetched.

	The PLIST_{DIRS,FILES} macros were passed to the final package
	list unchanged by PLIST_SUB.  This is not always desirable.
	Now, those macros are passed through PLIST_SUB.

	The previous OPTIONS code assumed users would be running port
	build as root.  If this was not the case, OPTIONS configuration
	would fail.  Now, the bits of the config and rmconfig targets
	that require write access to system directories are run under
	SU_CMD.

	The makesum target will now add a SIZE attribute for each
	distfile by default.  This can be overridden by defining NO_SIZE
	in a port's Makefile.  Note: this could probably be expanded to
	omit SIZE attributes for specific distfiles in the future.

20040129:
AUTHOR:	trevor@FreeBSD.org
	SIZE lines in distinfo files:  if you set USE_SIZE when you do "make
	makesum", the byte sizes of the distfiles will be listed in the
	distinfo file. Then, if a distfile is replaced on its master site with
	one of a different size than that listed, "make fetch" will fail with a
	"size mismatch" error before downloading the file and the user will be
	asked to fetch the file by hand. Also, a user will know the size of
	the distfiles before fetching and decide to fetch later.
