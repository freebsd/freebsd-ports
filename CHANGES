AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  * USE_ICONV has been deprecated and converted into the iconv USE
    feature

    USES= iconv

20130207:
AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  * Use of PTHREAD_CFLAGS and PTHREAD_LIBS is unsupported. The former
    expands to the empty string, while the second is simply -pthread.
    Please use -pthread directly in your LDFLAGS, if needed.

AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  * Add a USE_FUSE macro to handle fuse dependencies. It makes
    sure sysutils/fusefs-libs gets installed and depending on
    fuse being in base or not it installs sysutils/fusefs-kmod.

AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org
  * OPTIONS has been extended 2 new macros are available:

    OPTIONS_RADIO - allows only 0 or 1 options to be selected
    OPTIONS_GROUP - allows 0 or N options among to be selected

AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  * IPV6 option is now activated by default for the whole ports tree

20121010:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  * The ports tree is now using pkgng as the default package manager
    for HEAD.  This only affects users of CURRENT -- users of other
    branches need not take any action.

    To keep pkg_install as the default package manager, use the new
    WITHOUT_PKGNG knob in make.conf

20120830:
AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  * CCACHE support for building ports has been added (depends on
    devel/ccache). Therefore new user settable variables are available:

    WITH_CCACHE_BUILD - Enable CCACHE support (Default off)

    NO_CCACHE         - Disable CCACHE support for example for certain
                        ports if CCACHE is enabled.

    By default CCACHE uses $HOME/.ccache as cache directory. To use
    a non-default cache directory this could be overwritten like:

    MAKE_ENV+= CCACHE_DIR=/var/cache/ccache

20120820:
AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  * GitHub support has been integrated into bsd.sites.mk. In order to
    fetch distfiles from GitHub, a port must define USE_GITHUB along
    with the following variables:

    GH_ACCOUNT  - account name of the GitHub user hosting the project
                  default: not set, mandatory

    GH_PROJECT  - name of the project on GitHub
                  default: ${PORTNAME}

    GH_TAGNAME  - name of the tag to download (master, 2.0.1, ...)
                  default: ${DISTVERSION}

    GH_COMMIT   - first 7 digits of the commit that generated GH_TAGNAME
                  (man git-describe(1))
                  default: not set, mandatory

    The port www/tivoka is an example how to use this mechanism.

20120726:
AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  * new macro USE_PKGCONFIG has been introduce in place of
    USE_GNOME= pkgconfig

    USE_PKGCONFIG= yes and USE_PKGCONFIG= build
    for build only dependency

    USE_PKGCONFIG= run
    for run only dependency

    USE_PKGCONFIG= both
    for both build and run dependency

20120715:
AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  * The ports tree moved from CVS to Subversion. A Subversion to
    CVS exporter is in place to continue the support of CVSup but
    do not commit to pcvs directly.

    All commits have to be done in the new port Subversion repository
    on svn.FreeBSD.org. You will find more information about
    Subversion in the Ports Subversion Primer in the FreeBSD wiki,
    in the "Committer's Guide" and the "Porter's Handbook".

    If you are in doubt or unsure about a Subversion operation
    please contact ports@FreeBSD.org.

20120529:
AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  * OPTIONS has been updated with many changes and improvements.

    Old-style OPTIONS declarations will continue to work for a while,
    but do not introduce any into existing or new ports.

    For further information, see the Porter's Handbook section on
    Makefile Options.

20110923:
AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  * LDFLAGS is now passed to both the configure and make environments,
    and should be handled just like CPPFLAGS (see previous entry).

    Summarizing both LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS changes, where you would
    have used
      CONFIGURE_ENV=    CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include" \
                        LDFLAGS="-L${LOCALBASE}/lib"
      MAKE_ENV=         CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include" \
                        LDFLAGS="-L${LOCALBASE}/lib"
    now just use
      CPPFLAGS+=        "-I${LOCALBASE}/include"
      LDFLAGS+=         "-L${LOCALBASE}/lib"

    Note that it's advised to append these variables (+=) instead
    of overriding (=) to allow customization by user.

20110320:
AUTHOR: gerald@FreeBSD.org

  * CPPFLAGS is now passed to both the configure and make environments,
    so this no longer needs to happen in individual ports by adding this
    to CONFIGURE_ENV or MAKE_ENV.  Rather, just set CPPFLAGS in the port
    Makefile (if necessary).

    For example, where you would have used
      CONFIGURE_ENV=    CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include"
      MAKE_ENV=         SOMETHING=foo CPPFLAGS="-I${LOCALBASE}/include"
    now just use
      CPPFLAGS=         "-I${LOCALBASE}/include"
      MAKE_ENV          SOMETHING=foo

20100831:
AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  * USE_GETTEXT has been cleaned up.
    	'build'		BUILD time dependency only
	'run'		RUN time dependency only
	'yes'		LIBRARY dependency

20100606:
AUTHOR: gerald@FreeBSD.org

  * USE_GCC=4.3 is deprecated (and no port uses it anymore). USE_GCC=4.3+
    is transparently rewritten to USE_GCC=4.4+ and lang/gcc43 will be
    disconnected from the USE_GCC infrastructure soon.

20100524:
AUTHOR: alepulver@FreeBSD.org

  * The license support files (bsd.licenses.mk and bsd.licenses.db.mk) from
    GSoc 2008/2009 have been committed. A new PH entry will be available
    soon, but for the moment look at:
    http://wiki.freebsd.org/PortsLicenseInfrastructure
    Or, alternatively, the comments at the beginning of the mentioned files.

20090906:
AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  * There is now a unified way to create users and groups
    in your ports. First, make sure they are added to both
    ports/GIDs and ports/UIDs, then add the following in
    your port:

    USERS=	foo
    GROUPS=	foo

    ... if you want your port to create the foo user and
    group.

20090812:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org

  * sourceforge.net has changed their URL layout to be more
    flexible for their users.  A new bsd.sites.mk macro SFP
    has been added for projects that moved from
    http://${mirror}/sourceforge/%SUBDIR%/
    to
    http://${mirror}/project/%SUBDIR%/
    Note that %SUBDIR% is now highly individual for each
    project and might need changing as well.

20090521:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org

  * bsd.port.options.mk is now clear to be widely used.

20090516:
AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  * APACHE_COMPAT is dead!

  * USE_APACHE=yes is dead!

  * WITH_APACHE13, WITH_APACHE2, WITH_APACHE20, and WITH_APACHE22 are dead

    You should set USE_APACHE=13|20|22+.  WITH_APACHE option can
    be used to conditional include support for ANY version of
    Apache based on APACHE_PORT.  Currently www/apache13

20090207:
AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  * devel/libslang dropped in favor of devel/libslang2

  * WITH_SLANG2 has been removed.  WITH_SLANG now implies
    devel/libslang2.

20080905:
AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  * print/ghostscript-* and related ports have been renamed in the
    following way:

	print/ghostscript-gnu -> print/ghostscript7
	print/ghostscript-gnu-nox11 -> print/ghostscript7-nox11
	print/ghostscript-gnu-commfont -> print/ghostscript7-commfont
	print/ghostscript-gpl -> print/ghostscript8
	print/ghostscript-gpl-nox11 -> print/ghostscript8-nox11
	japanese/ghostscript-gnu-jpnfont -> print/ghostscript7-jpnfont
	korean/ghostscript-gnu-korfont -> print/ghostscript7-korfont

  * USE_GHOSTSCRIPT now supports a version number which the port
    requires.  The valid value is "7" or "8".  If other value is
    specified, value of WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_VER is used.

  * WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_GNU has been removed in favor of
    WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_VER.  The valid value of WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_VER is
    "7" or "8", and the default value is "8".

20080821:
AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

   * CONFIGURE_ARGS is updated to use correct syntax for newer autoconf
     on the configure target. Individual ports no longer need to change
     CONFIGURE_TARGET to have the '--build=' prefix.

20080721:
AUTHOR: pav@FreeBSD.org

  * Default OpenLDAP version was changed from 2.3 to 2.4.

  * USE_GTK and USE_XPM variables are no longer recognized.

20080523:
AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  * By default, ports-mgmt/pkg_install now sets up a wrapper to use ports
    pkg_install (when installed) instead of base when the former is more
    recent. This can be disabled in the options menu, or with the
    WITHOUT_WRAPPER knob.

20080414:
AUTHOR: pav@FreeBSD.org

  * @rmtry is now supported in pkg-plist.

  * USE_DISPLAY made more powerful, see comments in bsd.port.mk for details.

  * ${PW} is now defined.

  * LIB_DEPENDS can now be used with libraries with + sign in their name
    without the need for escaping.

20080312:
AUTHOR: pav@FreeBSD.org

  * USE_XPM no longer implies USE_XLIB.

  * USE_LDCONFIG can now be used to Linux binary ports that install shared
    libraries instead of INSTALLS_SHLIB.

20070908:
AUTHOR:	gabor@FreeBSD.org, linimon@FreeBSD.org

  * The Perl-related code parts have been extracted from bsd.port.mk to
    bsd.perl.mk.  This includes the user-settable knobs (e.g. USE_PERL5)
    and infrastructure parts of the code, like default targets.  The new
    code is designed to be conditionally included based on either
    USE_PERL5_*, PERL_CONFIGURE, or PERL_MODBUILD being set.  However,
    some of the default settings remain in bsd.port.mk while we make
    sure that all ports comply with this.

  * A convenient version handling has been implemented for Perl-related
    knobs.  With this new feature one can require a minimal, a maximal or an
    exact version, that the given port needs.  For the full description and
    some examples, please see the documentation in bsd.perl.mk.

20070804:
AUTHOR: gabor@FreeBSD.org
The following functional changes were made to bsd.*.mk and to
Tools/scripts/security-check.awk:

  * The variable definitions that cover command line tools, e.g. MKDIR, were
    extracted from bsd.port.mk into bsd.commands.mk, so that we can
    reuse them within the infrastructure later.

  * The old DESTDIR implementation was removed both from the infrastructure,
    and from the individual ports.  Variables like TARGETDIR should not longer
    be used.

  * A new DESTDIR implementation has been added, implemented in bsd.destdir.mk.
    The new implementation puts no requirements on the individual ports.

20070730:
AUTHOR: python@FreeBSD.org

  * The default Python version has been changed from 2.4.x to 2.5.x.

  * A number of variables have been added to bsd.python.mk to support
    the more integrated support for Python eggs, including:
    PYDISTUTILS_PKGNAME, PYDISTUTILS_PKGVERSION, PYEASYINSTALL_EGG,
    PYDISTUTILS_NOEGGINFO, PYDISTUTILS_EGGINFO, PYEASYINSTALL_ARCHDEP

  * More detailed descriptions of the variables can be found in the comments
    in bsd.python.mk.

20070723:
AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  * The default CONFIGURE_ARGS when GNU_CONFIGURE is set now contains
    --mandir and --infodir if configure script supports them.

20070712:
AUTHOR: maho@FreeBSD.org

  * Add knob USE_FORTRAN for ports which uses FORTRAN. All ports uses
    FORTRAN compiler should use this knob. Usages are: USE_FORTRAN=yes
    (default;gfortran42), USE_FORTRAN=ifc (Intel FORTRAN compiler)
    and USE_FORTRAN=g77 (/usr/bin/f77 or g77-34).

20070701:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following change was made to the ports infrastructure:

  * Virtual category 'kld' was added.  If the port installs kernel loadable
    modules, it should be included in this category.

20070524:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following changes were made to the ports infrastructure:

  * The 'make-deinstall-all' target now checks for moved ports.

  * The installation directories PORTEXAMPLES and PORTDATA are now defined.

  * The USE_MAKESELF knob is added for ports that use the makeself archiver.

  * The description of fetch-list was updated.  The targets fetch-required-list,
    fetch-url-list, and fetch-urlall-list were added.

  * 'make search' will also now search in ports/MOVED.

  * The default method for 'make update' is now portsnap.  Previously,
    you had to manually select one of 3 methods: SUP_UPDATE, CVS_UPDATE,
    or PORTSNAP_UPDATE.  The latter is now obsolete.

  * Several Makevar definitions have been moved to the pre-makefile section:
    DATADIR, DOCSDIR, ETCDIR, EXAMPLESDIR, WWWDIR.

20070403:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following changes were made to the ports infrastructure:

  * The default dependency of USE_GHOSTSCRIPT has been changed from
    ghostscript-gnu to ghostscript-gpl.  The WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_GPL variable is
    now no-op.  New WITH_GHOSTSCRIPT_GNU variable was added.

  * bsd.tcl.mk was overhauled.  Most importantly, the semantics of USE_TCL* and
    USE_TK* variables was changed.  USE_TCL and USE_TK now implies both build
    and run dependencies, USE_TCL_RUN and USE_TK_BUILD variables were
    introduced. Existing ports in the tree were modified.

  * Unused category 'tcl81' was removed, and new categories 'tcl' and 'tk'
    were added.

20070324:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following changes were made to the ports infrastructure:

  * Default LIBTOOLFILES value was changed from literal `configure'
    to ${CONFIGURE_SCRIPT}.

  * bsd.efl.mk was moved to ports/Mk.  USE_EFL family of macros is now
    generally available to all ports.

  * New macros COPYTREE_BIN and COPYTREE_SHARE were added, to allow
    for easy installation of a tree hierarchy, either with executable (bin)
    or read-only (share) permissions on files.

  * A new variable WWWDIR was added, with default value of
    ${PREFIX}/www/${PORTNAME}.

  * Variables DOCSDIR_REL, DATADIR_REL, EXAMPLESDIR_REL and WWWDIR_REL were
    added for porter's convenience.  They contain the values of their
    respective non-REL variables, except relative to installation PREFIX.

20070313:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following changes were made to the ports infrastructure:

  * bsd.ocaml.mk and bsd.xfce.mk were added.

  * The FETCH_CMD was refactored so that ports can override the command,
    the arguments, or both.

20070306:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following changes were made to the ports infrastructure:

  * The remaining vestiges of FreeBSD 4.X support were removed.  Any
    remaining users of 4.X should have stayed with the RELEASE_4_EOL tag.

  * It is now possible to include USE_PHP after bsd.port.pre.mk.

  * 'make search' should now work with non-default ${PORTSDIR}.

20070130:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following changes were made to the ports infrastructure:

  * DEPENDS variable was removed, please use other *_DEPENDS variables instead.

  * A new pkg-plist keyword is available, @stopdaemon.  It will call forcestop
    on all rc.subr scripts installed by the port on deinstall, effectively
    stopping services on deinstall/upgrade.

  * rc.subr script suffix is now available in Makefile as RC_SUBR_SUFFIX.

  * New variable USE_CDRTOOLS was introduced.  It replaced direct dependencies
    on sysutils/cdrtools port.  It now automatically support switching to
    cdrtools-cjk port when user specified WITH_CJK.  All ports were converted.

  * USE_DOS2UNIX, infrastructure for converting DOS to UNIX line feeds, was
    enhanced by a new variable DOS2UNIX_REGEX.  It allows to specify a find
    -iregex parameter to limit touched files by file extensions.

  * Support for partially translated manpages was added.  For examples of
    usage, please refer to Porter's Handbook.

  * USE_TCL/USE_TK variables were changed to provide runtime dependency.  New
    variables USE_TCL_BUILD and USE_TK_BUILD were added.  All unintuitive
    quirks of these variables were fixed.

  * USE_LDCONFIG was fixed to work properly for ports, that specify @cwd in the
    pkg-plists.

  * Old bsd.java.mk version 1.0 macros were removed.

  * New category: ports-mgmt

  * New virtual category: gnustep

  * Unused 'picobsd' category was removed.

20070118:
AUTHOR: maho@FreeBSD.org
We'd like to ask all ports maintainers, who are using Fortran77 (f77 in base),
to switch to Fortran90/95 (gfortran42, lang/gcc42). Please refer to
http://people.freebsd.org/~maho/gfortran/gfortran.html
for details.

20061014:
AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org
The following changes have been introduced to the GNOME porting process
during the GNOME 2.16 update:

* GNOME is now installed into LOCALBASE.  Any port which makes use of the
  gnomeprefix component will have its PREFIX forced to LOCALBASE

20060930:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following functional changes were made to bsd.port.mk:

  * The bsd.port.mk pre and post includes have been split into 3 pieces
    instead of 2, to allow OPTIONS to be able to influence dependencies.
    This is still experimental and not yet enabled by any port.  This adds
    the file 'bsd.port.options.mk'.

  * bsd.gcc.mk has been updated to understand gfortran.

  * emulators/linux_base is now removed.  linux_base-fc4 has been the default
    for some time.

  * The USE_FIREBIRD macro was added to bsd.database.mk.

20060914:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
 The following functional changes were made to bsd.port.mk:

  * PKGVERSION was introduced as an intermediate variable refactored out of
    PKGNAME.

  * bsd.lua.mk was added to support lua-related ports.

  * DESTDIR was removed from bsd.scons.mk because it was problematic.

  * Some quotes were added to the 'missing' target to improve handling of
    duplicate origins.

20060903:
AUTHOR:	sat@FreeBSD.org
The following functional changes were made to bsd.sites.mk:

  * MASTER_SITES variable can now look like MACRO1/subdir1 MACRO2/subdir2, and
    be expanded in a way that you expect it to, that is apply different subdirs
    to different sites. You can safely replace ${M_S_FOO:S/%SUBDIR%/bar/} with
    FOO/bar.

  * If M_S_SUBDIR is unset, a macro in M_S won't set it anymore, but rather
    substitute %SUBDIR% all by itself. Now it's possible to use macros with
    different default subdirs and they will expand in a proper way.

20060805:
AUTHOR:	sat@FreeBSD.org
The following functional changes were made to bsd.sites.mk:

  * MASTER_SITES variable can now contain special macros which are expanded into
    traditional URL[:group] syntax and cause some convenient effects, e.g. set a
    default M_S_SUBDIR.

  * A macro is any space-delimited word in MASTER_SITES without a forward slash.

  * If MASTER_SITE_<macro> is defined, then the macro is expanded to its value.

  * Abbreviated macros are provided for extremely popular locations, e.g. CPAN
    and SF. To avoid further obfuscation their unabbreviated equivalents should
    be avoided.

  * Popular macros can trigger M_S_SUBDIR to default to a predefined value, e.g.
    ${PORTNAME:L} for SF and ${PORTNAME:C/-.*//} for CPAN.

  * Abbreviations and M_S_SUBDIR defaults are defined by MASTER_SITES_ABBREVS
    and MASTER_SITES_SUBDIRS, both set in bsd.sites.mk.

  * If a macro belongs to a group (e.g. SF:source1), all the sites it expands
    into also belong to the same group.

  * Macros and traditional URL's can be mixed safely, their order stays intact.

20060804:
AUTHOR:	gabor@FreeBSD.org
The following functional changes were made to bsd.*.mk and to
Tools/scripts/security-check.awk:

  * Add DESTDIR support to let one install ports into a jail from outside.
    A package is installed under ${DESTDIR}${PREFIX} now and registered under
    ${DESTDIR}/var/db/pkg.

  * TARGETDIR variable has been added for referencing ${DESTDIR}${PREFIX}.

  * LOCALBASE, LINUXBASE and X11BASE variables point to the final destination
    now, LOCALBASE_REL, LINUXBASE_REL and X11BASE_REL can be used for the
    old behavior.  The behavior has not been changed in PLIST_SUB.
    Note, that the three variables are still overridable with a hack, so this
    change doesn't affect POLA, but necessary for DESTDIR support.

  * OSVERSION is now determined from the userland, not from the kernel.
    Cross-compiling between releases is still not supported, but this
    behavior is more correct for jails with differing userland from
    the kernel version.

  * Add some sanity check for PREFIX and DESTDIR.  This can be skipped by
    defining IGNORE_PATH_CHECKS, but very discouraged.

  * Deinstalling from DESTDIR, determining if a port is already installed in
    DESTDIR, etc. are implemented by chrooting those specific commands.

  * Text changes to reflect that we are installing to DESTDIR, removing from
    DESTDIR, etc.

Note, that this change implements only the infrastructure support.  Ports should
also be implemented to respect DESTDIR.

20060717:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following functional changes were made to bsd.port.mk:

  * Introduces IA32_BINARY_PORT for certain cases where a given port fetches
    and installs compiled i386 binaries.

  * Adds some infrastructure for support of 32-bit i386 apps on amd64.

  * Again fix USE_LDCONFIG logic to make it work with non-default PREFIX to
    fix bug introduced in previous revision.

20060705:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following functional changes were made to bsd.port.mk:

  * Change all bogus uses of BROKEN to IGNORE.  (Note: the BROKEN_WITH_*
    forms are retained for compatibility but deprecated.)  Internally,
    these variables all had already set IGNORE, not BROKEN, so they
    were really misnomers.

  * Fix USE_LDCONFIG with non-default PREFIX.

  * Fix DESKTOP_ENTRIES processing on 4.x.

  * Add 'make missing' to show missing dependencies.

  * Add bsd.scons.mk and bsd.wx.mk.

20060616:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
  The patch in ports/95841 to get rid of remnants of FORCE_PKG_REGISTER
  was backed out because it broke kdelibs3*.

20060616:
AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
The following functional changes were made to bsd.port.mk:

  * Update default MySQL version from 4.1 to 5.0 [1]

  * Update default PHP version from 4 to 5 [2]

  * Update default LDAP version from 2.2 to 2.3 [3]

  * Add support for LDAP version 2.4 [4]

  * Update default linux_base from '8' (Redhat 8) to 'fc4' (Fedora Core 4) [5]

  * Switch default Linux X implementation from XFree86 to X.org to track the
    above [5]

  * Deprecate INSTALLS_SHLIB and replace it by USE_LDCONFIG.  If set to "yes",
    the old behavior is preserved.  Otherwise, it can be set to a list of
    directories to be added to ${PREFIX}/libdata/ldconfig/${UNIQUENAME}.
    Note that this directory is used by ldconfig startup script, it is meant
    to replace ldconfig scripts installed by some ports as (sometimes
    000.${UNQUENAME}.sh) [6]

  * Adds USE_LDCONFIG32 which is like USE_LDCONFIG but the target file is
    ${PREFIX}/libdata/ldconfig32/${UNIQUENAME} instead.  (Note: this should
    only be used on 64-bit architectures) [6]

  * Set the default LANG for tr to be C to avoid some build problems [7]

  * Include bsd.java.mk in both pre and post sections [8]

  * Get rid of remnants of FORCE_PKG_REGISTER [9]

  * Always print options with make showconfig [10]

  * include bsd.emacs.mk only when USE_EMACS is set [5]

  * Correct the implementation of pretty-print-run-depends-list [8]

  * Use a consistent name for the cookies file when PKGNAMEPREFIX/SUFFIX
    are set after bsd.port.pre.mk. [9]

  * Include bsd.tcl.mk if USE_TCL_BUILD is defined [10]

  * Set PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT in BATCH mode [11]

  * Add the {ONLY,NOT}_FOR_ARCH_REASON and
    {ONLY,NOT}_FOR_ARCH_REASON_${ARCH} variables to allow better
    customization of the error string reported to users when they
    attempt a build on an unsupported architecture. [12]

  * Avoid errors from duplicated targets when parsing MLINKS on ports
    without a default value set. [13]

  * Fix handling of MLINKS when invalid entries are listed [14]

  * Enforce sanity of DESKTOP_ENTRIES.  If the Categories field is
    omitted, try to map ports categories to their freedesktop.org
    counterpart [15]

  GNOME has been upgraded from 2.10.2 to 2.12.1.  This update brings with
  it many important porting changes:

  - gtk20's pkg-config file no longer contains the X11 pango modules.
    Therefore, if your port requires these modules, you may have to
    manually patch them in to your port's Makefiles.  Contact
    gnome@FreeBSD.org if you have questions on this.

  - A new USE_GNOME component, ltverhack, has been added.  This
    pseudo-component hacks libtool so that shared library versions are
    more consistent with other operating systems.  Using this component
    can prevent unnecessary shared library version changes.

  - A new macro, INSTALLS_ICONS, has been added.  If your port installs
    Freedesktop-style icons to ${LOCALBASE}/share/icons or
    ${X11BASE}/share/icons, then you should use this macro.  NOTE:
    use of this macro requires your port to set either USE_GNOME or
    WANT_GNOME.

  - USE_LINUX now implies NO_FILTER_SHLIBS=yes. It also doesn't use FreeBSD
    tools to strip binaries anymore, so it's not necessary anymore to override
    STRIP and STRIP_CMD.
  - USE_LINUX_PREFIX implies NO_MTREE now.
  - In the USE_LINUX case, USE_XLIB now depends upon the Linux X11 libraries
    instead upon the native FreeBSD libraries.
  - The variable LINUX_BASE_PORT contains a string which is suitable as an
    item in *_DEPENDS, so if a port BATCH_DEPENDS or FETCH_DEPENDS upon the
    default (or overridden) Linux base, ${LINUX_BASE_PORT} should be used
    instead of a hardcoded reference.
  - If USE_LINUX or OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE doesn't point to an existing linux_base
    port and if USE_LINUX isn't set to "yes" (case insensitive), the port will
    be marked as IGNORE.

  * Fix add-plist-docs target to work correctly with wildcards.

  * Fix USE_MYSQL and USE_PGSQL knobs to work in partial ports
    tree.

  * Introduce 2 new variables: USE_FAM and WANT_FAM_SYSTEM.

    DISABLE_VULNERABILITIES is defined.

  * Switch default MySQL version to 4.1

  * Add support for OpenLDAP v.23

  * Fix add-plist-info and add-plist-post targets to avoid warnings
    from ports which redefine them.

  * Fix add-plist-docs target to handle NOPORTDOCS knob properly.

  * Use INSTALLDIRS="site" in configure for perl ports.

  * Fix NO_(CHECKSUM|BUILD|INSTALL|PACKAGE) knobs if OPTIONS are
    defined.

  * Add an ability to depend on versioned installed package.
    Example:

  The CVSup port has been upgraded with a patch to correct the
  handling of the "refuse" file for files that are in the CVS Attic.
  This solves a problem some people were having, where CVSup would
  delete their ports/INDEX* files even though the files were listed
  in the "refuse" file.  The bug fix is in the cvsupd server, so
  mirror sites  must upgrade their servers in order for this fix to
  help.  Meanwhile, adding "ports/Attic/INDEX*" to the refuse file
  serves as a work-around.

  New GNOME components have been added to bsd.gnome.mk.  See
  http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/gnome2_porting.html for the complete
  list of available GNOME 2 components.

  Py-gnome2 lost many of its GNOME dependencies to a new port,
  py-gnome-extras.  Therefore, ports that used to depend on
  the pygnome2 component for modules such as gtkhtml2, gnomepanel, etc.
  should replace the pygnome2 dependency with pygnomeextras.

  * Speedup check-vulnerable invocation, if portaudit is installed.

  * Run install-info for all .info files.

  * Run add-plist-docs more strictly and prevent some situations
    with leftover files in the future.

  * Introduce two new variables: MASTER_PORT and SLAVE_PORT.
    The results from these variables is only used as information for
    users.

  * Honor OPTIONS if PACKAGE_BUILDING or BATCH are defined.

  * Move all USE_GCC entries to new file - bsd.gcc.mk.  'test-gcc'
    target allows users to check gcc version if USE_GCC is used.
    Give maintainers opportunity to add '+' character to USE_GCC version
    for using specified and higher versions.

    Example:

    USE_GCC=3.3+

    builds ports with gcc version 3.3 and higher (3.4, 4.0).

  * Install startup scripts with the help of USE_RC_SUBR variable.

  * Add three new targets: config-recursive, rmconfig-recursive and
    config-conditional.  You can set or delete OPTIONS for all
    dependencies before every build.  config-conditional target is
    used to skip configuring ports which have already been
    configured.

  * Define new macros: DATE, FMT, MKTEMP, OBJDUMP, and use
    command macro SORT.

  * Change layout of comments to 4 column tabs, remove lots
    of spaces and eight-column-tabs.

  * Introduce 2 new variables: SUB_FILES and SUB_LIST:

    Example:

    SUB_FILES=	pkg-message pkg-install
    SUB_LIST+=	"VERSION=${VERSION}"

    This looks for ${FILESDIR}/pkg-message.in and ${FILESDIR}/pkg-install.in
    Substitutions in SUB_LIST are applied to these files and the
    output is redirected to ${WRKDIR}.

    PKGMESSAGE will be set to ${WRKDIR}/pkg-message.
    PKGINSTALL will be set to ${WRKDIR}/pkg-install.

  * Document DEPRECATED and EXPIRATION_DATE variables.

  * Sanitize the intermittent output by the build infrastructure
    so that cutting and pasting from it no longer interferes
    with GNATS-tags.

  * Honor configure arguments for USE_XLIB if USE/WITH_LIBTOOL_ is
    used.

  * Properly document 'describe' target.

  * Properly remove directories at deinstallation time if ports sets
    a non-standard PREFIX.

  * Defaults INDEXFILE to INDEX-6 on 6-CURRENT.

    target. Avoid recursing into individual port directories and run
    it at top level, after the category README.html files have been
    created.

  * Fix 'search' target and enable a case-insensitive search on 5-x.

  * Extend 'search' target and enable search by categories.

  * Remove 'tk42' and 'tcl76' categories since they're obsolete.

  There has been a big update to PHP ports and bsd.php.mk to add more
  flexibility and new features.
  Now a port may depend on a specific set of PHP extensions.  To do so,
  simply replace:

  USE_PHP=	yes

  with:

  USE_PHP=	ext1 ext2 ext3 ...

  in the port Makefile. A list of all PHP extensions is included in bsd.php.mk.
  If the requirement is a build dependency too, the port should also define:

  USE_PHP_BUILD=yes

  Moreover, the new knob WANT_PHP_SCR has been added to indicate that the port
  requires the 'php' binary to run.
  Last but not least, many common operations to build/install/register a
  PHP extension can now be omitted from the port Makefile if it defines:

  USE_PHPEXT=	yes

  For more information on this point and on additional variables, see
  bsd.php.mk.

  OpenLDAP version 2.2 is now the default.
  When your port links against the openldap client libraries use
    USE_OPENLDAP=	yes
  and do not depend on a particular version. A user (or package
  building cluster) can select the desired flavor with
  WANT_OPENLDAP_VER and WANT_OPENLDAP_SASL, but these must not
  be used in ports Makefiles.

AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org
  USE_LIBTOOL_VER now configures a port to use the ports version of libtool
  instead of its included version.  This was put in place to reduce the
  number of ad hoc patches to individual ports' libtools to prevent .la
  file installation as well as fix various threading problems.

  To restore the previous libtool behavior, use the new macro,
  USE_INC_LIBTOOL_VER.  It works the exact same way as USE_LIBTOOL_VER
  in that it takes a libtool version as its argument.

  For example, to use the included version of libtool with extra hacks
  provided by libtool-1.5, add the following to your Makefile:

  USE_INC_LIBTOOL_VER=	15

  To use the ports version of libtool-1.5, add the following to
  your Makefile:

  USE_LIBTOOL_VER=	15

  Note: these macros are mutually exclusive.  Your port should only include
  one or the other if it needs to make use of libtool.

  The way GConf schema files are installed has changed to support the upcoming
  GNOME 2.8 GConf.  Details about the change can be found at

  been converted to the new style, and portlint has been updated to flag
  old-style GConf schema installation.

  The following behavioral or feature changes were committed:

  * Support verbose index builds with INDEX_VERBOSE

  * Support glob expressions in USE_GETTEXT to allow more flexibility
    in the face of future gratuitous library version bumps by the gettext
    developers:

    USE_GETTEXT=yEs   # Works as before (case-insensitive)
    USE_GETTEXT=[5-7] # Accepts any of those libintl.so.x versions
                      # in the LIB_DEPENDS

  * Extend 'make search' support to allow much more flexible searching
    From the PR:

    Besides the good old key and name variables, this patch adds
    support for path, info, maint, cat, bdeps, and rdeps, which match
    on the appropriate fields, plus their exclusion counterparts: xkey,
    xname, etc.

    Examples:

    Find all ports whose names contain "pear-" but not "html" or "http":

      make search name=pear- xname='ht(tp|ml)'

    Find ports whose names contain "pear-" and which don't have apache
    listed in build-time dependencies:

      make search name=pear- xbdeps=apache

    The positive variables (name, key, maint, etc) are AND-ed, their
    negative versions are OR-ed; in other words, matching any x-
    variable will cause the port to be skipped, mismatch on any non-x-
    variable will cause it to be skipped.

    Examples:

    Find ports that are both in the 'www' category and maintained by
    Thierry Thomas:

      make search maint=thierry@ path=/www/

    Find ports in the 'archivers' category that are either not orphaned
    or don't have "zip" in their names (contrived):

      make search cat=archivers xmaint=ports@freebsd xname=zip

    It is possible to select fields to display.

    Example:

    Find PEAR ports that don't build-depend on apache, displaying only
    Port:, Path:, and Info: lines:

      make search name=pear- xbdeps=apache display=name,path,info

    Case-sensitivity can now be turned of with icase=1.

    Example:

    Find ports with @freebsd.org maintainer addresses without the
    "proper" capitalization (@FreeBSD.org), display their paths and
    maintainer addresses:

      make search maint=@freebsd\\.org icase=0 display=maint,path

    The key and xkey variables can be limited in scope to displayed fields
    by setting keylim to 1.

    Example:

    Find ports that contain "apache" in either of the name, path, info
    fields, ignore the rest of the record (dependencies, maintainer
    address, etc):

      make search key=apache display=name,path,info keylim=1

    The following variables can be set e.g. in /etc/make.conf to
    control default search behavior:

      PORTSEARCH_DISPLAY_FIELDS?=name,path,info,maint,index,bdeps,rdeps
      PORTSEARCH_KEYLIM?=0
      PORTSEARCH_XKEYLIM?=0
      PORTSEARCH_IGNORECASE?=1

  * Extend USE_PERL5_BUILD and USE_PERL5 to add EXTRACT and PATCH
    dependencies

  * While building index, treat non-existent dependencies as fatal.
    Previously the error was being hidden by the stderr
    redirection.

  * Don't always retry BROKEN ports when package building (it is taking
    too much time to continually rebuild ports that are usually going
    to really be broken).  Set TRYBROKEN if you want to attempt a
    build of a BROKEN port.

AUTHOR:	ade@FreeBSD.org
	Over the past few weeks, we have been testing the next
	incarnation of ports/Mk/bsd.autotools.mk on the road to bringing
	at least some semblance of sanity back to this corner of the
	ports collection.

	By far and away the easiest way to see the changes will be to
	view the new file once committed, but here is a summary of the
	changes:

	1. USE_LIBTOOL, USE_AUTOCONF, USE_AUTOHEADER, USE_AUTOMAKE have
	been fully deprecated.  Ports attempting to use these variables
	after the commit will error out, and most obviously break INDEX
	generation, with a helpful error message.  Instead, ports must
	now specifically choose the version of any of these tools that
	they need with the corresponding USE_*_VER variables.  Note that
	these variables understand any and all versions of autotools ports
	in the tree, there is no longer a need to have specific version
	numbers hardcoded in the infrastructure of bsd.autotools.mk
	(as there is now).  In particular, this will immediately open up
	automake18 and autoconf259 for general use and beating.

	2. Similarly for WANT_LIBTOOL, WANT_AUTOCONF, and WANT_AUTOMAKE.
	Again, these have been fully deprecated, and the equivalent
	WANT_*_VER versions should be used.

	In order to preserve existing behavior for these variables, please
	note the 20040314 entry in ports/CHANGES for the appropriate
	version numbers to use for any ports in the GNATS queue.

	Both WANT_* and USE_* bring in the relevant tool as a build
	dependency, and set up a reasonably large number of variables
	pointing to the right programs to be using in the port.  The
	only difference at the moment, is that USE_* will run an extra
	autotools-related configuration step, whereas WANT_* merely
	requests the environment.

	3. The helper knob USE_LIBLTDL has been added which currently
	simply adds a LIB dependency on the libltdl port.

	4. Three new variables have been introduced,
	WANT_{LIBTOOL,AUTOCONF,AUTOMAKE}_RUN=yes.  These variables will
	do nothing by themselves (a Work-In-Progress), but if the
	appropriate autotool version is defined (either through
	WANT_*_VER or USE_*_VER), this will add the relevant dependency
	to RUN_DEPENDS.

	Steps 3 and 4 now essentially negate the need for any kind of
	direct dependency within a non-autotools port Makefile on
	devel/autoconf*, devel/automake*, devel/libtool*, and devel/libltdl.

20040416:
AUTHOR:	java@FreeBSD.org
	There has been a couple of bsd.java.mk tweaks and fixes.

	. Features from Stage 2 has been removed.  A port can no
	  longer use the JDK dependency features by setting JAVA_HOME.
	  Use JAVA_PREFERRED_PORT instead (see below).

	. The default JDK port now depends on OS version:
	  java/diablo-jdk13 for 4.x, and java/jdk14 for 5.x

	. It is now possible for the user (and the porters) to
	  define a list of preferred JDK ports to build and run ports.
	  The port will use the first JDK port from the list that
	  matches the requirements specified in the Makefile.
	  JAVA_PREFERRED_PORT contains a list of suitable JDK ports
	  (sorted by preference).  Names for JDKs may be found in
	  bsd.java.mk, listed in ${_JAVA_PORTS_ALL} (e.g.
	  "JAVA_PORT_NATIVE_BSDJAVA_1_4").

	. JAVA_PORT_VERSION is now set to the full version number
	  of the chosen JDK (e.g. "1.4.2").  Porters will find hints
	  regarding how to obtain the same behavior as before in the
	  header of bsd.java.mk.

20040414:
AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	When writing a port that uses GTK+ 2.X, you can now list the dependency
	with "USE_GNOME=gtk20" which is preferable to LIB_DEPENDS because the
	GTK+ library version only needs to be changed in bsd.gnome.mk.

	Please see http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/porting.html for all
	the available GNOME components as well as detailed instructions on
	creating ports that use the GNOME infrastructure.

20040404:
AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	The glib20 and gtk20 ports were updated to 2.4.0.  This new version
	is completely source and binary compatible with the previous 2.2.x
	series.  However, certain API calls have been deprecated.  If your
	port defines the following macros, they may refuse to build with
	the new versions of glib20 and gtk20:

GTK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
GDK_DISABLE_DEPRECATED
G_DISABLE_DEPRECATED

	The temporary solution is to either patch your port's Makefiles to,
	or use an in-place regular expression to remove these macros.  The
	more permanent solution is to wait until the port's authors update
	their code to use current API calls.

20040402:
AUTHOR:	java@FreeBSD.org
	There has been a big update to bsd.java.mk.  However, this update
	is mostly backwards compatible, so it shouldn't affect most java
	port maintainers.  There is some new functionality and minor
	changes worth documenting here though.

	bsd.java.mk now provides a new set of macros to be used by ports that
	require a JDK. When USE_JAVA is set, the following variables may be set
	in order to give to precision regarding the requirements of the port:

	. JAVA_VERSION
	  A list of space-separated suitable java versions for the
	  port. An optional "+" allows you to specify a range of versions.
	  (allowed values: 1.1[+] 1.2[+] 1.3[+] 1.4[+])
	  (NOTE: Used to be set by bsd.java.mk)
	. JAVA_OS
	  A list of space-separated suitable JDK port operating systems
	  for the port. (allowed values: native linux)
	  (NOTE: Used to be set by bsd.java.mk)
	. JAVA_VENDOR
	  A list of space-separated suitable JDK port vendors for
	  the port. (allowed values: freebsd bsdjava sun ibm blackdown)
	  (NOTE: Used to be set by bsd.java.mk)
	. JAVA_BUILD
	  When set, it means that the selected JDK port should be
	  added to build dependencies for the port.
	. JAVA_RUN
	  This variable works exactly the same as JAVA_BUILD but
	  regarding run dependencies.

	Here are some of the macros defined after setting USE_JAVA:

	. JAVA_PORT
	  The name of the JDK port (e.g. java/jdk14)
	. JAVA_HOME
	  The home of the JDK port in the local base
	. JAVA_PORT_VERSION
	  The version of the JDK port.
	  (NOTE: Used to be JAVA_VERSION, see above)
	. JAVA_PORT_OS
	  The operating system used by the JDK port.
	  (NOTE: Used to be JAVA_OS, see above)
	. JAVA_PORT_VENDOR
	  The vendor of the JDK port.
	  (NOTE: Used to be JAVA_VENDOR, see above)

	Plus many macros for the commonly used java executables:

		APPLETVIEWER, JAR, JAVA, JAVAC, JAVADOC, JAVAH,
		JAVAP, JAVA_KEYTOOL, JAVA_N2A, JAVA_POLICYTOOL,
		JAVA_SERIALVER, RMIC, RMID and RMIREGISTRY.

	bsd.java.mk 2.0 is mostly backward compatible with the previous
	version, save for the notes above and changed internal variables.
	Using the new features is strongly encouraged, since the old
	bsd.java.mk 1.0 features will be deprecated and may be removed in
	the future.

	The print/freetype2 port has been updated to 2.1.7.  This update
	changes some of the internal FreeType API.  Applications may need
	to be patched to support this new API.  If a source files includes
	freetype/freetype.h, make sure ft2build.h is included before
	freetype/freetype.h.  The proper way to do this is:

#include <ft2build.h>
#include FT_FREETYPE_H

	However, the following will work as well, but is deprecated:

#include <ft2build.h>
#include <freetype/freetype.h>

	USE_LIBTOOL, USE_AUTOCONF, and USE_AUTOMAKE are now considered
	deprecated, and will be removed on or around June 1st 2004.
	All ports should now choose the specific version of the tool,
	using USE_LIBTOOL_VER, USE_AUTOCONF_VER, and USE_AUTOMAKE_VER.
	The old "system default" behavior can be written as follows:

	Old			New
	USE_LIBTOOL=yes		USE_LIBTOOL_VER=13
	USE_AUTOCONF=yes	USE_AUTOCONF_VER=213
	USE_AUTOMAKE=yes	USE_AUTOMAKE_VER=14

	New variable MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE_EXTENDED. It has the
	ten official sourceforge.net download mirrors, whereas
	MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE only has five. To check if your
	port is mirrored there, go to
	<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/${MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR}/>
	click on ${DISTFILES} and you'll see five or ten mirrors,
	corresponding to the variables above.

	The default version of Ruby is now 1.8 on all platforms
	including the i386.

	Users on the i386 platform need to follow the instructions
	described in the UPDATING file to cope with this upgrade.

	Next time ruby is major upgraded, you won't need to do this
	kind of messy work because some subtle changes have been made
	to the ruby port infrastructure to make it easier to handle
	multiple versions of ruby.

AUTHOR:	gnome@FreeBSD.org
	Mozilla will now default to using GTK2, and will only compile
	against Gtk+-1.2 if explicitly requested.  This is in exact
	opposite to the old behavior.

	The valid values of WITH_MOZILLA are now:
		mozilla			(www/mozilla, GTK2)
		mozilla-devel		(www/mozilla-devel, GTK2)
		mozilla-gtk1		(www/mozilla-gtk1, GTK1)
		mozilla-devel-gtk1	(www/mozilla-devel-gtk1, GTK1)

	As before, WITH_MOZILLA can be set in /etc/make.conf, but doing
	so is not advised unless you desire the development versions.
	GTK2 browsers will automatically compile against GTK2 mozilla,
	and GTK1 browsers (galeon1, galeon1, and galeon1) will
	automatically compile against GTK1.

	Again, the only people who will need to take action are those
	who desire development versions (which are inactive at this time
	anyway).  Those who want GTK1 mozilla-devel must set
	WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-devel-gtk1 or they will be pleasantly
	surprised with their very own GTK2 installation on the next
	update.

	WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-gtk2 and WITH_MOZILLA=mozilla-devel-gtk2
	are still honored for the time being, but their use is
	now deprecated.  Any new ports are not required to consider
	their values, and so eventually WITH_MOZILLA _will_ have to
	be changed.

	Hopefully galeon2 can catch up to peoples' expectations from
	galeon1 soon, and we can remove the GTK1 ports altogether.


20040204:
AUTHOR:	portmgr@FreeBSD.org
	The bsd.php.mk file has been moved out of the lang/php4 port
	into the Mk directory.  This will make it much easier to include
	PHP support in PHP-dependent ports.  Instead of including
	bsd.php.mk directly, a port can simply set USE_PHP=yes, and the
	ports system with Do the Right Thing.

	All trailing whitespace has been removed from bsd.port.mk.

	Enhance the new OPTIONS code by only including saved options if
	the port defines OPTIONS, attempt to use LATEST_LINK as the
	unique name for a port (fall back to ${PKGNAMEPREFIX}${PORTNAME}
	otherwise), bring the ===> messages in line with the existing
	ones by using PKGNAME instead of PORTNAME, use PKGNAME in the
	dialog, use ECHO_CMD instead of ECHO_MSG to write the
	OPTIONSFILE, display a message during compilation indicating
	that user-specified options have been found, and make the output
	of the showconfig target a little more user-friendly.

	A new USE_ICONV macro has been added that takes the place of an
	explicit LIB_DEPENDS on converters/libiconv.  This will help
	with future shared lib version bumps.

	A new USE_GETTEXT macro has been added that takes the place of
	an explicit LIB_DEPENDS on devel/gettext.  This will help with
	future shared lib version bumps.

	Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing
	Perl modules.  It will eventually replace the obsoleted
	ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Many new Perl modules have already
	switched to using Build.PL instead of Makefile.PL.  To
	facilitate building those modules, a new PERL_MODBUILD macro has
	been added.  Use that in place of PERL_CONFIGURE when porting
	Perl modules that make use of the Module::Build framework.

	Certain ports want to check for the availability of SDL
	libraries before including them.  This change adds a new
	WANT_SDL macro similar to WANT_GNOME.  By setting this, the
	porter indicates that her port can optional use SDL if present
	on the system.  WANT_SDL should be defined _before_
	bsd.port.pre.mk is included.  After including bsd.port.pre.mk,
	the list of available SDL components will be returned in the
	HAVE_SDL macro.  For details on how to process this component
	list, refer to bsd.sdl.mk.

	The OpenBSD and NetBSD projects diverged from the FreeBSD ports
	tree years ago, and it no longer make sense to include obsolete
	references to incorrect paths in the FreeBSD ports system.  This
	change removes the NetBSD and OpenBSD PORTSDIR compatibility
	bits from bsd.port.mk.

	The comment for PKGDIR read, ``A direction containing any
	package creating file.''  The word ``direction'' should be
	``directory.''  This has been fixed.

	A new DIRNAME macro has been added that points to
	/usr/bin/dirname.  All direct use of dirname in ports can be
	switched to this macro.

	Direct use of commands dirname, id, and rm have been corrected
	to use their macro equivalents instead.  Some useless ${HEAD}
	-n 1 statements have been removed.  A strange comment in the
	do-install target and an out of place ``fi'' have been fixed as
	well.

	On 5-CURRENT after the 5.2-RELEASE split, the default Perl
	version has been updated from 5.6.1 to 5.8.2.  As well, some
	Perl definitions in bsd.port.mk have been moved to their correct
	locations which corrects the PERL_LEVEL definition.

	The following optimizations have been added to the ports system
	to speed up recursive operations such as make describe, make
	index, make ignorelist, etc.  bsd.gnome.mk is now only included
	if a port defines USE_GNOME, WANT_GNOME, and/or USE_GTK.  More
	variables are cached and passed down through bsd.port.subdir.mk.
	Perl is no longer invoked when a simple ``echo'' will do.  More
	subshell variable assignments have been hidden behind
	conditionals so that the commands are not spawned every time.
	Finally, dependency lists are only constructed if ports actually
	declare dependencies.  These optimizations give make index
	approximately a 43% speedup.

	If CPUFLAGS is not defined (this _CPUCFLAGS is empty), trying
	to remove _CPUCFLAGS from CFLAGS will result in an error.  This
	change fixes that.

	On recent versions of 5.X, /etc/rc.subr exists, and there is no
	reason to install another copy in ${LOCALBASE}/etc.  The reason
	this was ever done was to workaround some build issues on bento.
	However, testing OSVERSION seems to work in spite of those build
	issues.

	The ports system now supports MySQL 3.23, 4.0, 4.1, and 5.0.
	Also, the ability to scale to newer versions was also but in
	place.

	An .endif comment indicated that the .if block checked
	WANT_MYSQL when, in fact, it was checking WANT_MYSQL_VER.  This
	has been corrected.

	The PTHREAD{CFLAGS,LIBS} macros have been made overridable on
	all versions of FreeBSD to allow for alternate threading
	implementations (e.g. -lc_r, -lthr, -mt, etc.).  The default
	threading library has been changed to -lpthread from -lc_r on
	-CURRENT.

	The new SIZE support broke distfiles fetching on FreeBSD < 4.8.
	On those versions of FreeBSD, the SIZE distfile attribute is now
	ignored.  Also, defining DISABLE_SIZE in, for example,
	/etc/make.conf, will ignore the SIZE attribute on all versions
	of FreeBSD.  This is useful with alternate values for FETCH_CMD.

	A new vulnerabilities database has been added to the ports
	system in order to keep more accurate, up-to-date, track of
	security vulnerabilities.  The ports system now knows how to
	query that database and dynamically prevents the installation
	of vulnerable ports.

	In order to allow for more rapid development of the package
	tools, the ports system will prefer to use pkg_* tools found in
	${LOCALBASE} over those in the base system.  However, all PKG_*
	macros are still overridable.

	A new physical category, net-mgmt, has been created to house
	network management ports.

	The /var/db/port.mkversion file never really took off, and is
	now very obsolete.  Replace the code used to generate and check
	this file with a simple OSVERSION check.  The ports system now
	requires FreeBSD 4.3 or higher.

	The last round of bsd.*.mk changes broke ports that had
	duplicate distinfo entries (e.g. linux_base).  This is now
	fixed.  Along with this fix, only distfiles with a bad checksum
	will be refetched, where as distfiles missing from distinfo will
	not be refetched.

	The PLIST_{DIRS,FILES} macros were passed to the final package
	list unchanged by PLIST_SUB.  This is not always desirable.
	Now, those macros are passed through PLIST_SUB.

	The previous OPTIONS code assumed users would be running port
	build as root.  If this was not the case, OPTIONS configuration
	would fail.  Now, the bits of the config and rmconfig targets
	that require write access to system directories are run under
	SU_CMD.

	The makesum target will now add a SIZE attribute for each
	distfile by default.  This can be overridden by defining NO_SIZE
	in a port's Makefile.  Note: this could probably be expanded to
	omit SIZE attributes for specific distfiles in the future.

20040129:
AUTHOR:	trevor@FreeBSD.org
	SIZE lines in distinfo files:  if you set USE_SIZE when you do "make
	makesum", the byte sizes of the distfiles will be listed in the
	distinfo file. Then, if a distfile is replaced on its master site with
	one of a different size than that listed, "make fetch" will fail with a
	"size mismatch" error before downloading the file and the user will be
	asked to fetch the file by hand. Also, a user will know the size of
	the distfiles before fetching and decide to fetch later.
