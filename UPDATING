This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20200207:
  AFFECTS: users of security/nss
  AUTHOR: lwhsu@FreeBSD.org

  NSS header files and libraries have been moved from ${PREFIX}/include/nss/nss
  and ${PREFIX}/lib/nss to ${PREFIX}/include/nss and ${PREFIX}/lib

20200204:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The PYTHON2 and PYTHON3 options have been turned into a single PYTHON
  option that uses whichever python you've set as default. However,
  this means that you cannot have both python2 and python3 support at
  the same time.

20200126:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/gstreamer1-plugins[-bad]
  AUTHOR: kwm@freebsd.org

  In GStreamer 1.16 some files moved from the gstreamer1-plugins-bad package
  to the gstreamer1-plugins package.

  If your using a tool like portmaster or portupgrade delete the old -bad
  port and then follow the normal upgrade method.
  # pkg delete -f gstreamer1-plugins-bad

20200126:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/helm
  AUTHOR: danilo@FreeBSD.org

  The Helm project have deprecated the Tiller utility in Helm 3. If you are using
  Helm 2 you will need to migrate the configuration to be compatible with Helm 3.
  Please, refer to the following documentation for more information about the
  migration process:

  https://helm.sh/blog/migrate-from-helm-v2-to-helm-v3/

  Note that the 2to3 plugin binary is not available for FreeBSD and you will need
  to compile it yourself.

20200113:
  AFFECTS: users of python and net/samba410, devel/talloc, devel/tevent, databases/tdb, databases/ldb*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  In the entry 20191216 for the Python update the filtering constrains
  are too limiting and omit the Samba supplimentary libraries, which do
  have Python bindings to the default Python 3.x version. With the update
  of the default Python3 version you also need to rebuild all the
  supplimentary Samba libraries and samba410 itself.

  For portmaster users it would be enough to run:

  # portmaster devel/talloc devel/tevent databases/tdb databases/ldb15 net/samba410


20200109:
  AFFECTS: www/firefox
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  Firefox requires Capsicum since r522464 for IPC and in future will
  require Capsicum for process sandboxing. If you use a custom kernel
  make sure to copy the following lines from GENERIC kernel:

    options 	CAPABILITY_MODE		# Capsicum capability mode
    options 	CAPABILITIES		# Capsicum capabilities

20200107:
  AFFECTS: Users of *-emacs27-* packages
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  There is a major version bump in 28.0.50, therefore to upgrade all the
  packages dependent on editors/emacs-devel, please use the following commands:

    # sh
    # for i in $(pkg query -g %n '*-emacs27*'); do \
        nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/emacs27/emacs28/'); \
        pkg set -yn "$i":"$nn"; done;
    # pkg upgrade

20200106:
  AFFECTS: users of net/gnatsd
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  net/gnatsd has been replaced by net/nats-server to reflect the
  new naming upstream.

  All options in rc.conf should be renamed by replacing 'gnats'
  with 'nats' (nats_enable, nats_user, nats_options).

20200101:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl and security/openssl111
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The openssl port was removed on 2019-12-31, subsequently the openssl111
  port was renamed to openssl on 2020-01-01.

  The shared library version of OpenSSL has been bumped.

  Users of DEFAULT_VERSIONS= ssl=openssl111 must update this to
  ssl=openssl.

  You must rebuild all ports that depend on OpenSSL if you use OpenSSL
  from ports.

20191226:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/dsbmd
  AUTHOR: mk@freeshell.de

  With version 1.10 dsbmd now uses sysutils/fusefs-jmtpfs for mounting
  MTP devices. Please adjust your dsbmd.conf or recreate it from the new
  dsbmd.conf.sample.

20191225:
  AFFECTS: multimedia/libva-intel-media-driver
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  As of libva 2.6.0 iHD driver is automatically enabled, so you no
  longer need to adjust LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME in ~/.profile or ~/.login.

20191221:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab2
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  If you upgrade from a pevious version, make a backup of
        /var/db/openhab2
  read about the breaking changes in the release notes at
        https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/2.5.0
  and run
        %%PREFIX%%/libexec/openhab2/runtime/bin/update.freebsd
  which takes care about changes for:
        - Textual Configuration
        - Next Generation Rule Engine

20191216:
  AFFECTS: users of python
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  Default version of python3 and python was switched to 3.7.

  For ports users wanting to keep version 3.6 as default,
  add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= python=3.6 python3=3.6 to make.conf

  This may ease the upgrade for users of pre-build packages:
  # sh
  # for i in $(pkg query -g %n 'py36-*'); do pkg set -yn ${i}:py37-${i#py36-}; done
  # pkg upgrade

  For portmaster users:
  # portmaster -o lang/python37 python36
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o py36-\* | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f py36-\*
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # REBUILD=$(pkg query -g "%n:%dn" '*' | grep py3 | grep -v py37 | cut -d : -f 1 | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD
  # REBUILD2=$(pkg list | grep python-36 | xargs pkg which | awk '{print $6}' | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD2

20191204
  AFFECTS: users of mail/nextcloud-mail
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  Version 0.20.0 removed the default mail configuration via config.php.
  All users will be prompted to enter account and SMTP- and IMAP-server
  details for sending and reading email.

20191126:
  AFFECTS: consumers of net/py-urllib3
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Since version 1.25 HTTPS connections are now verified by default which is
  done via "cert_reqs = 'CERT_REQUIRED'".  While certificate verification
  can be disabled via "cert_reqs = 'CERT_NONE'", it's highly recommended to
  leave it on.

  Various consumers of net/py-urllib3 already have implemented routines that
  either explicitly enable or disable HTTPS certificate verification (e.g.
  via configuration settings, CLI arguments, etc.).

  Yet it may happen that there are still some consumers which don't
  explicitly enable/disable certificate verification for HTTPS connections
  which could then lead to errors (as is often the case with self-signed
  certificates).

  In case of an error one should try first to temporarily disable
  certificate verification of the problematic urllib3 consumer to see if
  this approach will remedy the issue.

20191125:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu31 has been updated to 4.1.1. Previous 3.1.X branch has
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu31. If someone wants to stick with 3.1.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install emulators/qemu31
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu31 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu31 emulators/qemu

20191124:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/eggdrop
  AUTHOR: dbaio@FreeBSD.org

  The irc/eggdrop port has been updated to 1.8.4 and its config is not
  backward compatible with 1.6.21. A new port was created to keep 1.6.21
  version available at irc/eggdrop16 and it will be available for 3 months
  until users have time to upgrade their configuration.

  More information at:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eggheads/eggdrop/v1.8.4/NEWS

  If you would like to keep using 1.6.21, please run the following command
  to update pkg database:

    pkg set -n eggdrop:eggdrop16
    pkg set -o irc/eggdrop:irc/eggdrop16

20191108:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis[-devel]
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to the recent stable release.
  Users wanting to stay on v4.x can replace databases/redis with
  databases/redis4 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install databases/redis4
    or
  # portmaster -o databases/redis4 databases/redis
    or
  # portupgrade -o databases/redis4 databases/redis

20191103:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v13.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node12, has been created for the
  v12.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v12.x can replace www/node
  with www/node12 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node12
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node12 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node12 www/node

20191029:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/open-vm-tools[-nox11]
  AUTHOR: jpaetzel@FreeBSD.org

open-vm-tools 11.0.1 has removed the vmxnet driver.  This driver has been
in tree for quite some time and hopefully everyone is using the in tree
version, however if you had removed device vmx from your kernel, or are
running an unsupported version of FreeBSD which didn't have the driver
included in the base system, updating your open-vm-tools version will
leave you without networking.

20191026:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.12.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20191025:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver (and slave ports)
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  x11/nvidia-driver* ports no longer install Linux programs and libraries,
  which had been moved to their own ports (x11/linux-nvidia-libs*).  When
  updating the driver package next time, remember to install them manually
  if you need to run Linux OpenGL programs.

20191016:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE Plasma Desktop (x11/plasma5*)
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  With Plasma 5.17 the startup script has been renamed. People who use the
  .xinitrc method to start Plasma have to call the new binary.

  Previously:
  	exec ck-launch-session startkde
  Change to:
  	exec ck-launch-session startplasma-x11

20191014:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/rspamd, mail/rspamd-devel
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@FreeBSD.org

  Sample configuration files has been removed as default configuration files
  are NOT intended for modification by users and SHOULD be overwritten on
  port upgrade.

  Make sure the default configuration files are unmodified and migrate all
  configuration changes to the proper places, before you continue.

20191002:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/groff
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  with groff 1.2.4_3, groff does not depend anymore on ghostscript and
  netpbm. In order to be able to properly use the html backend the user
  can install ghostscript and netpbm from ports without the need of
  reinstalling the package.

  Also note that the X11 option has been removed.

20190930:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Since the 2.6 release a running Redis server instance is required for
  caching objects to run.  Also the following settings like below need to be
  added (or modified) in the existing configuration.py:

  REDIS = {
    'HOST': 'localhost',
    'PORT': 6397,
    'PASSWORD': ''
    'DATABASE': 0,
    'CACHE_DATABASE': 1,
    'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
    'SSL': False,
  }

  Note that if you were using these settings in a prior release with
  webhooks, the DATABASE setting remains the same but an additional
  CACHE_DATABASE settings has been added with a default value of 1 to
  support the caching backend.

  The DATABASE setting will be renamed in a future release of NetBox to
  better relay the meaning of the setting.  It is highly recommended to keep
  the webhook and cache databases separate.  Using the same database number
  for both may result in webhook processing data being lost during cache
  flushing events.

  Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20190927:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-devel
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  qemu-devel has been updated to 4.1.0 and 4.0.0 has been merged into a new port
  emulators/qemu40. If you want to stick with 4.0.X branch, simply use:
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu-devel emulators/qemu40

20190927:
  AFFECTS: users of XFCE desktop (x11-wm/xfce4)
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Due to changes in the XFCE 4.14 metaport, systems could end up with
  both xscreensaver and xfce4-screensaver installed and enabled
  simultaneously.

  This can cause conflicts and problems unlocking the screen.

  To avoid problems, please make sure to have only one enabled by
  going to the Application Autostart tab of the Session and Startup
  settings applet and enable only one Screensaver there.

  Some further information can be found in the xfce4-session
  pkg-message displayed on installation and upgrade.

20190920:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/pushgateway
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  The persistent storage format used by pushgateway in the latest version
  is not backwards compatible. See the pushgateway changelogs for details.

20190911:
  AFFECTS: users of security/bastillion
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The datastore of bastillion needs to be updated:
    java -jar $PREFIX/jetty_bastillion/upgrade/bastillion-upgrade-3.08.00.jar \
      $PREFIX/jetty_bastillion/bastillion/WEB-INF/classes/BastillionConfig.properties

20190909:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby25
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.5 to 2.6.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.5 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.5 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.5

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20190906:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-fabric
  AUTHOR: dbaio@FreeBSD.org

  Fabric (devel/py-fabric) was upgraded to 2.5.0, Fabric (2+) represents
  a near-total reimplementation and reorganization of the software.

  Fabric 2 is not at 100% feature parity with 1.x! Some features have been
  explicitly dropped, but others simply have not been ported over yet,
  either due to time constraints or because said features need to be
  re-examined in a modern context.

  More information at:
  https://www.fabfile.org/upgrading.html#upgrading
  https://www.fabfile.org/upgrading.html#upgrade-specifics

  If you would like to keep using 1.x, please run the following command to
  update pkg database:

    pkg set -n py27-fabric:py27-fabric1
    pkg set -o devel/py-fabric:devel/py-fabric1

20190830:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Make sure you upgrade your PostgreSQL to version 11 as described in 20190829,
  before you upgrade your gitlab-ce version.
  Gitlab-ce 12.1 needs at least PostgreSQL version 9.6.

  After this you can follow the usual upgrade guide:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/12.0-12.1-freebsd.md

20190829:
  AFFECTS: users of database/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 9.5 to 11.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 9.5.19, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql95-server postgresql95-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql95-server-9.5.19.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql95-contrib-9.5.19.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib databases/postgresql95-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data11 -U pgsql"
  # chown -R postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data/
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /usr/local/pgsql/data/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data11/ -U pgsql "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres". The migration steps above preserve
     the "pgsql" database user while the database daemon is now executed as the "postgres" FreeBSD user.
  2) The default data dir changed from "/usr/local/pgsql/data/" to "/var/db/postgres/data11/"
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20190816:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  Riak support has been removed by upstream. For update instructions from
  19.05, please refer to:

  https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/upgrade/from_19.05_to_19.08/

20190812:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.30.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20161103, it should still be the same.

20190801:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ot-recorder
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The data directory has moved from /var/spool/owntracks to
  /var/db/owntracks

  Be sure to stop otrecorder, move the directory, and start otrecorder.

  service ot-recorder stop
  cd /var/spool
  mv owntracks /var/db
  service ot-recorder start

20190728:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  The support for Python 2.7 has been dropped with the 1.1.0 release of
  net/py-matrix-synapse.

  Users that still use the Python 2.7 version of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  should switch to a newer Python version, e.g. 3.6, which is the default
  Python version since April 2019.

20190717:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/zetacoin and net-p2p/zetacoin-nox11
  AUTHOR: daniel@morante.net

  Zetacoin will default to using modern versions of BDB (5.x or 6.x) when
  the WALLET option is selected.   See pkg-help for explanation.

  The zetacoin-nox11 slave port was renamed to zetacoin-daemon to align
  with the net-p2p/bitcoin format.

  The zetacoin-cli and zetacoin-tx utilities have been re-packaged into
  a separate port. If you require these programs, or use the zetacoin-cli
  program to access the daemon or the GUI, install net-p2p/zetacoin-utils
  to reinstall them.

20190717:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/py-borgmatic
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for borgmatic's configurations changed. We moved it
  from '/etc/borgmatic' to '/usr/local/etc/borgmatic' in order to follow
  recommended standards used on FreeBSD.

20190710:
  AFFECTS: users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 or c6_64 in /etc/make.conf
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  On amd64 adding DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 to /etc/make.conf made Linux
  infrastructure ports (linux_base-c6 and linux-c6*) install i386 CentOS 6
  packages.  Using c6_64 instead of c6 made them install mixed amd64/i386
  CentOS 6 packages and allowed Linux application ports to install amd64
  binaries when available.  The i386-only configuration was only useful for
  users of x11/nvidia-driver* which didn't provide Linux amd64 emulation
  until recently.

  With x11/nvidia-driver* now supporting Linux amd64 there's no longer a
  need for i386-only Linux on amd64 so DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 has been
  changed to make Linux infrastructure ports install mixed amd64/i386
  CentOS 6 packages, like c6_64 before, and support for c6_64 has been
  removed.

  Users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 should reinstall linux_base-c6 and
  all packages that depend on it.  A list of dependent packages can be
  obtained with the following command:

    pkg info -r linux_base-c6

  Users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6_64 only need to replace c6_64 with
  c6 in /etc/make.conf.

  Users of x11/nvidia-driver* should upgrade to FreeBSD 11.3 or 12.0 if
  they want to run Linux amd64 OpenGL programs.  If you are running an
  older version you may want to postpone installing or updating Linux
  application ports until you find the time to upgrade because application
  ports may install amd64 binaries now.  Infrastructure ports are safe to
  reinstall, and so is x11/nvidia-driver*.

  On i386 nothing has changed.

  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  You must at first upgrade to version 11.11.5 before you can upgrade
  to version 12.
  Support for MySQL will be dropped with next version.
  Make sure you use at least PostgreSQL version 9.6.
  Follow the normal upgrade manual that can be found here:

  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio which bought a license for the non-free features
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  Version 2 of serviio needs a new license file. Updating without a new license
  file will disable the non-free features.

20190701:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql56-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.6 to 5.7.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.6 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.6 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql=5.6

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  # pkg set -o databases/mysql56-client:databases/mysql57-client
  # pkg set -o databases/mysql56-server:databases/mysql57-server
  # pkg upgrade

20190630:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba410
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  If you used Samba in AD/DC mode with the previous versions of the port on UFS2
  backed storage you have to add usage of vfs_freebsd VFS module for at least
  SYSVOL share and configure it to use 'legacy' mode(see manpage).

  The reason behind this is that previous versions Samba port used a hack to
  workaround broken mapping of Linux security and trusted extended attributes
  into FreeBSD namespace. In particular, essential security.NTACL attribute
  was replaced with the user.NTACL and placed in a insecure USER namespace.

  This port dropped this hack in favor of vfs_freebsd module, which should
  provide more controlled way of such a mapping.

  To maintain the compatibility with the previous installations on UFS2 storage
  (as ZFS uses it's own way of mapping SYSVOL, thanks to the iXsystems patches)
  the vfs_freebsd module provides 'legacy' mode that implements old functionality.

  For the fresh installations it is recommended to use 'secure' mode of operations
  for this module and use it as a global vfs objects.

  Caution: The given module is still considered EXPERIMENTAL.

  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  The port of the new version of Samba 4.10 is introduced. Due necessarily
  to keep backwards compatibility for the legacy samba4[6-8] ports the
  upgrade procedure is a bit convoluted.

  You are safe to perform fresh new install of samba410 port. In case you
  are upgrading from the previous versions of Samba, please use the
  following procedure:

  0.  Take backups of all the relevant files, in particular PREFIX/etc/smb4.conf
      and /var/db/samba4/ subdirectory. Keep in mind that files there (may)
      have extended attributes, so use appropriate tools to preserve them.

  1a. If you haven't updated Samba between 20190619 and 20190630 then next
      step should be as simple as:

        portmaster -o net/samba410 net/samba48

  1b. If you have been affected by the archiving legacy versions of
      Samba-related libraries for legacy versions of Samba, which happened
      in the given time frame, then you need to reverse operation from the
       20190619 entry:

      for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc devel/talloc1
        portmaster -o devel/tevent devel/tevent1
        portmaster -o databases/tdb databases/tdb1
        portmaster -o net/samba410 net/samba48

      for users of portupgrade:
        portupgrade -o devel/talloc devel/talloc1
        portupgrade -o devel/tevent devel/tevent1
        portupgrade -o databases/tdb databases/tdb1
        portupgrade -o net/samba410 net/samba48

20190619:
  AFFECTS: users of samba4[6-8] and devel/talloc, devel/tevent, databases/tdb, databases/ldb*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  To introduce samba410(we deliberately skip samba49 due the complexity of handling)
  and to drop dependency on deprecated Python 2.7, Samba supplementary libraries
  talloc, tevent and tdb were split into current Python 3 compatible versions
  and legacy ones, with the suffix "1".

  Old versions of Samba were changed to depend on the legacy supplementary libraries,
  so if you need to install samba46, samba47 or samba48 over previous Samba
  installations you need to downgrade supplementary libs with the following commands:

  for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portmaster -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portmaster -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb
        portmaster -r talloc1

  for users of portupgrade:
        portupgrade -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portupgrade -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portupgrade -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb
        portupgrade -fr devel/talloc1

20190613:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.12.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20190611:
  AFFECTS: users of net/routinator
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  Release 0.4.0 fundamentally changes the command line options for
  running the server and introduces a new way to initialize the local RPKI
  repository used by Routinator.
  If you have been using previous releases, you will likely have to adjust
  your tooling. We apologize for this, but we also feel that the new commands
  are more intuitive and logical.

20190604:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba47
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of samba has been switched from 4.7 to 4.8.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having samba47 installed indirectly (as a dependency):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having samba47 installed directly (leaf port):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba48

  For ports users:
    If you want to keep samba47, add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.7 to make.conf

    If you want to upgrade to samba48, remove samba47:
    # pkg delete -f samba47

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba48
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba48
    # portupgrade -a

20180601:
  AFFECTS: www/tt-rss
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  tt-rss now uses php intl for extension; a web server reload
  will be required if intl extension isn't already loaded.

20190522:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.0.2, which
  includes more plugins by default, but also requires manual changes to
  graylog's configuration files, possibly port and URL changes, such as
  X-Graylog-Server-URL settings, and elasticsearch must be >= 5.

  The location of configuration files has been amended to align with the
  official distribution files and locations.

  After upgrading, manually review and merge changes from your
  /usr/local/etc/graylog/server/server.conf into
  /usr/local/etc/graylog/graylog.conf

  Consult https://www.graylog.org/post/announcing-graylog-v3-0-ga for
  further details.

20190506:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitea
  AUTHOR: stb@lassitu.de

  Gitea requires the addition of another secret to the config file in order
  to start up.  Either manually add JWT_SECRET to the
  ${PREFIX}/etc/gitea/conf/app.ini config file (see app.ini.sample), or allow
  Gitea to make the change for you by making the config file writable to the
  git user.

20190424:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v12.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. This is a major release, including many significant
  changes. Users are encouraged to read the release announcements before
  upgrading:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.0.0/

20190423:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The directory where all repositories and ssh permissions are stored
  was changed from /usr/home/git back to /usr/local/git, to match again the
  recommended standards on FreeBSD.
  This will cause now some other git management packages to collide with
  gitlab. Make sure you migrate all you git repositories to gitlab first,
  before you continue.

  Make sure /usr/local/git/repositories and /usr/local/git/.ssh are not
  existing!
  Otherwise the next commands can break your installation for managing
  git repositories within gitlab and with your other gitlab management
  software!

  You must move the old files to the new location with:
  # service gitlab stop
  # mv /usr/home/git /usr/local/
  # pkg upg

  Make sure you update your config files, diff shows you what you maybe
  must change:
  # cd /usr/local/www/gitlab-ce
  # git diff config/gitlab.yml.sample config/gitlab.yml
  # cd /usr/local/share/gitlab-shell/
  # git diff config.yml.sample config.yml
  # cd /usr/local/share/gitaly
  # git diff config.toml.sample config.toml

  # Change home directory of user git back to /usr/local/git
  # vipw
  The line should now looks like:
  git:*:211:211::0:0:gitosis user:/usr/local/git:/bin/sh

  If you do an upgrade of gitlab follow the upgrade guide.
  If not, just start gitlab again with:
  # service gitlab start

20190422:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.9 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20190421:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/cego
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  To upgrade from cego 2.39.16 to 2.44.1, you need to export to xml before
  the upgrade and import from xml after the upgrade, because the internal
  storage has changed for some types.

  Use these steps:

  - export your database while it runs, see
    http://www.lemke-it.com/litexec?request=pubcegodoc&user=&lang=en&section=cgdoc_database_running.html#tsimpexp_mode
    for details.
  - stop the database
    service cego stop
  - upgrade the port/package
  - re-create the database
    cego --mode=create --tableset=<database> --dbxml=<database>.xml
  - import the database
    cego --mode=xmlimport --tableset=<database> \
	--dbxml=<database>.xml --impfile=export.xml --doLogging
  - modify /etc/rc.conf by adding
    cego_<database>_cpdump="YES"
    cego_<database>_cleanup="YES"
  - start the database
    service cego start

20190420:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby24
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.4 to 2.5.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.4 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.4 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.4

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby25 lang/ruby24
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.5

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby24:lang/ruby25
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.5.\* -fr lang/ruby25

  These ports' bridge, client, server daemon unintendedly had spit out
  chain_certs (certificate chain) directory on libexec directory until
  r494024.

  If your ${PREFIX}/libexec/softether/chain_certs directory is empty, you
  can remove the directory safely. If the directory is not empty, move it
  to ${SE_DBDIR} when upgrading softether. Following commands should help:

      service softether_(bridge|client|server) stop
      (portmaster, portupgrade or pkg upgrade)
      mv ${PREFIX}/libexec/softether/chain_certs ${SE_DBDIR}/

  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The fluentd port has been upgraded from the 0.12 line to 1.3.3.  The upgrade
  is mostly non-disruptive since there is a backward compatibility with 0.12
  plugins and configuration files, but care should be taken about the order of
  server upgrades since fluentd 1.x is unable to send it's data to version 0.12
  instances.  You should carefully read

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/qgis
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@gwdg.de

  GIS 3.4 LTR, the first long-term release (LTR) of QGIS 3, has landed
  in the FreeBSD ports tree. It will also replace the previous 2.18 LTR
  in the QGIS package repositories in February 2019 [1].

  Beside, the latest Qt4 version 4.8.7 has been EOL since December 2015
  and its expiration date on FreeBSD is set to March, 15th 2019.
  Because QGIS 2 is based on Qt4 and Python2, it was decided to not create
  a legacy port for QGIS 2, after graphics/qgis changed to QGIS 3.

  For users moving over from the 2.18 LTR there is a huge list of new
  features and impactful changes in this new 3.4 LTR version. Most notably
  3.x plugins are incompatible with 2.x plugins, so please review your
  plugin usage carefully. Before moving over, if you have not already
  done so, take a look at the changelogs from versions 3.0, 3.2, and
  3.4 [2][3][4] to understand the full scope of changes in the 3.x release.

  AFFECTS: users of net/GeoIP
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Maxmind no longer provides geolocation data in the legacy format used
  by net/GeoIP. All GEOIP-related OPTIONS have been removed, and all
  GeoIP-dependent ports will be removed soon.

  Where possible, you must switch to net/libmaxminddb, which uses the
  newer (and fully supported) GeoIP 2 format. Unfortunately, this is
  not a drop-in replacement. To fetch the GeoIP 2 geolocation databases,
  whether the free or paid versions, you must use net/geoipupdate
  (pkg install geoipupdate).

  The legacy database is no longer available, and we cannot distribute
  it by the Maxmind license, so the legacy GeoIP format is essentially
  dead.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql-connector-java
  AUTHOR: matthew@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/mysql-connector-java port has been updated to 8.0.13,
  which requires a minimum of Java 1.8, so dropping support for Java
  1.6 and 1.7.  Users of those versions of Java should substitute the
  databases/mysql-connector-java51 port which remains at version
  5.1.47

20190103:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/vlc*

  The multimedia/vlc port has been upgraded to 3.0.5, the latest upstream
  release. Subsequently, multimedia/vlc-qt4 and multimedia/vlc3 have been
  retired and removed from the ports tree. Users who previously used
  multimedia/vlc3 might want to switch to multimedia/vlc with the following
  commands:

  # pkg install multimedia/vlc
    or
  # portmaster -o multimedia/vlc multimedia/vlc3

20181222:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ntopng
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Since ntopng 3.7, for security reasons, the default setting for
  the data directory has been changed to "/var/db/ntopng", and the
  default user has been changed to "ntopng". This new directory is
  created automatically by the port/package with correct permissions.

  In order to maintain backward compatibility, if you are already
  using "/var/tmp/ntopng" as data directory, ntopng keeps using that
  folder, owned by "nobody". This said, using the old defaults is not
  recommended and a manual action is required in order to migrate to
  the new settings, unless you are already using a custom directory:

  # service ntopng stop
  # mv /var/tmp/ntopng/* /var/db/ntopng/
  # chown -R ntopng:ntopng /var/db/ntopng
  # service ntopng start

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.28.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20161103, it should still be the same.

  AFFECTS: users of news/inn when upgrading to FreeBSD 12
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading from FreeBSD 11 to 12, a change in the size of the
  ino_t type causes a binary incompatibility in the overview database
  if the default tradindexed format is used.

  After upgrading the inn package, remove the overview/group.index
  file and regenerate the history and overview database with
  makehistory(8) before starting innd.

  # echo '. /usr/local/news/lib/innshellvars && \
        rm -f $OVERVIEWDIR/group.index && \

  AFFECTS: users of DRM ports other than graphics/drm-kmod
  AUTHOR: jmd@FreeBSD.org

  In order to facilitate future porting efforts and help in supporting multiple
  FreeBSD versions, the DRM ports other than drm-kmod (graphics/drm-stable-kmod,
  graphics/drm-next-kmod, graphics/drm-devel-kmod) have been renamed to
  include the FreeBSD version they are designed for.

  drm-stable-kmod is drm-fbsd11.2-kmod
  drm-next-kmod is drm-fbsd12.0-kmod
  drm-devel-kmod is drm-current-kmod

20181209
  AFFECTS: users of devel/geany and devel/geany-plugins
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Geany and its plugins port have been moved to gtk3 and a new gtk2
  flavor has been added. The gtk2 flavor has a -gtk2 suffix added to the
  package name.

  If you want to stay with the gtk2 version you need to use "pkg install"
  to install the new gtk2 flavor, pkg will automatically deinstall the
  gtk3 flavors.

  If using port, to maintain the gtk2 version, you will need to deinstall
  geany and its plugins and reinstall specifying the gtk2 flavor.

  Note that the following plugins are not available if using the new
  gtk3 flavor:

  * geany-plugin-debugger
  * geany-plugin-devhelp
  * geany-plugin-geanypy
  * geany-plugin-multiterm
  * geany-plugin-scope

  If you upgrade from a previous version, make a backup of
       /var/db/openhab2
  and run
       %%PREFIX%%/libexec/openhab2/runtime/bin/update.freebsd

  Config specific info (changes from 2.2.0 to 2.3.0):
  Nest Binding: The 'camera' Thing Type now has channel groups.
                Add 'camera#' before the channel ID in the channel UID of
                existing camera channels. The 'time_to_target_mins' channel
                of the 'thermostat' Thing Type is renamed to 'time_to_target'
  Oceanic Binding: The 'softener' Thing Type no longer exists and is replaced
                   by the 'serial' and 'ethernet' Thing Types
  Yamaha Receiver Binding: The configuration parameter names now use lower
                           camel case convention. Change 'HOST' to 'host',
                           'PORT' to 'port' etc

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/munin-master, sysutils/munin-node, www/owncloud, mail/mailman, net/ntpa
  AUTHOR: woodsb02@FreeBSD.org

  The newsyslog.conf(5) filename installed by the port has been changed:
  OLD: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/${PORTNAME}
  NEW: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/${PORTNAME}.conf

  Any file found at the old location will be automatically moved to the new
  location. This will ensure log rotation will continue to work after change
  r340318 to FreeBSD base, where the default newsyslog configuration now only
  includes filenames that end with '.conf' and do not begin with '.'.

  If you use provisioning/configuration management tools to create or edit this
  file, you will need to change their configuration to use the new filename.

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/mesa-libs
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  Wayland support has been enabled in ports where it doesn't exclude
  X11 support in order to make the binary packages usable with Wayland
  compositors. If you get strange build failures re-run "make config"
  to pick up the new defaults. If the extra dependencies are not
  desired add the following to make.conf:

    OPTIONS_UNSET += WAYLAND

  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v11.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node10, has been created for the
  v10.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v10.x can replace www/node
  with www/node8 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node10

  AFFECTS: users of lang/php71
  AUTHOR: joneum@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.1 to 7.2.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php71 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php72.

20181020:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.8 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20181018:
  AFFECTS: users of security/hitch

  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap and other courier ports
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Courier-IMAP 5.0.0 added IMAP UTF8 support, and converted maildir
  folders' names to Unicode.

  Updating an existing system to Courier-IMAP 5.0, and later,
  requires a manual one-time conversion of all existing maildirs
  using the maildirmake command. See the maildirmake(1) manual page
  for more information.

  All other courier ports accessing maildirs also need to be updated
  at the same time.

20181009:

  metaport from now on, which will select a recommended DRM version based on
  the FreeBSD version.

20180924:
  AFFECTS: www/libresonic-standalone
  AUTHOR: jlh@FreeBSD.org

  HTTPS support has been removed from the port, as it will be removed upstream:
    https://github.com/Libresonic/libresonic/issues/125#issuecomment-256227104

  In order to avoid strange behavior for users who are using this feature, the
  rc.d script will fail fast if libresonic_ssl="YES". You should remove the
  following variables from rc.conf(5): libresonic_ssl libresonic_ssl_keystore
  libresonic_ssl_password.

  # sed -i '' /libresonic_ssl/d /etc/rc.conf

  Users needing SSL are encouraged to use an HTTP reverse-proxy. Example
  configurations can be found here:

20180922:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/ilmbase, graphics/OpenEXR
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The IlmBase package has been updated to 2.3.0.
  The OpenEXR package has been renamed to openexr and updated to 2.3.0.

  The PORTREVISION of all ports requiring either has been bumped to
  ease the rebuilds, and where there were versions in the file names,
  these have been removed from the *_DEPENDS lines for easier maintenance.

  A full ports or package upgrade should just work.

  If you are doing partial updates, be sure to rebuild and reinstall
  all packages that require either of OpenEXR or ilmbase.
  Normally, these can be listed by running:

  # pkg info -q -r OpenEXR ilmbase  | sort -u | xargs pkg info -q -o

  # pkg info php5\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php56 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php71.

  AFFECTS: net/samba48
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba ports from now on are not dependent from the databases/ldb* ports,
  as the link between Samba and LDB is too tight and each next major Samba

  AFFECTS: net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  As of version 1.42, to conform with man hier, logs and rrd files have
  relocated outside the WWW directory. When upgrading from < 1.42 to more
  recent versions, the following steps are required.

  You must update config.php and manually relocate the rrd and log files.
  Before upgrading, please stop librenms,  update the configuration, and
  relocate the files.

  If you find graphs are not updating, fping >= 4.0 requires an IPv6
  address. Adding an IPv6 address should fix graphing.

  Please add these entries to config.php:

  $config['installed_from_package'] = true;
  $config['log_dir'] = '/var/log/librenms';
  $config['rrd_dir'] = '/var/db/librenms/rrd';

  To relocate the files:

  mkdir /var/log/librenms /var/db/librenms
  chown www:ww: /var/log/librenms /var/db/librenms
  cd /usr/local/www/librenms
  mv rrd /var/db/librenms/
  mv logs/librenms.log /var/log/librenms/
  rmdir logs

  An application key is required. Please follow these steps to generate it:

  cd /usr/local/www/librenms
  cp -i .env.sample .env

  You might need to set your database details in that file.
  Then run:

  php artisan key:generate

  The output should look something like this:

  **************************************
  *     Application In Production!     *
  **************************************

   Do you really wish to run this command? (yes/no) [no]:
   > y

  AFFECTS: databases/postgresql??-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL server packages are no longer built with support for the XML
  datatype per default. To retain support for the XML datatype you should build

20180731:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg and all ports with USE_XORG=*proto
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The xorg *proto packages have all been merged into one package,
  x11/xorgproto.  This might cause issues with upgrading.  If you
  get conflicts between xorgproto and old *proto packages, please
  remove the old package and install xorgproto again.

  In order to remove all orphaned ports, including all *proto port,

  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnsdist
  AUTHOR: cpm@FreeBSD.org

  After discussing with several users, we noticed that quite a lot of them
  were not aware that enabling the dnsdist's console without a key, even
  restricted to the local host, could be a security issue and allow privilege
  escalation by allowing an unprivileged user to connect to the console and
  execute Lua code as the dnsdist user. We therefore decided to refuse any
  connection to the console until a key has been set, so please check that
  you do set a key before upgrading if you use the console.

20180704:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The gitlab port uses the package from gitlab.org instead of github.org.
  For this the port was renamed from gitlab to gitlab-ce.
  Please follow the instructions very carefully to not lose your data!
  Not only the package was renamed, also the directory name changed.

  You can find the current instruction here:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/10.8-11.0-freebsd.md

  Please note the update was only tested for an update from 10.8.5 to 11.0.2.
  If your version of gitlab was released before 2014-03-13 you cannot update

20180612:
  AFFECTS: users of the nox flavor of editors/emacs-devel
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  The package name for the nox flavor of editors/emacs-devel changed from
  emacs-devel_nox to emacs-devel-nox.  To install the new package, run

  # pkg install emacs-devel-nox

  pkg should remove the old and install the new package.

20180612:
  AFFECTS: users of packages that depend on Emacs
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  With the release of Emacs version 26.1, the major version of editors/emacs
  changed from 25 to 26, so the names of packages that depend on Emacs have also
  changed.  For example, pdf-tools-emacs25-0.80.79_1 is now called
  pdf-tools-emacs26-0.80.79_1.  The name change means simply running `pkg
  upgrade` will not upgrade foo-emacs25-x to foo-emacs26-x.

  To list the packages to upgrade, use

  # pkg info \*emacs25\*

  then install the new version for each with

  # pkg install foo-emacs26

  pkg should remove the old and install the new packages.

20180611:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP based applications
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Flavors are being added to PHP applications.  When a port is flavorized, pkg
  needs to be told about the name change, for example, if PHP 5.6 is the one
  you need:

  # pkg set -n squirrelmail:squirrelmail-php56

  Most port will have packages for all PHP versions present in the ports tree,
  but some may not be compatible with a specific version.

  To get the available flavors, pkg rquery can be used:

  # pkg rquery %n mail/squirrelmail
  squirrelmail-php56
  squirrelmail-php70
  squirrelmail-php71
  squirrelmail-php72

20180602:
  AFFECTS: users of net/frr

20180529:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/ibus-typing-booster
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  Attention, this release merges all engines into one. Therefore, the
  engine names had to change. The old engine names like "German - DE
  (Typing Booster)", "Hindi - HI (Typing Booster)" don't exist anymore!
  If one has entries for them in the Gnome Control Center or in
  ibus-setup, one needs to remove these old entries and add the new
  engine name "Other (Typing Booster)".

  In particular, Node.js now depends on OpenSSL 1.1.0h, so the
  BUNDLED_SSL option is enabled by default. Users can disable this
  option when using security/openssl-devel as their default SSL library.

  AFFECTS: users of news/nntp
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The option INETD was removed. If you used inetd, please change the path
  in /etc/inetd.conf from /usr/local/sbin/nntpd to /usr/local/libexec/nntpd.

20180428:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.7 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20180427:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zrepl
  AUTHOR: woodsb02@FreeBSD.org

  The zrepl update to 0.0.3 includes the following breaking changes:
  - Snapshots are automatically bookmarked and pruning of bookmarks must
    be configured by adding the keep_bookmarks parameter to the prune
    policy section of the zrepl configuration file (source side only).
    Be sure to understand the meaning bookmarks have for maximum
    allowable replication downtime.
  - The ssh+stdinserver transport protocol has changed, requiring zrepl
    to be updates on both the sending and receiving side, and the daemon
    restarted on both sides.
  - The first outlet in the global.logging section of the configuration
    file is now used for logging meta-errors (e.g. problems encountered
    when writing to other logging outlets).

20180425:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/pecl-redis
  AUTHOR: daniel@blodan.se

  pecl-redis 4.0.0 breaks backwards compatibility, users
  not aware if you are using the changed functionality or not
  should swap to databases/pecl-redis3

20180417:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnscrypt-proxy2
  AUTHOR: egypcio@googlemail.com

  DNSCrypt-Proxy 2 has been updated to 2.0.10 and the configuration file
  has changed from ${PREFIX}/etc/dnscrypt-proxy.toml to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-proxy.toml.

20180416:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postgrey
  AUTHOR: ports.maintainer@evilphi.com

  If you use any of the optional make.conf variables to specify the
  postgrey user, group, db dir, or run dir when building the port, you will
  need to change the prefix from PG_ to POSTGREY_*.  The variables were
  renamed to solve a namespace collision with the PostgreSQL ports.

20180412:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/php-composer
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Flavors have been added to the composer port with the update to
  1.6.3. Due to the change in PKGNAME pkg(and other tools) will not
  notice the update. It is required to tell pkg about the name
  change, for example:

  # pkg set -n php-composer:php56-composer

20180410:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Most of KDE Applications 17.12.3 have now landed in the ports tree.
  There are still some missing pieces, that will follow soon.

  As mentioned in the commit messages, users of KDE SC4 should stick with the
  <foo>-kde4 named package.

  As the MOVED entries for ports like databases/akonadi-kde4 have been removed
  in the process of updating (as there now is again a databases/akonad), there
  might be issues for people that update from a too old installed package list
  with portmaster.

  These should be fixable by issuing a command à la
  # pkg set --change-origin databases/akonadi:databases/akonadi-kde4 akonadi

20180409:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/matterircd
  AUTHOR: norrland@nullbyte.se

  Matterircd has been updated to 0.17.0 and mattermost configuration settings
  need to be migrated to [mattermost] section. See matterircd.toml.sample.

20180404:
  AFFECTS: users of www/nextcloud
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  With the 13.0.1 update the path for Apps bundled with the package has
  changed from "apps" to "apps-pkg". You must add an entry to the
  "apps_paths" array in config/config.php of your nextcloud installation,
  a patch for the default installation can be applied with:

  # cd /usr/local/www/nextcloud
  # su -m www -c "php ./occ config:import < /usr/local/share/nextcloud/fix-apps_paths.json"

20180401:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot and mail/dovecot-pigeonhole
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Dovecot has been upgraded to 2.3.1, and pigeonhole to 0.5.1. Most
  existing dovecot installations MUST be modified for 2.3, but for
  most users the modifications are simple.

  Modify your Dovecot conf.d/ files before spinning up 2.3.1. The
  upgrading instructions are detailed here:

  	https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Upgrading/2.3

20180330:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.26.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20161103, it should still be the same.

20180325:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba48
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  New Samba 4.8 upgrades the relevant database files in the way, that doesn't
  allow easy fallback to the previous versions of Samba. So, before upgrading
  to the new version make a backup of the /var/db/samba4/ directory.

  Full list of changes, new features and upgrade procedure is available at:

        https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.8.0.html

  Please, read it carefully before upgrading!.

20180320:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/sterm
  AUTHOR: pkubaj@anongoth.pl

  The user-defined options in config.h have changed.  You should
  compare your config.h file with the default one and change
  appropriately.

20180319:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnsmasq
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Note that with dnsmasq 2.79, some parts of the interface have changed in an
  incompatible way versus previous versions. This comprises changed recursion
  behaviour, signature support, a change for SIGINT (vs. SIGHUP) behaviour.

  Note especially that dnsmasq will no longer answer non-recursive queries
  unless it is marked authoritative!  Be sure to see the manual page for the
  various --auth-* options, such as --auth-zone.

  Please see the CHANGELOG that ships with dnsmasq for details.

20180317:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/plexpy
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Plexpy project has been renamed to Tautulli due to copyright
  infringement. The software also has received a major update. Please
  see the following upgrade instructions:

  - Install multimedia/tautulli
  - Create /var/db/tautulli, owned by the user you will run the daemon as
    (default: nobody).
  - Copy your config.ini and plexpy.db to /var/db/tautulli
  - Enable the service and start the software

   Tautulli should automatically find your database file, rename it to
   tautulli.db, and perform the required updates.

20180310:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The EXPCIPHERS option has been removed from the security/openssl port.
  Use the security/openssl-unsafe port if you require this feature.

20180309:
  AFFECTS: users of net/unison
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.51, which uses a different
  wire protocol than 2.48 did.  In order to support synchronization
  with other computers where Unison is still at version 2.48, a new
  port net/unison248 has been created.  It provides unison248 and,
  for the x11 flavor, also unison248-text.  This unison248 port can
  be installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

20180308:
  AFFECTS: */php* */pecl* */pear*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  PHP extensions and modules have been flavored.

  People using Poudriere 3.2+ and binary packages do not have to do anything if
  they are using PHP applications.

  PHP modules and extensions may have change their names from php5- or php7- to
  fully versionned phpXY-.
  PECL extensions and PEAR modules package names have changed from pecl- and
  pear- to phpXX-pecl and phpXX-pear-.

  To rename an installed package to match the new naming scheme, for example,
  for the imagick pecl extension, run:

    # pkg set -n pecl-imagick:php56-pecl-imagick

  For other people, to build the PHP 7.2 version of, for example,
  databases/php-memcached, you need to run:

    # make FLAVOR=php72 install

20180220:
  AFFECTS: users of www/nextcloud
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The file and directory permissions of Nextcloud have changed. Write
  permissions have been removed from all directories except `data' and
  `config'. For the updater to work, the app store of your installation
  must be disabled. To disable the app-store prior to updating the
  package:

  # cd /usr/local/www/nextcloud
  # su -m www -c "php ./occ config:system:set appstoreenabled --value=false --type=boolean"

  If you've already updated your nextcloud package, you must manually edit
  the configuration of nextcloud (config/config.php) and add

  	'appstoreenabled' => false,

  to the CONFIG array before the updater will run.

20180214:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby23
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.3 to 2.4.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.3 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.3 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.3

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby24 lang/ruby23
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.4

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby23:lang/ruby24
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.4.\* -fr lang/ruby24

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/pmacct
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  To allow separate pmacctd instances per interface, use

    pmacctd_enable="YES"
    pmacctd_interfaces="re1 re2"

  in /etc/rc.conf. The path to the config files will be

    /usr/local/etc/pmacct/<interface>

20180208:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailman*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  In order to overcome complaints about mismatched checksums in
  Mailman/Default.py, mailman now configures the DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST
  and DEFAULT_URL_HOST to "localhost" statically, and the rc script
  will check this and refuse to start on next boot.

  Users must configure DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST and DEFAULT_URL_HOST in
  Mailman/mm_cfg.py properly and add this line below:
  add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)

  A short example has been added to:
  ${PREFIX}/local/share/doc/mailman/FreeBSD-post-install-notes.

  As of 2.1.26_3, the post-install script will add back the prior
  default settings to mm_cfg.py (instead of Defaults.py) if no
  virtual hosts have been defined, to cover the normal use cases
  and initial installation.

20180201:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs* and all ports using Emacs via USES=emacs
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  The Emacs ports framework has been updated to support flavors and the
  editors/emacs-nox11 port has been replaced by the nox flavors of
  editors/emacs and editors/emacs-devel.

  Supported Flavors
  --------------------------------------------------------
  editors/emacs:       full canna nox
  editors/emacs-devel: full nox
  ports using Emacs:   full canna nox devel_full devel_nox
  --------------------------------------------------------

  For those using pre-built packages, if

     # pkg upgrade

  does not install the new Emacs package, use one of

     # pkg install emacs
     # pkg install emacs-canna
     # pkg install emacs-nox
     # pkg install emacs-devel
     # pkg install emacs-devel-nox

  For those building their own packages, a flavor other than the default must be
  specified.  For example, to build the nox flavor of editors/emacs, or to build
  the devel_full flavor of a port using Emacs, use

     # poudriere bulk -j 11amd64 editors/emacs@nox
     # poudriere bulk -j 11amd64 print/pdf-tools@devel_full

  or

     # make FLAVOR=nox install
     # make FLAVOR=devel_full

  An alternative to the default flavor, full, for editors/emacs and
  editors/emacs-devel can be set in make.conf.  For example, to specify nox as
  the default flavor for both ports, use

     .if ${.CURDIR:M*/editors/emacs*}
     FLAVOR?=nox
     .endif

  For ports using Emacs, an alternative to the default flavor, full,
  can be also be set in make.conf.  For example, to automatically depend on
  emacs-nox, use

     DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=emacs=nox

20180117:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/kf5-kirigami2 and x11/kf5-plasma-framework
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Files that were previously installed by kf5-kirigami2 are now installed
  by kf5-plasma-framework. This can lead to a conflict during the upgrade
  of the packages.
  It is recommended to first remove the package kf5-kirigami2.

20180115:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission-daemon
  AUTHOR: woodsb02@FreeBSD.org

  The transmission-daemon port has been updated to 2.92_4 to incorporate
  a patch which mitigates DNS rebinding attacks. This will prevent
  clients from being able to connect to the transmission daemon using
  DNS with any hostname other than localhost, unless one of the
  following is done:
    - Enable password authentication, then any hostname is allowed.
      This can be achieved by either:
        - setting rpc-authentication-required to true, and adding
          credentials to the rpc-username and rpc-password fields in
          settings.json (must be done whilst the transmission service is
          stopped); or
        - running transmission-daemon with the following arguments
          (these can be set with transmission_flags in /etc/rc.conf):
          -t -u USERNAME -v PASSWORD
    OR
    - Add the allowed server hostnames to the rpc-host-whitelist setting
      in settings.json (must be done whilst the transmission service is
      stopped). Note that this value is NOT a list of allowed CLIENTS,
      but instead a list of allowed SERVER hostnames.

20180111:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim-lite
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The vim-lite port has been renamed to vim-console, because it isn't
  actually any lighter. All three vim packages are built with
  --enable-features=huge. Portmaster users will need to run this
  command:

  	portmaster -o editors/vim-console editors/vim-lite

  If the switch doesn't happen automatically for you, just delete the
  vim-lite package and install vim-console.

20180109:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The upgrade of www/qt5-webengine to 5.9.3 may fail if an older version
  of it is installed. It is recommended to either build the port in a
  builder like poudriere, or to deinstall and then doing an install.

20180107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnupg and mail/mutt and mail/neomutt
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The invocation for gpg from mutt/neomutt changed between gnupg-2.0
  (which has expired and is now removed) and gnupg-2.2 (the current
  version in the tree). Unless you're using gpgme, PGP-related
  commands may fail in (neo)mutt.

  In all cases, users are strongly urged to use security/gpgme to take
  care of the setup for you. If you prefer to roll your own, the
  following muttrc/neomuttrc entry has been reported to work:

  pgp_decrypt_command="gpg2 %?p?--passphrase-fd 0 --pinentry-mode=loopback? --no-verbose --batch --output - %f"

  See muttrc(5), neomuttrc(5), mutt.org, and neomutt.org for instructions
  on (neo)mutt's gpg and gpgme instructions.

20180102:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/awscli
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The package name for devel/awscli has changed (back) to just awscli.
  The introduction of flavors erroneously caused the awscli package to
  be renamed to py27-awscli.

20171230:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  If you are building ejabberd 17.11 on a host, which already has an older
  version of ejabberd installed, then build process will fail with "unknown type
  specifier" errors. As a workaround, please uninstall ejabberd before building
  ejabberd.

  This has been reported upstream at:
  https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/2194

20171223:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/dnscrypt-proxy
  AUTHOR: egypcio@googlemail.com

  The 1.9.5_3 update of dns/dnscrypt-proxy replaces the default resolver used
  by dnscrypt-proxy (cisco/OpenDNS) by a random one that does not log entries
  and supports dnssec.

20171223:
  AFFECTS: users of samba44
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of samba has been switched from 4.4 to 4.6.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having samba44 installed indirectly (as a dependency):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having samba44 installed directly (leaf port):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba46

  For ports users:
    If you want to keep samba44, add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.4 to make.conf

    If you want to upgrade to samba46, remove samba44:
    # pkg delete -f samba44

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba46
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba46
    # portupgrade -a

20171218:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gogs
  AUTHOR: dg@syrec.org

  Gogs user has been changed to "git" and configuration files are now
  located in /usr/local/etc/gogs. Users should update ownership of the
  existing Gogs directories with

  # chown -R git:git /var/db/gogs
  # chown -R git:git /var/log/gogs

  and either move or merge the contents of /var/db/gogs/home/.ssh with
  /usr/local/git/.ssh.  After migration, /var/db/gogs/home can be removed,
  and both the user "gogs" and the group "gogs" should be deleted:

  # rm -rf /var/db/gogs/home
  # pw userdel gogs
  # pw groupdel gogs

20171215:
  AFFECTS: users of finance/gnucash
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The gnucash port has been converted too use flavors, the GUILE1
  and GUILE2 options have been converted to flavors so that two
  separate packages can be provided.

  Since the next major release of gnucash will drop guile1 support,
  the default flavor package is compiled against guile2, switching
  the previous default.

  Users who intend to stay on the guile1 version should deinstall
  the default gnucash package and install the gnucash-guile1 package.

20171214:
  AFFECTS: all ports users
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Support for some deprecated variables is going to be removed soon. If
  you use any of the following constructs (usually in /etc/make.conf),
  you must switch to the new incantations:

20171205:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/powerdns
  AUTHOR: krion@FreeBSD.org

  Recursor passthrough removal: This will impact many installations.
  Previously, the PowerDNS Authoritative Server contained a facility
  for sending recursion desired queries to a resolving backend,
  possibly after first consulting its local cache. This feature
  (‘recursor=’) was frequently confusing and also delivered
  inconsistent results, for example when a query ended up referring
  to a CNAME that was outside of the Authoritative Server’s
  knowledge.

20171203:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/dsbmd
  AUTHOR: mk@freeshell.de

  Due to new configuration variables and new features, users of dsbmd
  version 0.4.1 and earlier should consider recreating their dsbmd.conf from
  the new dsbmd.conf.sample.

20171130:
  AFFECTS: all ports users
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The ports tree has gained "flavors," which are a way to produce multiple
  variations of a port. Some intended examples of this are language
  modules being produced for multiple language versions, and lite/nox11 packages,
  without needing separate ports for each variation. Python ports have already
  been flavored (see the below entry). Flavor support must be added to
  individual ports.

  Flavors are already supported by make, pkg, poudriere, and synth; see the
  manpages for those tools for usage instructions. Portmaster and portupgrade
  don't support flavors yet, but community work on those tools is in progress.

  Some bumps and breakages are inevitable for a major change such as this.
  Please report breakages and monitor the ports@ list for solutions as they
  become available.

20171130:
  AFFECTS: */py*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Ports using Python via USES=python are now flavored.  All the py3-* ports
  have been removed and folded into their py-* master ports.

  People using Poudriere 3.2+ and binary packages do not have to do anything.

  For other people, to build the Python 3.6 version of, for example,
  databases/py-gdbm, you need to run:

    # make FLAVOR=py36 install

20171114:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/poudriere
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  "poudriere options" now respects the -p flag while it did not before.
  This means that it may create an empty directory when used now rather
  than continue to use your existing options set.  You may want to not
  use -p or move your existing options directory, in
  /usr/local/etc/poudriere.d/*-options, to the new format with the
  ports tree name in it.  Otherwise "poudriere bulk" will use the
  new empty directory.

  This behavior will likely change in 3.2.1 to be more backwards-compatible.

  AFFECTS: consumers of devel/oniguruma*
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  Outdated versions of oniguruma have been removed from the ports
  tree; devel/oniguruma is the only supported version, currently
  replacing devel/oniguruma6.
  pkg should handle this automatically while users of portmaster or
  portupgrade might need to take additional manual steps:

  for users of portmaster:
	portmaster -o devel/oniguruma devel/oniguruma6
	portmaster -r devel/oniguruma

  for users of portupgrade:
	portupgrade -o devel/oniguruma devel/oniguruma6
	portupgrade -fr devel/oniguruma

20171107:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to node.js v9.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node8, has been created for the
  v8.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v8.x can replace www/node
  with www/node8 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node8
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node8 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node8 www/node

20171107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.6 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20171105:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_auth_cas
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The configuration of mod_auth_cas has changed since the previous

  an overview of all configuration parameters

20171105:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_rpaf2
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The configuration of mod_rpaf2 has been heavily modified since version
  0.6. Have a look at https://github.com/gnif/mod_rpaf/tree/v0.8.4 to
  determine what you need to change in your configuration.

20171031:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The default vim language bindings have changed. Python 2 and 3 bindings
  may now be enabled independently (the default vim package will continue
  to depend on python-2.7).

  Lua and Tcl bindings have been disabled by default. If you need these
  bindings, you'll need to compile vim yourself. Note that bindings are
  only for plugins written in those languages, and for interactive
  debugging. Editing, indenting, linting, completing, and syntax-highlighting
  those languages is NOT affected.

20171026:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/universal-ctags
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  Due to conflicts with emacs ctag (editors/emacs-devel, editors/emacs-nox11, editors/emacs),
  the installed files will be prefixed with the 'u' character.
  The new binaries will de named uctags and ureadtags.

20171015:
  AFFECTS: people using WITHOUT_DEBUG
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The WITHOUT_DEBUG flag has been retired. It's only purpose was
  to override a global WITH_DEBUG, if that was defined, but many
  ports were ignoring such flag even if honouring WITH_DEBUG.

  The same effect can be obtained using ".undef WITH_DEBUG" without
  any special support in port Makefiles.

20171012:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH has been upgraded to 7.6p1 which has removed several deprecated
  features:

    - SSH version 1 support dropped.
    - Dropped support for hmac-ripemd160 MAC.
    - Dropped support for the ciphers arcfour, blowfish and CAST.
    - RSA keys less than 1024 bits are refused.

  The HPN option is currently disabled by default, and does not build,
  in the package.  This follows what happened in base as well.

20171004:
  AFFECTS: users of security/krb5-appl
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  Configuration options to rename kerberos ftp, telnet, rlogin, rsh, and
  rcp are now default to avoid conflicting with net/bsdrcmds packages
  (in poudriere). Deselect the options to use the original command names
  and also uninstall net/bsdrcmds to avoid the conflict.

20171002:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/cwm
  AUTHOR: tobik@FreeBSD.org

  Configuration options were renamed and you need to update your ~/.cwmrc
  accordingly.  Make sure to check cwmrc(5) for the new option names.
  cwm-migrate-config.pl can help in migrating your ~/.cwmrc.

20171001:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/isync using Maildir sub-folders
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  If you have Maildir sub-folders, you need to update the configuration
  to specify the naming style.

  Please refer to the mbsync(1) man page section 'SubFolders
  Verbatim|Maildir++|Legacy' on how to make the apropriate changes.

20170930:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP and its modules
  AUTHOR: eugen@FreeBSD.org

  All lang/php* ports switched to depend on devel/oniguruma6
  instead of previous oniguruma version some time ago.

  If you have not moved from devel/oniguruma5 before and
  have troubles updating PHP,

  for users of portmaster:
	portmaster -o devel/oniguruma6 devel/oniguruma5
	portmaster -r devel/oniguruma6

  for users of portupgrade:
	portupgrade -o devel/oniguruma6 devel/oniguruma5
	portupgrade -fr devel/oniguruma6

  pkg should handle this automatically.

20170928:
  AFFECTS: users of security/courier-authlib and its modules
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The affected ports have been modified to follow the upstream
  suggested best practice to use the sysconftool on installation.

  Please make sure your configuration files include all the comments
  that tool uses to correctly update the configuration on update.

  You can use the ".sample" or ".dist" files as templates for missing
  comments if needed.

20170915:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/cargo
  AUTHOR: rust@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with version 1.19.0, Cargo is provided with Rust. Therefore,
  devel/cargo was merged into lang/rust.

20170914:
  AFFECTS: users of CMake & CMake Modules
  AUTHOR: adridg@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/cmake-modules port has been merged into devel/cmake.

  The benefit of being able to update the modules without the binary
  is outweighed by the issues caused by having the binary out-of-sync
  with the modules.

  Users should delete the devel/cmake-modules package and then
  upgrade or reinstall devel/cmake.

  All ports have been updated to depend only on CMake.

20170808:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  8.0.2.  Hence it is recommended to rebuild or reinstall all the
  dependent ports and the lang/ghc port itself in one of the following
  ways:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  In case of pkg(8), it is probably safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.  For
  example:

  # pkg query "%ro" ghc > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc

  In ghc-pkgs.txt, check and remove all the packages that have been moved
  on the update, then use this command:

  # pkg install -y `cat ghc-pkgs.txt`

20170807:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot2 and mail/dovecot2-pigeonhole
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Now that dovecot1 has been removed from the ports tree, dovecot2
  and dovecot2-pigeonhole have been renamed to simply dovecot and
  dovecot-pigeonhole.

  pkg should handle the rename automatically, but if you run into
  trouble, you can point pkg at the new origin via:

  # pkg set -o mail/dovecot2:mail/dovecot
  # pkg set -o mail/dovecot2-pigeonhole:mail/dovecot-pigeonhole

  Similarly, you can point portmaster at the new location via:

  # portmaster -o mail/dovecot mail/dovecot2

  If all else fails, just remove and reinstall the package:

  # pkg delete dovecot2
  # pkg install dovecot

20170806:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot2-antispam-plugin
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Development of the antispam plugin ceased years ago, and upstream

  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr1
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  APR was updated to 1.6.0 and APR-util was updated to 1.6.2

  The Apache Portable Runtime project removed support for FreeTDS from the
  APR Utilities in version 1.6. Users of FreeTDS will have to migrate
  configurations to use the newly added ODBC support in conjunction with
  FreeTDS using FreeTDS' ODBC capabilities.

  Please rebuild all ports which are using functions from APR/APR-util
  such as Apache, Subversion, etc. Normally, you can obtain the list of
  dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r apr

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on APR(-util) to avoid
  dangling shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this
  correctly, portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to
  rebuild all dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:

  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  The rabbitmq-3.6.10_1 port has been changed to use version 19 of
  the Erlang runtime, because RabbitMQ is not yet compatible with
  version 20.

  Upgrades to the previous rabbitmq-3.6.10 must be avoided as
  they can lead to data corruption due to changes in Erlang 20.

20170622:
  AFFECTS: users of database/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 9.3 to 9.5.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 9.3.12, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql93-server postgresql93-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql93-server-9.3.17.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql93-contrib-9.3.17.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # mv /usr/local/pgsql/data /usr/local/pgsql/data93
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql93-server databases/postgresql93-contrib databases/postgresql93-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # service postgresql initdb
  # su -l pgsql -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /usr/local/pgsql/data93/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /usr/local/pgsql/data/"

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  AFFECTS: users of editors/calligra
  AUTHOR: groot@kde.org

  Calligra has been updated to 3.0.1, which is a KDE Frameworks 5 (KF5)
  based application. Calligra now uses Qt5 and KF5. The translations have
  been merged (upstream) into the application, so separate language /
  translation ports are no longer provided. Krita has been split out
  (upstream) into a separate application, which is packaged as
  graphics/krita. Kexi, the visual database applications creator,
  is packaged separately as databases/kexi.

  Users of Calligra are encouraged to install Krita and Kexi separately,
  and to report issues with the upgrade to kde@.

20170602:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 5 in presence of binutils
  AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  gold linker from binutils 2.28 may produce duplicate library
  symbols, which makes shared libraries created with it not usable
  with conventional ld linker.

  This affects Qt, as qt5-qmake will detect gold and use it to build
  Qt libraries. Broken libQt5Core will be produced and ports which
  depend on it will then fail to link with the following errors:

    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): multiple definition of `__bss_start at Qt_5'
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): first defined here
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): multiple definition of `_edata at Qt_5'
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x27ac8): first defined here
    ...lib/libQt5Core.so:(.dynamic+0x2b2d0): multiple definition of `_end at Qt_5'

  Qt5 was fixed to ignore gold. If you see these errors, you
  need to rebuild qt5-qmake, then all qt5-* ports.

20170529:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/dsbmd
  AUTHOR: mk@freeshell.de

  Due to new configuration variables and semantic changes, users of dsbmd

20170518:
  AFFECTS: users of www/yarn
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The default node backend for yarn has switched to www/node. Binary

  AFFECTS: net/samba44, net/samba45, net/samba46 and devel/p5-Parse-Pidl*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  It turned out that arbitary versions of p5-Parse-Pidl may lead to the
  hard to explain crashes of the Samba server and utilities(in particular
  we suspect it was responsible for the troubles with the DC provisioning).

  So, from now on net/samba* ports use bundled version of Pidl. You need to
  remove external package from the system:

  pkg delete -f p5-Parse-Pidl p5-Parse-Pidl44

  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  The format of several log messages emitted by the packet code has
  changed to include additional information about the user and
  their authentication state. Software that monitors ssh/sshd logs
  may need to account for these changes. For example:

  Connection closed by user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
  Connection closed by authenticating user x 10.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
  Connection closed by invalid user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]

  Affected messages include connection closure, timeout, remote
  disconnection, negotiation failure and some other fatal messages
  generated by the packet code.

20170326:
  AFFECTS: users of samba43
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of samba has been switched from 4.3 to 4.4.
  Upgrade instructions:

  For package users having samba43 installed indirectly (as a dependency):
    # pkg upgrade

  For package users having samba43 installed directly (leaf port):
    # pkg upgrade
    # pkg install samba44

  For ports users:
    If you want to keep samba43, add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= samba=4.3 to make.conf

    If you want to upgrade to samba44, remove samba43 and obsolete packages:
    # pkg delete -f samba36-libsmbclient samba36-nmblookup samba36-smbclient samba36 samba43 p5-Parse-Pidl

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster net/samba44

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall net/samba44
    # portupgrade -a

20170325:
  AFFECTS: net/samba46 and devel/p5-Parse-Pidl
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  New version of Samba port from 4.6 branch is added. Before upgrading please read upgrade notes:

  https://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-4.6.0.html

  For the vfs_fruit users:

  Users on *BSD must rename the metadata xattr used by vfs_fruit when
  using the default setting "fruit:metadata = netatalk".

  Due to a glitch in the Samba xattr API compatibility layer for FreeBSD and a
  mistake in vfs_fruit, vfs_fruit ended up using the wrong xattr name when
  configured with "fruit:metadata = netatalk" (default). Instead of the correct

  org.netatalk.Metadata

  it used

  netatalk.Metadata

  Starting with Samba 4.6 vfs_fruit will use the correct "org.netatalk.Metadata"
  which means existing installations must rename this xattrs. For this purpose
  Samba now includes a new tool `mvxattr`.

20170316:
  AFFECTS: users of python setuptools
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  The python setuptools ports have been renamed to better match other python ports.
  Ports users need to rename them so that portupgrade and portmaster do not
  get confused.  For example:

    pkg set -n py27-setuptools27:py27-setuptools
    pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools27:devel/py27-setuptools
  or
    pkg set -n py35-setuptools35:py35-setuptools

  AFFECTS: users of devel/mtbl
  AUTHOR: truckman@FreeBSD.org

  There is a libmtbl shared library version bump in mtbl version 1.0.0.
  The affected dependent ports have had PORTREVISION bumps, but you will
  need to rebuild any applications that link to libmtbl.

20170220:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/filebeat sysutils/metricbeat sysutils/packetbeat
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The three elasticsearch beats ports have merged into one single port
  systuils/beats that installs all of the above and some more. The reason is to
  make the port more maintainable and also that the new heartbeat beat would
  conflict with sysutils/heartbeat.

20170220:
  AFFECTS: devel/libevent2
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  libevent2 has been renamed back to libevent as the default version.
  If you manage out of tree ports make sure to run the following:

    # pkg set -n libevent2:libevent
    # pkg set -o devel/libevent2:devel/libevent

20170218:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 4 and Qt 5
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Following what is already done in Qt 5, the Qt 4 ports no longer install
  their binaries into ${LOCALBASE}/bin (which is "/usr/local/bin" in most
  cases). Additionally, the "-qt4" suffix has been dropped from the file names
  of the binaries that had it, such as "qmake-qt4".

  The new misc/qtchooser port is now used to choose whether a Qt 4 or Qt 5
  version of a binary such as "moc", "qmake" or "designer" will be used. By
  default, the Qt 5 versions are preferred, but that can be changed by setting
  the QT_SELECT environment variable to "qt4".

  qtchooser also allows one to seamlessly use other Qt installations for those
  binaries, which is particularly beneficial to people working on Qt itself or
  who need their own checkouts.

  See qtchooser(1) for more information on how to configure qtchooser.

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/libGL, graphics/libEGL, graphics/libglesv2
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The workaround for handling conflicting libraries between the
  nvidia-driver, libGL, libEGL and libglesv2 ports was removed. If the
  nvidia-driver port is updated before the other ports, it will remove
  the libraries of said ports. This is a side effect of how the workaround
  worked. If this happens reinstalling the affected port is enough.

  pkg users can run: pkg install -f libGL libEGL libglesv2

20170211:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-server/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: rezny@FreeBSD.org

  Xorg server has been updated to 1.18.4 and autodetection has changed.
  The order in which drivers are now attempted is:
    1) vendor/model specific driver according to PCI IDs
    2) generic modesetting driver which requires a drm driver with KMS
    3) scfb, the generic framebuffer driver
    4) vesa (only if arch is x86)

  This should minimize the need for xorg.conf files. It is recommended to
  load the correct KMS driver (i915kms.ko or radeonkms.ko) via rc.conf,
  i.e. kld_list="i915kms.ko", to ensure correct functionality. Although
  the vendor drivers may attempt to load the correct drm driver, which
  does not always work, the modesetting driver assumes the required KMS
  driver is already loaded and will fail if there is none. The modesetting
  driver is now recommended as an alternative to the Intel driver; the
  performance is comparable and stability is better with modesetting. The
  ATI driver continues to offer better performance than modesetting.

20170203:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl-devel
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The version 2.5.1 bumps the libcrypto, libssl and libtls shared library
  versions. You will have to rebuild all packages that depend on
  libressl-devel. Check the 20160811 libressl entry for more detailed
  guidance on rebuilding.

20170202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uwsgi
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The previous disruptive changes to uwsgi for security have been remediated
  through creation of a dedicated uwsgi user/group and utilizing the
  uwsgi feature to set socket ownership. The uwsgi daemon by default now
  has the following properties:

  * Process runs as uwsgi user and group (UID/GID 165)
  * Socket mode is 660, still protecting unauthorized access from "other"
  * Socket ownership is www:www, restoring compatibility

20170130:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/ice, devel/py-ice, devel/php5-ice
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  Since __WORDSIZE as defined by <stdint.h> always reports 32 when using
  C++98/03 (unless __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS is set explictly), Ice 3.6.3 used
  "long long" for Int64 instead of "long" on 64-bit platforms by mistake.
  A workaround has been added in version 3.6.3_2 of these three ports,
  requiring to upgrade all of them at the same time and to rebuild all
  custom code that links against them.

20170129:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/motion
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  Version 3.x expected the configuration files to reside in:
	${LOCALBASE}/etc
  Version 4.x expects the configuration files to reside in:
	${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion
  This was unfortunately overlooked when the port was updated to 4.x, but it
  has now been fixed to install the default configuration file in the new
  location. The rc script now checks for motion.conf in the new location.

  While you may be able to simply copy your old motion.conf to the new location,
  it is recommended to review ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion/motion.conf and make
  changes to it based on your old ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion.conf as some options
  have been added and removed.

  Further, if you use motion with multiple cameras and have
  ${LOCALBASE}/etc/thread[0-9].conf files, they should be moved to
  ${LOCALBASE}/etc/motion as well. These files are deprecated and should be
  renamed to camera[0-9].conf and in motion.conf, lines like:
	thread /usr/local/etc/thread1.conf
  Should be converted to:
	camera /usr/local/etc/motion/camera1.conf

20170127:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uwsgi
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The default socket mode for uwsgi as 777 is a severe security concern.
  This has been remediated by changing the rc script to default to 600.
  The mode is configurable with rc.conf values: uwsgi_socket_mode="600"
  or for a profile named "www", uwsgi_www_socket_mode="600".

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql56-server
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  databases/mysql56-server was updated to 5.6.35 which included backported
  rc script changes from the mysql57-server port. This broke mysql_optfile in
  rc.conf and also forced a sample my.cnf if none existed. MySQL has
  some parameters which cannot be changed after a database has been
  created, so this caused MySQL to fail to start.

  This change was reverted in mysql56-server-5.6.35_1

  An additional change was made in mysql56-server-5.6.35_2 to prevent
  automatic loading of a sample my.cnf which was causing issues for
  users who were running without a my.cnf.

20170117:
  AFFECTS: users of EoL'ed FreeBSD versions (<10.3, 11 prior to 11.0)
  AUTHOR: amdmi3@FreeBSD.org

  The ports system will now refuse to build anything if it's run on
  outdated system version. This protects users from unexpected build
  failures after code to support EoL'ed systems is removed from the

  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.2 to 2.3.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.2 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.2 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.2

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby23 lang/ruby22
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.3

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby22:lang/ruby23
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.3.\* -fr lang/ruby23

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bareos-*
  AUTHOR: rand@iteris.com

  Bareos v1.6.x changed the configuration scheme, from one configuration
  file per Bareos component (file daemon, storage daemon, and director)
  to several configuration files, in several directories, for each
  component. See http://doc.bareos.org/master/html/bareos-manual-main-reference.html

  The new scheme will use all files named *.conf in the directory
  hierarchies for each component:

    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/
    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/
    /usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.d/

  To retain the old configuration scheme of one file per component add
  appropriate lines such as these to your /etc/rc.conf:

    bareos_dir_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.conf"
    bareos_fd_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.conf"
    bareos_sd_config="/usr/local/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.conf"

20161113:

  The libosinfo port was separated into three different ports
  to follow the upstream split:

   - sysutils/osinfo-db-tools: contains the CLI tools
   - misc/osinfo-db: contains database with OS data
   - devel/libosinfo: the library

  As osinfo-db-tools now ships binaries that previously were
  part of libosinfo, it's required to delete the old libosinfo
  package to prevent conflict because of same files installation:

  # pkg delete libosinfo

  And then install the new version.

20161112:
  AFFECTS: users of security/heimdal
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Heimdal in the base system and security/heimdal <= 1.5.3_6 use
  Berkeley DB to store principals into /var/heimdal/heimdal.db and
  the database format is version 3 by default.  On the other hand,
  security/heimdal 1.5.3_7 or newer use the newer version of
  Berkeley DB and the database format is version 9.
  These two versions are not compatible with each other.  If there is
  a mismatch between Heimdal utilities and its database format,
  you will get an error like the following:

  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l dump
  BDB0641 __db_meta_setup: /var/heimdal/heimdal.db: unexpected file type or format
  kadmin: hdb_open: opening /var/heimdal/heimdal: Invalid argument

  This mismatch can occur in the following three cases:

  1. You used Heimdal in the base system and switch to use security/heimdal
     after creating /var/db/heimdal.db.

  2. You used security/heimdal >= 1.5.3_7 and switch to use one in the
     base system.

  3. You used security/heimdal < 1.5.3_7 and upgrade it to 1.5.3_7 or later.

  To fix this mismatch, you need to dump contents of heimdal.db and
  rebuild the database by using kadmin(8) utility.

  If you use Heimdal in the base system or older versions of
  security/heimdal, and plan to switch to use
  security/heimdal >= 1.5.3_7, execute the following command
  *after* creating a backup copy of /var/heimdal and installing
  security/heimdal:

  # /usr/bin/kadmin -l dump /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db
  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l load /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump

  The above example assumes security/heimdal is installed into
  /usr/local.  If your base system is compiled with WITHOUT_KERBEROS
  use the following instead:

  # db_dump185-5 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db | db_load-5 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new
  # chown 0600 /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new
  # mv /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.new /var/heimdal/heimdal.db

  db_dump and db_load utilitites are installed by database/db5 as
  dependency of security/heimdal.

  If you want to switch from security/heimdal to Heimdal in the base
  system, use the following:

  # /usr/local/sbin/kadmin -l dump /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db
  # /usr/bin/kadmin -l load /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump
  # rm /var/heimdal/heimdal.db.dump

  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The package name of mail/mu4e* have been changed from mu4e* to
  mu4e*-emacsNN.  When upgrading the older versions, this change can
  cause the following error which prevents it from upgrading:

   pkg-static: mu4e-emacs25-0.9.16 conflicts with mu4e-0.9.16 (installs files into the same place).

  If this error occurs, please remove the old packages by using
  "pkg delete" manually:

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.24.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, assuming you are
  migrating from 5.20 to 5.24, do:

  First, add to /etc/make.conf:

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=  perl5=5.24

  Portupgrade users:
	portupgrade -o lang/perl5.24 -f lang/perl5.20

	  You can now remove the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line added earlier
	  from /etc/make.conf

	  Then you will need to rebuild everything that uses libperl.so, you
	  can do so with:

	portupgrade -f `pkg shlib -qR libperl.so.5.20`

	  If, for some reason, this command fails at one point, it is safe to
	  run it again, it will not rebuild what it already rebuilt, as the
	  ports that have been rebuilt no longer depend on libperl.so.5.20 but
	  on libperl.so.5.24.

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.24 lang/perl5.20

	  You can now remove the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line added earlier
	  from /etc/make.conf

	  Then you will need to rebuild everything that uses libperl.so, you
	  can do so with:

	portmaster -f `pkg shlib -qR libperl.so.5.20`

	  If, for some reason, this command fails at one point, it is safe to
	  run it again, it will not rebuild what it already rebuilt, as the
	  ports that have been rebuilt no longer depend on libperl.so.5.20 but

  audio/logitechmediaserver, the server and database are now installed in
  different locations by default (/usr/local/share/logitechmediaserver and
  /var/db/logitechmediaserver respectively).

  If you were an existing user of audio/squeezeboxserver, you should
  consider backing up you server configuration files and database before
  upgrading to audio/logitechmediaserver. If you wish to override the

  1. Log off from Roundcube.
  2. Manually drop all carddav_* tables from your db backend.
  3. Upgrade the mail/roundcube-carddav port.

  The new tables will be created upon login. The CardDAV plugin will need to be
  reconfigured.

  If you are running php < 7.0.0, you'll need to set the plugin option:

  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql96-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The default unix user used by the PostgreSQL daemon has changed to
  `postgres' to reflect the long time upstream's convention. Any scripts
  you have using the old `pgsql' unix user should be modified when upgrading to
  PostgreSQL version 9.6. Older versions of PostgreSQL will continue using
  `pgsql' until their end-of-life.

  For users with UTF-8 locales in the database: The ICU patch is *activated by
  default* for the PostgreSQL-9.6 server. For previous versions it was optional
  and default off, but this has changed. Please read the entry here below from
  20160811 and understand the consequences of changing between ICU and system
  locale for database collation (short version: don't). pg_upgrade requires the
  collation method to be the same (or a reindex), while pg_dump/restore does not.

  Also, the default home directory for the postgres user is now
  /var/db/postgres, and the default data directory for PostgreSQL 9.6 is
  /var/db/postgres/data96.

  new driver component works in conjunction with the nvidia.ko kernel
  module to program the display engine of the GPU.

  Users that experience hangs when starting X11 server, or observe

	(II) NVIDIA(0): Validated MetaModes:
	(II) NVIDIA(0):     "NULL"

  messages in their /var/log/Xorg.0.log file should replace ``nvidia''
  with ``nvidia-modeset'' in /boot/loader.conf or /etc/rc.conf files,
  depending on how they prefer to load NVidia driver kernel module.

20160829:
  AFFECTS: users of security/sshguard
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Sshguard has been updated to 1.7.0. There have been several changes to
  this release. Notably the hosts and ipfilter backends are no longer
  supported. If you need these backends to be supported and you missed
  the survey sent out by upstream I urge you to contact upstream.

  The hosts backend was previously served by security/sshguard directly.
  The additional backends were slave ports with package name suffixes. I
  have opted to keep the master/slave port relationship but not choose a
  specific backend for security/sshguard. Instead it is now a metaport
  which will prompt you for which backend you prefer. If no backend is
  configured it will depend on security/sshguard-ipfw, which is the
  native FreeBSD firewall. This my be surprising to users who depended
  on security/sshguard which only provided hosts/TCP Wrappers blocking,
  but there is no replacement at this time.

  I would also like to document that sshguard no longer accepts the -e
  argument which allowed external scripts to run when sshguard finds a
  match. As a result the null backend can no longer be used to create
  custom blocking functionality; it only serves as a detection backend.

  If the removed backends return due to user demand they will be added
  as slave ports for consistency. I apologize for any inconvenience and
  lack of notice on the deprecation of these features.

  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.4 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.
  With this update, the patch for the OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER has been
  removed. This causes issues with a number of ports. Patches for all
  ports for which this issues is known can be found on
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/LibreSSL/Ports#OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20160811:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresqlNN-server with ICU patch
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The ICU patch is added to the PostgreSQL-9.5 server. Please note that you
  must never change between using the ICU patch and using system locale for
  the same database cluster without REINDEXing all TEXT/VARCHAR columns, or
  dump and restore your database. Failing to do so will result in corrupted
  indexes due to the differences between the locale definitions. ICU will
  always be the better choice for speed and correctness.

  Also, the ICU patch used to support other Unicode encodings than UTF-8,
  but that has been removed due to lack of demand and the complicated testing
  required. If you use another Unicode encoding and rely on ICU for collation,
  please refrain from upgrading the postgresql server and instead contact the
  author named above.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/qtcreator
  AUTHOR: loise@kde.org

  QBS (Qt Build System) was previously shipped as part of qtcreator, now
  it is independently available as devel/qbs. However, on upgrading
  qtcreator to 3.6.1, the depends will detect qbs through a previously
  installed qtcreator port and will not build/install correctly
  (devel/qbs won't be installed automatically as depends)

  The solution is to pkg remove qtcreator, then building works correctly.

20160523:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/db6 port has been updated to release 6.2.23.

  This requires manual action in two places:
    1. dependent applications need to be recompiled,
    2. SQL databases, if any, need to be reindexed.

  To obtain a list of ports needing a recompilation,
  the following command should provide it:

  # pkg info -r db6

  Then rebuild db6 and the dependent ports.  For pkg users, this should
  be transparent.

  Portmaster users:
  #  portmaster -r databases/db6
  Portupgrade users:
  #  portupgrade -fr databases/db6

  In order to reindex SQL databases, a db6-upgrade61.sh script is
  provided in ${PREFIX}/bin, if and only if the port's SQL option is
  enabled.  For detailed reindexing instructions, see
  http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_05/html/installation/sqlite_ver61.html
  and note that the FreeBSD port installs the upgrade61.sh script with a
  db6- prefix that you need to add.

  AFFECTS: users of audio/clementine-player
  AUTHOR: sbruno@FreeBSD.org

  The audio/clementine-player port has been updated to v1.3.1, the latest
  upstream release.  The music database code now has a hard dependency on
  databases/sqlite having the FTS3_TOKENIZER option enabled.  This has
  been made the default option in databases/sqlite.

  Without this option, clementine-player will crash on startup.

20160510:
  AFFECTS: users of biology/seqan
  AUTHOR: junovitch@FreeBSD.org

  The biology/seqan port has been split into biology/seqan (only the
  library) and biology/seqan-apps for the programs based on SeqAn. Both
  ports are based on version 2.1.1 of the SeqAn repository. There is a new
  biology/seqan1 port with version 1.3 of SeqAn for backwards compatibility,
  but this port will likely be deprecated in the next year so please update
  your software to SeqAn2.

20160505:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bradleythughes@fastmail.fm

  The www/node port has been updated to node.js v6.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. Users of node.js v5.x are encouraged to upgrade as
  soon as possible, as upstream support will end two months from now.

  The www/node5 port has been created to aid users transition. Use one of
  the following commands to continue using node.js v5.x:

  # pkg install node5
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node5 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node5 www/node

20160503:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  LibreSSL 2.3 has removed SSLv3 support completely which leads to issues
  with a number of ports. Patches for many of these issues can be found
  on https://wiki.freebsd.org/OpenSSL/No-SSLv3

  After upgrading to 2.3.4, manually update all packages that depend on
  any of the libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and
  libtls) since the versions of these libraries have changed. Normally,
  you can obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20160501:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dspam
  AUTHOR: junovitch@FreeBSD.org

  dspam has been modified to no longer run as root:mail by default.
  Existing configuration must be adjusted to reflect using a non-privileged
  port and the /var/run/dspam directory for PID and socket files.  If you
  need dspam to run as root for your mail setup, you can use the SETUID
  config option to enable the old insecure behavior.

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/icinga2
  AUTHOR: lme@FreeBSD.org

  The creation of Icinga2 directories and files in /var is now controlled
  by the /etc/rc.conf variable icinga2_mkvar.  Earlier ports always
  created the /var entries, but could slow startup significantly when /var
  was a normal disk rather than a RAM disk.  icinga2_mkvar defaults to
  "NO".

  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba 4.2.x and 4.3.x ports have been updated to address
  BadLock(http://badlock.org) vulnerability, as well as few other
  discovered.

  Please note that Samba 4.1.x and older versions are also affected by

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby21
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.1 to 2.2.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.1 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.1 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.1

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby22 lang/ruby21
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.2

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby21:lang/ruby22

  AFFECTS: print/cups-base, print/cups-client, print/cups-image
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The cups-base, cups-client and cups-image packages have been combined
  into one cups package.

  If you build your own ports the easiest way to update is to delete these
  packages first and then build and install print/cups.

  If you are using binary packages, depending on the packages installed on
  your system, pkg(8)'s solver might get confused. In this case do not proceed
  with the upgrade but delete first the packages:

  pkg delete -fg "cups*"

  Then usual upgrade process: pkg upgrade

  The device URI of USB printers has changed so you have to adjust the
  printer configuration.  Go to http://localhost:631/printers/.  Click on
  your printer and select "Modify Printer" in the Administration drop-down.
  You should then be able to select the new URI of the printer.  The web
  interface requires cookies and JavaScript to function properly so make
  sure your browser does not block them.

  The package also installs a devd(8) configuration file now that gives
  cups access to USB printers.  Unless you have any special needs you can
  remove any devd(8), devfs.conf(5) or devfs.rules(5) configuration related
  to cups that you may have added in the past.

  AUTHOR: junovitch@FreeBSD.org

  CodeIgniter has been updated to the 3.0.x release branch. End users
  must ensure their web applications are compliant with the guidance
  in the "Upgrading From a Previous Version" document.

  http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/upgrade_300.html

  CodeIgniter 2.2.x has reached EOL as of 31 October 2015 but may be
  installed in the interim from the www/codeigniter22 port.

  # pkg delete security/keepassx2
  # portmaster security/keepassx2

20151019:
  AFFECTS: users of www/varnish4
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Varnish has been updated to 4.1.0. As part of the update an effort has
  been made to increase the security of the varnish daemons by utilizing
  separate UIDs. Users who upgrade will likely run into a permissions
  issue as a result. The simplest solution is to delete files varnish
  will recreate with the correct permissions and to adjust permissions
  of existing log files.

  The following changes will allow you to start varnishd, varnishlog,
  and varnishncsa successfully:

  # rm -r /usr/local/varnish/$(hostname)
  # rm /var/run/varnishlog.pid
  # rm /var/run/varnishncsa.pid
  # chown varnishlog /var/log/varnish.log
  # chown varnishlog /var/log/varnishncsa.log

  Please also note that the syntax for binding to additional IPs has
  changed in 4.1.0. Multiple listening addresses are now specified by
  using multiple -a arguments. In rc.conf it would look like this:

  varnishd_listen="x.x.x.x:80 -a y.y.y.y:80"

  AFFECTS: users of security/sshguard-ipfw
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The sshguard update to 1.6.2 introduces a rewritten IPFW backend. The
  previous approach was to insert individual block rules with a
  predefined  numbered range. This does not scale well and is not
  flexible so the design was scrapped. The new approach utilizes IPFW
  tables. The sshguard IPFW backend now inserts offenders into hardcoded
  table 22.

  To continue blocking the attackers effectively you will need to add a
  block rule like the following:

  ipfw add deny all from 'table(22)' to any

  AUTHOR: sbruno@FreeBSD.org

  The Jemalloc update at svn r286871 introduced some TLS enhancements
  for MIPS targets that require a bit of workaround.  Users who want
  to build MIPS packages should update their host systems past r286871
  prior to upgrading their qemu-user-static/qemu-sbruno ports.

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/ffmpeg
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  ffmpeg has been updated to the version 2.8.
  If you are using binary pkg, 'pkg upgrade' will do the right thing.
  Users of portmaster/portupgrade must rebuild all ports which depend
  on ffmpeg.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -w -r ffmpeg
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr multimedia/ffmpeg

20150916:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/jpeg
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  Default implementation of jpeg has been switched from graphics/jpeg to
  graphics/jpeg-turbo.  To perform the upgrade, use instructions below.

  If using binary packages: 'pkg upgrade' will do the right thing.  If it
  doesn't and complains about 'Cannot solve problem using SAT solver', run
  'pkg delete -f jpeg' before 'pkg upgrade'.

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o graphics/jpeg-turbo jpeg

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -f -o graphics/jpeg-turbo graphics/jpeg

  If you compile your ports and want to keep using IJG's jpeg implementation,
  add this line to your /etc/make.conf file:
  JPEG_PORT=graphics/jpeg

20150914:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Binary package users can ignore this.

  The way lang/perl5* ports install themselves has changed.  From now on, only
  the default Perl port (currently 5.20), or the version listed in
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS, will install /usr/local/bin/perl.

  If you are NOT using the default version of Perl (as of right now, it is
  5.20) you MUST add a line setting the version you are using to your
  /etc/make.conf, to preserve /usr/local/bin/perl:

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=	perl5=5.xx

  If your Perl package name is not called perl5-5.xx.y but perl5.xx-5.xx.y,
  you will need to rename it so that portupgrade and portmaster do not get
  confused:

    pkg set -n perl5.xx:perl5

  After this date, to migrate from one Perl version to the other, you must
  first put the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line in your make.conf, and then, for example,
  if you want to move from 5.20 to 5.22, do:

	pkg set -o lang/perl5.20:lang/perl5.22
	portmaster `pkg shlib -qR libperl.so.5.20`

  If you do not do that, you will replace your default Perl 5.20 installation
  (one that has /usr/local/bin/perl) with an installation that does not have
  /usr/local/bin/perl, and it will break everything.

20150908:
  AFFECTS: users of print/texlive-base
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  pdfclose and pdfopen utilities in print/texlive-base are now in a separate
  port print/xpdfopen.  While upgrading print/texlive-base, a conflict may
  occur between pdfclose utility installed by an old print/texlive-base and
  one being installed by print/xpdfopen.  If it occurred on your system,
  remove the installed print/texlive-base first by using the following
  command:

   # pkg delete -f texlive-base

20150901:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/libreoffice
  AUTHOR: jkim@FreeBSD.org

  editors/libreoffice has been updated to 5.0.1.  However, FreeBSD 9.x is
  no longer supported because it requires C++11-capable library installed
  in the base.  If you cannot upgrade your system or still want 4.3.x for
  some reason, use editors/libreoffice4.

20150822:
  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/ghostscript{7,8,9,9-agpl} have been split into
  print/ghostscript{7,8,9,9-agpl}-{base,x11}.
  print/ghostscript*-nox11 ports have been removed.

  The -base installs Ghostscript binaries, libgs, and other data files
  and it depends on no X11 library.  The -x11 installs a small shared
  library to enable x11* devices in the installed -base package.

  In most cases, Ghostscript is installed as a dependency.  A port/package
  which requires Ghostscript will automatically pick up -base, and
  when x11* devices required it will pick up -x11 in addition.

  If one wants to install Ghostscript manually and full compatibility
  with the previous versions, just install -x11 because it installs
  -base as a dependency.  Combination of the two provides the same
  functionality as before.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  7.10.2 and Haskell Platform has been removed.  As a result, it is
  recommended to rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports and the
  lang/ghc port itself in one of the following ways:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  In case of pkg(8), it is probably safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.  For
  example:

  # pkg query "%ro" ghc > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc

  In ghc-pkgs.txt, check and remove all the packages that have been moved,
  then:

  # pkg install -y `cat ghc-pkgs.txt`

  s6-svc options have changed for sending syncronous up/down timeouts.
  Any management or wrapper scripts using those options will need to

20150812:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/icinga and net-mgmt/icinga2
  AUTHOR: lme@FreeBSD.org

  The Icinga port has been split into two ports: net-mgmt/icinga-core
  which contains the Icinga 1.x backend and net-mgmt/icinga-classicweb
  which contains the Icinga classic web (CGI) interface. The latter can
  be both used with Icinga 1.x and the Icinga 2 port (net-mgmt/icinga2).
  A new meta-port net-mgmt/icinga was added which depends on both new
  ports, so updating the Icinga port should be transparent.

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/moosefs-master and other moosefs packages
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  MooseFS ports have been updated to 2.0.72-1. Upstream has been
  providing a private package repository to distribute newer releases of
  MooseFS. These changes have now made it into the ports tree. This has
  resulted in splitting up the sysutils/moosefs-master port into several
  new ports:

  sysutils/moosefs-cli
  sysutils/moosefs-cgi
  sysutils/moosefs-cgiserv
  sysutils/moosefs-metalogger

  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, assuming you are
  migrating from 5.18 to 5.20, do:

  Portupgrade users:
	portupgrade -o lang/perl5.20 -f lang/perl5.18

	portupgrade -f `pkg shlib -R libperl.so.5.18|tail +2`

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.20 lang/perl5.18

	portmaster -f `pkg shlib -R libperl.so.5.18|tail +2`

  NOTE:
    Perl has been removed from base more than ten years ago, so it was way past
    time for the /usr/bin/perl symlink to be removed from the port.  If for
    some strange reason, you still need it, you will have to create it
    manually.

  IMPORTANT:
    In case you have not updated your system in a while, and specifically,
    followed the 20141126 instructions regarding the new Perl layout, you

  AFFECTS: users of irc/rbot
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Ruby Bot now has a new upstream maintainer.  The project has been updated
  to work with Ruby 2.0+.  Some migration is needed to move away from
  BDB regristry files.  The guide for that is at
  https://github.com/ruby-rbot/rbot/wiki/MigrationGuide

  rbotdb can be used to backup a BDB database and then restore it to a working
  format for the new rbot. Update your conf.yaml after with 'core.db: tc'
  once converted.

  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_dav_svn
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  Subversion modules are no longer activated in httpd.conf!
  To activate the subversion apache modules a dedicated file
  will be installed as modules.d/220_subversion.conf

  AFFECTS: users of dns/bind9*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  This is only for FreeBSD 10.0+.

  BIND auto chroot has been added back to the named rc script.  As enabling it
  by default would most certainly break people's setup, it is not.  To enable
  it, and chroot it in /var/named, add the following line to your rc.conf file:

  named_chrootdir="/var/named"

  On first launch, the rc script will move the /usr/local/etc/namedb directory
  into the chroot, and create a symlink to it.

  Note that, if you're running from within a jail, you need to have a
  /var/named/dev devfs created beforehand, with the null and random devices.

20150323:
  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk* and net/pjsip ports
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Due to conflicts between base OpenSSL and ports provided OpenSSL
  library, which is required by net/libsrtp, the srtp support has
  to be removed from the default asterisk13 port configuration,
  otherwise a not working binary would be generated.

  To get SRTP support working in the asterisk ports make sure all
  dependencies are linked against the same SSL library implementation
  to avoid runtime conflicts. On 10.1 everything will work fine
  unless ports SSL libraries are explicitly installed. On older OS
  versions(10.0 and earlier) you will need to compile all ports
  with WITH_OPENSSL_PORT=yes.

  To get working SRTP support in asterisk13 with the pjsip backend
  it is also needed to enable the EXTSRTP option in the pjsip port.

  If the CURL option is enabled also make sure the ftp/curl port
  is using a GSSAPI implementation linking to the same SSL
  implementation the other ports are using (BASE or NONE if you're
  using base OpenSSL, GSSAPI_HEIMDAL GSSAPI_MIT otherwise). If an
  incompatible option is being used the curl module will cause
  asterisk to fail on startup due to mixing calls to OpenSSL from
  base and from ports.

20150322:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  The port now uses VersionAddendum for the port version string. Setting
  the value to "none" in your sshd_config and restarting openssh will allow
  removing the version from the banner.

  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server and other X servers
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  All fonts ports have been modified to respect XDG and install in
  share/fonts

  The Xorg servers now are looking there by default

  If you experience font related issues, view the output of

  # fc-list

  If the list appears incomplete or has fonts still pointing to
  /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts you may forcibly update the font cache:

  # fc-cache -fs

  AFFECTS: users of editors/openoffice-4 and editors/openoffice-devel
  AUTHOR: truckman@FreeBSD.org

  Contrary to what is stated in pkg-message, openoffice-4 and
  openoffice-devel have stored user settings in ~/.openoffice.org-devel/4
  since r325370 (2013-08-25). This update expects user settings to reside
  in the more standard ~/.openoffice.org/4.

20150304:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@highsecure.ru

  After upgrading of libressl you should manually update all packages that
  depending on this library since its version has been changed. Normally,
  you could obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  pkg query -e '%n = libressl' %ro

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20150301:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby20
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.0 to 2.1.

  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.0 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.0

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade -f

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby21 lang/ruby20
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.1

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby20:lang/ruby21
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.1.\* -fr lang/ruby21

  program to access the daemon or the GUI, install net-p2p/bitcoin-utils
  to reinstall them.

20150220:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP

  The default PHP version has been updated from 5.4 to 5.6.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php5\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd-devel
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  MYSQL, PGSQL, LDAP, and REDIS options are removed from port, as
  they're moved upstream to a separate project, which is yet to
  release snapshots. If you need those options, then please install
  "mail/opensmtpd" port instead. To do that:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o mail/opensmtpd mail/opensmtpd-devel

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o mail/opensmtpd mail/opensmtpd-devel

20150206:
  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The java dependency changed from java 7 (java/openjdk7 if you haven't
  installed another java 7 implementation) to java 8 (e.g. java/openjdk8).
  If serviio is the only reason that java 7 is installed, you can delete
  java 7 after the update to serviio 1.5.0.

  The Java Polling Watch Service used in Serviio 1.5 aggressively searches
  for file system updates. Until the Serviio poller is re-enabled in 1.5.1,
  consider unchecking "Keep library automatically updated" if you have a
  large media collection or are concerned about CPU/disk usage.

20150204:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.5 to 5.6.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.5 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.5 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql= 5.5

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  # pkg set -o databases/mysql55-client:databases/mysql56-client

  # pkg upgrade

20150118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/thttpd
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  thttpd was updated to version 2.26, which brings several user-noticeable
  changes to the port:

    - Default WWW root was changed from ${PREFIX}/www/data to more expected
      (and standard) ${WWWDIR} (${PREFIX}/www/thttpd), be sure to check and
      adjust your thttpd configuration file and/or web layout accordingly;
    - Default CGI pattern was changed to "/cgi-bin/*"; this goes better in
      line with default installation;
    - Default data MIME type was changed to "application/octet-stream";
    - thttpd's own htpasswd(1) program, which was previously installed as
      thttpdpasswd(1) to avoid conflict with other webservers, is now being
      renamed to thtpasswd(1); this not just makes it shorter, but is more
      consistent with popular GNU/Linux distributions;
    - Index pages for directories are not generated by default from now on
      for security reasons; an option (INDEXES) is provided to turn them
      back on if they are wanted;
    - IPREAL option (to respect (pass on) "X-Forwarded-For" header) is now
      turned on by default: it is often required when thttpd is used as a
      CGI server behind nginx (http://wiki.nginx.org/ThttpdCGI).

  AFFECTS: users of net/unison and net/unison-nox11
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.48, which uses a different wire
  protocol than 2.40 did.  In order to support synchronization with
  other computers where Unison is still at version 2.40, a new port
  net/unison240 has been created.  It provides unison240 and if that is
  GTK2-enabled, also unison240-text.  This unison240 port can be
  installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

20141219:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg and all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: dumbbell@FreeBSD.org

  The X.Org server (x11-servers/xorg-server) is updated to 1.14. All
  ports which provide X.Org drivers must be updated simultaneously, i.e.
  x11-drivers/xf86-*, emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions, net/tigervnc,
  etc.

  The input device autodetection backend is switched from HAL to devd.
  If you configure your keyboard layout through HAL .fdi files, you need
  to migrate this configuration to plain X.Org configuration files.

  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  Xymon has been updated to 4.3.18. A major change is the replacement of
  the individual cgi shell scripts with symlinks to a cgi program written
  in C. This is to mitigate shellshock on Linux systems where the
  /bin/sh -> /bin/bash. FreeBSD users were not exposed except in the
  most unusual and unsupported circumstances. However, this is an
  important update for security. This change could break your
  configuration as Henrik describes here:

  OpenSSH 6.7 disables some insecure ciphers by default, such as arcfour
  and blowfish. You may have clients using these over LAN where security is
  considered less important for the connection. For these cases you may need
  to update your Ciphers entry in your sshd_config to enable them again.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl now links all .so it builds with libperl.so, it makes upgrading from one
  Perl major version to another way easier.  For binary package users, it means
  pkg upgrade will detect the libperl.so.x.yy change, and reinstall the
  affected packages.  For users using ports, it will save rebuild time as it's
  easier to detect what ports really need to be rebuilt.

  Ports users are encouraged to rebuild ports that install files in SITE_ARCH.
  If using Perl 5.18, run:

  With portupgrade:

    portupgrade -f `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

  With portmaster:

    portmaster `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

  AFFECTS: users of TeXLive
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Several scripts in print/texlive-base have been moved to
  devel/tex-kpathsea.  Upgrading them can fail because texlive-base
  depends on tex-kpathsea, and the new tex-kpathsea tries to install
  files which were installed by the old texlive-base.  The following
  error message indicates this situation:

    pkg-static: tex-kpathsea-6.2.0_1 conflicts with texlive-base-20140525_3 (installs files into the same place).  Problematic file: /usr/local/bin/kpsewhere

  To solve this problem, remove both of tex-kpathsea and texlive-base first
  and install the new versions:

	# pkg delete -f tex-kpathsea texlive-base

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  The CentOS ports infrastructure has replaced Fedora 10 as default.

  1. Please delete all remaining f10 ports/packages:

     # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*

  2. Persistently update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:

     compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18

    This step is necessary on all FreeBSD versions, apart from 11.0-CURRENT
    (after revision 271982).

  3. Reinstall all software depending on Linux emulation.
     As an example, reinstall linux-firefox:

     # portmaster -r linux-firefox
       or
     # portupgrade -f www/linux-firefox
       or
     # pkg install linux-firefox

  If difficulties are encountered, please follow the UPDATING entry 20140922
  but skip step 2 (OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT and OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS
  in /etc/make.conf). In case these steps do not fix the issues, please submit
  an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing
  list.

  Users who need to continue using Fedora 10 base and userland should do the
  following instead:

  1. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:

      OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f10
      OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f10

  2. Downgrade the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf on FreeBSD versions
     newer than and including 11.0-CURRENT (after revision 271982).

       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16

  This is all that is needed to continue using an existing Fedora 10 Linux base
  and userland.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The directories where Perl modules are installed has changed.  All
  affected ports' PORTREVISION have been bumped, so upgrading should
  be as painless as possible.  The old directories have been kept in
  the default Perl @INC to make it even more painless.

  The default Perl has been switched to lang/perl5.18.  These examples
  are for switching from lang/perl5.16, if you are running a different
  version, replace lang/perl5.16 with the origin of the Perl you have
  installed.

  Binary package users:

    # pkg upgrade -f

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
        pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.18):
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.18 -f lang/perl5.16

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
        portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.18

  Portmaster users:
        portmaster -o lang/perl5.18 lang/perl5.16

        Conservative:
        portmaster p5-

        Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
        portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: If the "perl5-" glob matches more than one port you will need to specify
        the name of the installed Perl package explicitly.  You can get its name
        by running: pkg info perl5

20141125:
  AFFECTS: users of EFL libraries
  AUTHOR: gblach@FreeBSD.org

  EFL libraries has been merged into one port. Before installing devel/efl
  you must deinstall old EFL libraries:

  # pkg delete -f eina eet evas evas-\* ecore\* eio efreet embryo edje \
      ethumb emotion
  # make -C /usr/ports/devel/efl install clean

20141125:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/e17-module*
  AUTHOR: gblach@FreeBSD.org

  Enlightenment has been updated to 0.19.1. Some of e-modules can't be build
  with updated Enlightenment, these modules has been marked as broken.
  E-modules which work with new Enlightenment has been renamed to
  x11-wm/e-module-*. To update these modules you must call the following
  commands (substituting the name of module in place *):

  # portmaster -o x11-wm/e-module-* x11-wm/e17-module-*
  # portmaster -o x11-wm/e-modules x11-wm/e17-modules
  or
  # portupgrade -fo x11-wm/e-module-* x11-wm/e17-module-*

  The header and library files have been moved from PREFIX/{include,lib} to
  PREFIX/{include,lib}/heimdal at r373047 to fix a library dependency
  confusion when software attempts to link a Heimdal library in base and
  an external library in LOCALBASE/lib at the same time.

  All of packages which depend on security/heimdal have to be recompiled

  AFFECTS: users of x11/gnome2, graphics/clutter and lang/vala
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME 3.14 was imported. Because this is a big change some manual help is
  needed. Please use the following instructions to update.

  Make a list of the installed ports:
  # pkg info > ~/installed-ports-list

  Delete the old and conflicting packages:
  # pkg delete clutter gnome-utils gnome-panel gnome-keyring vala-vapigen \
      guile gcalctool gnome-media libgnomekbd gnome-themes at-spi
  # pkg delete gnome-screensaver gnome-applets bug-buddy \
      evolution-exchange evolution-webcal gnome-system-tools \
      seahorse-plugins gnome-control-center

  For package users the following lines will be enough:
  # pkg upgrade
  # pkg install gnome3

  For ports users should do the following:
  # portmaster -a
  # portmaster x11/gnome3

  After these steps, check with the list we made earlier if your favorite
  ports are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

	# pkg delete -f kde-runtime-4\*

20141008:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby19
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 1.9 to 2.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 1.9 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 1.9 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=1.9

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby20 lang/ruby19
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.0

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby ruby-iconv portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby19:lang/ruby20
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.0.\* -fr lang/ruby20

  Due to the way pkg works please note that the configuration
  variables MAILDROP_SUID and MAILDROP_SGID, despite keeping their
  old names, are now required to contain a valid username and
  groupname existing on the system in which the package will be
  installed, while in the past numeric uids and gids worked fine.

  Wrong values will cause pkg to skip installing the setuid binaries
  on the system.

  Please check your configuration.

  AFFECTS: users of net/foreman-proxy
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  In version 1.6 Foreman Smart Proxy splits its configuration into multiple
  ruby files located in PREFIX/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d.
  The configuration of each service (dhcp, dhs, bmc, etc.) has been moved
  into a dedicated file.

  You can use a bundled script to convert your old settings to new settings:
  PREFIX/share/foreman/extra/migrate_settings.rb

20140926:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Bash supports a feature of exporting functions in the environment with
  export -f.  Running bash with exported functions in the environment will
  then import those functions into the environment of the script being ran.
  This resulted in security issues CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169, commonly
  known as "shellshock".  It also can result in poorly written scripts being
  tricked into running arbitrary commands.

  To fully mitigate against this sort of attack we have applied a non-upstream
  patch to disable this functionality by default.  You can execute bash
  with --import-functions to allow it to import functions from the
  environment.  The default can also be changed in the port by selecting the
  IMPORTFUNCTIONS option.

20140926:
  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk and net/asterisk11
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The asterisk ports have been modified to have the LUA option
  turned on by default to make such functionality available to users
  of binary packages.

  Some care should be taken before upgrading by people not using Lua
  to avoid the sample extensions.lua file from being loaded on reload
  after updating the asterisk port/pkg.

  Users compiling from ports not interested in LUA support are advised
  to disable the option before updating.

  People using binary packages(or not wanting to disable the LUA
  option in the port) not using the Lua functionality should add:

	noload => pbx_lua.so

  to the PREFIX/etc/asterisk/modules.conf file, if using the
  autoload=yes option in that same file. People not autoloading
  modules don't need to perform any special action.

  If asterisk is rebooted and the pbx_lua module gets loaded on a
  system were it should not, it will load the example extensions.lua
  configuration file adding unexpected logic to your dialplan. In
  such a case following the above steps and reloading asterisk will
  fix the problem.

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  The complete drop-in replacement linux-c6 port infrastructure is in
  ports and will shortly replace the current linux-f10- ports as default.

  To switch to the linux-c6 infrastructure:

  0. Back up all your vital information!
  1. Remove the current linux base port and all linux-f10- ports:
       # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*
  2. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=c6
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=c6
  3. Make sure no Linux application is running.
  4. Update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:
       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
     Make it take effect immediately:
       # sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
  5. Install emulators/linux-c6.

  These steps are usually sufficient. If there are difficulties, expand
  step 1 to:

  1a. Remove all ports which depend on the linux base port.
  1b. Remove the linux base port.
  1c. Clean the /compat/linux/ directory.

  If there are any other difficulties not fixed by these extended steps,
  please submit an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to
  FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing list.

  AFFECTS: users seeing build errors about missing *.la files
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  We are in the process of adjusting or, if possible, removing libtool archives
  (*.la files) from all ports because they can otherwise cause overlinking
  between packages.  This is the problem where in the dependency chain A->B->C
  an extra link is added from A to C even if A does not use C directly.  This
  makes some updates to port C expensive because then both A and B have to be
  rebuilt instead of just B.

  This is mostly behind the scenes work that you won't notice.  In fact most
  ports have already been converted.  You may however run into build errors
  about missing *.la files if a port update in the past went wrong and left
  behind *.la files with references to other *.la files that are no longer
  there.  In this case, please run the following command:

  find /usr/local/lib -name '*.la' | xargs grep -l 'libfoo\.la' | xargs pkg which
  (Replace libfoo\.la with the *.la file that is missing.)

  This command will print a list of *.la files that refer to the missing *.la
  file and what package they belong to.  First, where it says "not found in
  the database", remove the *.la file.  After removing all such files, where
  it says "installed by package X", rebuild X.  Eventually the list printed by
  that command will be empty and the build error should be gone.

  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Pkg has been updated to 1.3.7. This fixes registration and tracking of
  shared libraries. All earlier versions of Pkg incorrectly marked some
  shared libraries and used the wrong name for some.

  Please note announcement for special instructions at:
    http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports-announce/2014-August/000086.html

  - Users need to run 'pkg update -f' and 'pkg check -Ba' after upgrading to
    pkg-1.3.7 and before updating any other packages. This avoids needing to
    reinstall anything not needed due to changed shlibs.
     For binary package users:
      # pkg install ports-mgmt/pkg
      # pkg update -f
      # pkg check -Ba
      # pkg upgrade
     For port users:
      # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg build deinstall install clean
      # pkg check -Ba
  - People building packages for serving to other systems need to rebuild
    all packages with 1.3.7.

  If you were using the libjpeg.so from graphics/libjpeg-turbo, you
  should install graphics/jpeg-turbo AFTER upgrading the libjpeg-turbo
  port.

  AFFECTS: users of TeXLive
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  TeXLive in Ports Collection has been updated to TL2014.

  TL2012 packages, the following error may occur:

  pkg-static: texlive-base-20140525 conflicts with texlive-texmf-20120701_4

  Please remove texlive-texmf-20120701_4 first in that case.

  If you still get a similar "conflict of install files" error,
  please remove all of tex-* and texlive-* packages and then
  see if ${PREFIX}/share/texmf-dist directory are empty.  If not,
  installing TeXlive can fail.  Removing files in the directory
  manually will fix the installation problem.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4, databases/db4[1-7]*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  HEADS UP: for some applications that store their data in Berkeley DB
  databases, you may have to export the data before the upgrade and
  reload it afterwards.  Detailed instructions are at
  <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

  The older databases/db4* ports providing versions 4.0 to 4.7
  inclusively have been removed, and 4.8 has been deprecated.
  The default Berkeley DB version is now 5.3.
  (6.x has a different license, but will be eligible as default on
  systems that build ports from source and have db6 installed.)
    All enabled and working ports have been changed such that they use
  Berkeley DB 4.8 or newer, and an -exp run has been made.

  After you have performed the first steps from the Wiki documentation,
  and have arrived at a step that reads "build all applications", then
  type as privileged user and without the hash sign:

  # Tools/scripts/BDB-upgrade-helper.sh

  The helper script requires that ports-mgmt/portmaster or
  .../portupgrade is installed, will try to upgrade your applications
  with either of these tools (portmaster preferred), and if that succeeds,
  it will attempt to delete the packages if confirmed interactively.

20140815:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/ilmbase and graphics/OpenEXR
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenEXR and ilmbase (Industrial Light and Magic) shared object

  of these libraries, by using one of these commands:

  # portmaster -r ilmbase -r OpenEXR
    or
  # portupgrade -fr graphics/ilmbase graphics/OpenEXR

  The PORTREVISIONs of all ports that require ilmbase and/or OpenEXR
  have been bumped.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  7.8.3 and Haskell Platform to 2014.2.0.0.  Hence it is recommended to
  rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports and the lang/ghc port
  itself by one of the following commands:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  If you use pkg(8) then it is just safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.
  Something alone these lines may work:

  # pkg query "%ro" > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc
  # pkg install -y `cat ghc-pkgs.txt | grep -Ev "/hs-(haskeline|terminfo|transformers|xhtml)"

  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Oracle Berkeley DB 6 has been upgraded to version 6.1.19.  Since the
  previous 6.0 version, the log file format has changed in 6.1.
  Depending on applications used, you may need to take action BEFORE you
  upgrade.  For details, please see the online upgrade manual at
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/upgrading/upgrade_process.html>
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/installation/upgrade_61_toc.html>

  Note: if you've got Apache installed and depending on db6, you may
  need to upgrade it separately BEFORE upgrading other ports, such as
  Apache modules.

  After that, you must rebuild all applications that link to db6 because
  the shared library name has changed with the upgrade.  To do that:

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r db6-
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr databases/db6

  AFFECTS: users of comms/smstools3
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The smstools3 startup screen has been modified to allow smsd to
  change uid/gid by itself. The rc options smsd_logfile, smsd_user
  and smsd_group are not supported anymore, user, group and log
  filename should be specified in the configuration file.

  The sample configuration file has been updated to have defaults
  equivalent to the old ones.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/p5-Bucardo
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The bucardo_ctl script has been renamed to bucardo, so, to follow the naming,
  the bucardo_ctl_enable rc variable has been renamed to bucardo_enable.

20140622:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  If you have both security/gnupg AND security/gnupg1 installed, gpgme will
  now automatically detect and use security/gnupg.  Specifically, it will
  search for gpgconf(1) first and use the paths for the binaries provided
  by it.  Failing that, it will search for a binary named "gpg".

  It is no longer possible to specify the location of the gpg binary at
  buildtime to differentiate between version 1.x and version 2.x.  The port
  options GNUPG1 and GNUPG2 now merely add their respective versions of gnupg
  as build and runtime dependencies.

20140618:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/m17n-* textproc/*m17n*
  AUTHOR: Nikola Lecic <nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net>

  devel/m17n-db now incorporates a set of user-contributed input methods and

  Delete textproc/m17n-contrib first and then update/install devel/m17n-db.

20140616:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: lev@FreeBSD.org

  The subversion port has been overhauled. Some optional parts were extracted
  into separate ports. These ports are:

  www/mod_dav_svn
    instead of option MOD_DAV_SVN.
  security/subversion-gnome-keyring
    instead of option GNOME_KEYRING.
  security/subversion-kwallet
    instead of option KDE_KWALLET.

  If you used devel/subversion with one (or more) of these non-standard
  options, you should install the appropriate port(s) after upgrading
  subversion.

  "mod_dontdothat" is installed unconditionally by www/mod_dav_svn port (it
  depended on the TOOLS option before), but is not activated by default, you
  may need to edit apache's configuration file.

  The devel/subversion port now installs svndiff, svndiff3 and svndiff4
  commands if TOOLS option is enabled. They was skipped before.
  The official names "diff", "diff3" and "diff4" are prefixed with "svn" to
  avoid conflicts with base and other diff versions.

  All libraries and binaries are now stripped if the MAINTAINER_DEBUG
  option is not selected (including all sub-ports, like bindings
  and mod_dav_svn).

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba4 port now re-uses the same logic and startup script as Samba41. So,
  to get net/samba4 runing you need to rename samba4_enable in /etc/rc.conf
  to the samba_sever_enable.

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140416:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg graphics/dri graphics/libGL and related ports
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD 10-STABLE and
  FreeBSD 9-STABLE.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg ports but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  For users in need of working console when using KMS drivers (intel and
  radeon graphics cards) please use the new vt(9) console driver.
  For more information, see https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics and
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/Newcons .

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL

  lang/dmd and lang/dmd2 have switched places. Dmd 1.x is no longer supported
  by digitalmars.com and is now the secondary dmd port in the collection.
  Dmd2 is the primary port. What this means to dmd users is that dmd1 is now
  used to invoke dmd 1.x and the dmd command (instead of dmd2) now invokes
  dmd 2.x.

20140413:
  AFFECTS: users of Python and pkg >= 1.2.7_1
  AUTHOR: koobs@FreeBSD.org

  There have been reports of the following error when upgrading Python ports:

    pkg-static: Plist error, directory listed as a file: <name>.egg-info

  The cause is an outdated or unpatched version of setuptools or distribute
  installed by the user, or leftover from previous upgrades being used during
  the `setup.py install` phase. pkg >= 1.2.7_1 now generates an error where
  previously it did not.

  Users should inspect their ${LOCALBASE}/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
  directory, and remove any entries that reference versions of
  setuptools or distribute *not* provided by ports or packages.

  Examples of entries that may be removed are:

    1) distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg
    2) setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg
    3) *Any* version of setuptools directly from PyPI via pip or easy_install

  The Apache PHP module has been separated from the main PHP port.
  If you had the APACHE OPTION selected, you have to perform the
  following steps:

  1) update your lang/php* options (i.e. 'make config')
  2) rebuild lang/php* port
  3) install www/mod_php* port

  It is *mandatory* to build both ports with the same DEBUG and ZTS
  options, so if you have a threaded Apache (i.e. worker or event MPM)
  you have to select the ZTS option in lang/php* port.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-setuptools dependent ports
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  devel/py-setuptools is being used for every python ports (if USE_PYDISTUTILS
  defined) since r336553. Due to PKGORIGIN limitation, we cannot build one
  python port with python27 and the other with python33 since they require
  different setuptools versions which have same PKGORIGIN. With the addition
  of py-setuptools{27,32,33}, we could now have py27-foo and py33-bar coexist
  in one system.

  Note that this is only a short-term solution. It does not help if you need
  coexistence of one port with different python versions, e.g. py27-foo and
  py33-foo.

  Please rebuild all ports that depend on devel/py-setuptools and use
  devel/py-setuptools{27,32,33} instead.

  XX represents python version (27, 32 or 33) in the following steps.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools:devel/py-setuptoolsXX

  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/docbook-* ports have been consolidated into two ports
  textproc/docbook-sgml and textproc/docbook-xml.

  Before upgrading you should force the removal of the existing ports, they
  will conflict with the new ones.

  pkg users can run:

    pkg delete -f docbook-xml\* docbook-sk\* docbook\[2345\]\?\?-\* docbook-4\*

  the other users can run:

    pkg_delete -f docbook-xml\* docbook-sk\* docbook\[2345\]\?\?-\* docbook-4\*

  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.12.2. kdeadmin, kdenetwork, kdesdk,
  and kdetoys ports have been split due to upstream changes.

  KDE Workspace port has been updated to 4.11.6. It requires modern
  Mesa libraries, provided by WITH_NEW_XORG knob. To update Xorg ports
  to newer version follow instructions at https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics

20140218:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/kdehier4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE4_PREFIX has been changed from /usr/local/kde4 to /usr/local.
  All ports that depends on kdehier4 must be reinstalled.
  PORTREVISION for affected ports has been increased, upgrading tools
  (portmaster, pkg) should handle this update without manual intervention.
  Please check /usr/local/kde4 for leftovers after upgrade. If you don't
  have locally modified files, e.g. under /usr/local/kde4/etc, you may
  safely remove /usr/local/kde4.

20140214:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl 5.12 has been removed.  The default Perl is lang/perl5.16.

  pkg(8) users:
    1) Update the origin to point to 5.16:
       pkg set -o lang/perl5.12:lang/perl5.16

    2) Upgrade perl and all dependencies:
       pkg install -Rf lang/perl5.16

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
       pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
       portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f lang/perl5.12

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
       portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

    Conservative:
      portmaster p5-

    Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
      portmaster -r perl-

    Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port specify the name of
      the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.  Also, depending on when
      perl 5.12 was installed last, the prefix may be perl-, perl5- or
      perl5.12-.

20140113:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba41
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  With the introduction of Samba 4.1 corresponding port lost SWAT support
  and made WINBIND support mandatory. As samba4 introduced additional 'samba'
  daemon to the tripplet of nmbd/smbd/winbindd to avoid confusion startup
  script for samba41 was renamed to 'samba_server'. To start the whole band
  up it's enough to add to the rc.conf:

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140112:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libical
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The libical port was updated to 1.0.0. Due to the shared library bump
  and the removal of the .la file, all ports that use libical need to be
  rebuilt.

  # portmaster -r libical

  AUTHOR: jlaffaye@FreeBSD.org

  Third party Go packages installed via the ports tree are no longer installed
  in GOROOT (PREFIX/go) but in a specific path: PREFIX/share/go

  Affected ports had their PORTREVISION bumped.
  To reinstall these packages via the ports tree, it is needed to deinstall
  them first (the build will fail if the `go` command detects that they
  already exists in GOROOT).

  If you are using these third party Go packages for local Go development,
  you have to add this new path to your GOPATH environment variable.

  The MINIMAL and MODULES options have been removed from archivers/p7zip,
  which now unconditionally installs the 7z, 7za and 7zr, as if the MINIMAL
  option was previously unset.

  The RAR decompression codec, whose source code has a more restrictive

  AFFECTS: users of databases/ruby-bdb or ports-mgmt/portupgrade and databases/db5 or databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  databases/db5 and databases/db6 have recently been updated to fix
  bugs. This changed their patchlevel version.

  However, ruby-bdb used to break during the db[56] upgrade due to a bug
  described in <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=184921>.

  THEREFORE, YOU MUST MANUALLY UPGRADE databases/ruby-bdb INDIVIDUALLY
  TO 0.6.6_2 OR NEWER WHEN USING portupgrade AGAINST databases/db[56]
  PORTS. To achieve that, type:

  # portupgrade databases/ruby-bdb
  or
  # portmaster -x 'db*' databases/ruby-bdb

  before proceeding with other upgrades.

  Should you have corrupted the portupgrade databases, or if ruby-bdb
  refuses to work with the upgraded db* port with errors such as "DB
  needs compatible versions of libdb & db.h", then rebuild the ruby-bdb
  port manually, and fix the portupgrade databases:

  # make -C /usr/ports/databases/ruby-bdb all deinstall install clean
  # pkgdb -fu
  # portupgrade -f db5 db6

  This should return portupgrade to normal operation.

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg, graphics/libGL, graphics/dri, all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD CURRENT.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg port but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    and then
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Berkeley DB versions before and excluding 4.8 have been marked deprecated.
  New port installations should be based on Berkeley DB 5 or 6.

  Note that Oracle Berkeley DB 6 is under the more restrictive Affero GPL v3
  license, be sure to review if using that fits your requirements.

  You can add WITH_BDB_VER=5 or WITH_BDB_VER=6 to /etc/make.conf to have all
  applications that get rebuilt use Oracle Berkeley DB 5 or 6, respectively.

  DO NOT FORCE DELETE older BerkeleyDB packages, that breaks the upgrade
  tools.  Instead, first rebuild the ports that depend on it, then
  remove the old Berkeley DB versions.

  Berkeley DB ports should be able to build/install with an older and a
  newer version version both installed if WITH_BDB_VER is set.  If a
  port then grabs the old Berkeley DB version, that is an issue with the
  port that requires Berkeley DB, and should be reported to the
  maintainer.

  If you are interested in upgrading now already, we have instructions
  at <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The THREADS option has been enabled by default in all Perl. If you're using
  binary packages you need to do :

    # pkg install -Rf perl5

  If you're not using binary packages, and want to switch from non threaded
  Perl to threaded Perl, you need to recompile and reinstall most ports
  depending on Perl. Supposing you have Perl 5.16, you would do:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: The installed Perl package was named perl and is now named perl5, if
	you have not updated your installation in a long time, you may need to
	use "perl-" here.

  AFFECTS: users of dns/nsd
  AUTHOR: erwin@FreeBSD.org

  dns/nsd was updated to the new 4.0.0 major release.

  This version replaces the nsdc control program with nsd-control.
  This requires some manual setup with nsd-control-setup and editing
  of the config files. nsd-control is incompatible with nsdc so when
  that is used in scripts, these should be adapted.  More information:
  http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/svn/nsd/tags/NSD_4_0_0_REL/doc/NSD-4-features

  NSD version 3 is still supported in dns/nsd3.  To keep the old
  version:
  # portmaster -o dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # portupgrade -fo dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # pkg set -o dns/nsd:dns/nsd3

  no longer supported out of the box.

  For users of FreeBSD 9.x and earlier, the LINKS option is no longer
  enabled by default, but still supported.  No other changes should
  affect those users, and updating without changing already set options
  will keep the system in the same state.

  AFFECTS: 10-CURRENT users with any port depending on converters/libiconv
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  10-CURRENT after r254273 (committed on August 13, 2013) has an
  implementation of iconv enabled by default in libc.

  NOTE: after r341775 (committed on January 29, 2014) and other
  following commits, a few ports, including devel/glib20, depend
  on the converters/libiconv again due to missing functionality in the
  base iconv implementation.

  Due to this change some major overhauling of the ports tree has
  been necessary to move the ports to using that implementation.

  People using pkgng binary packages should have little problems,
  "pkg upgrade" will update all software to not depend on libiconv
  anymore, once updated packages are available. Please make sure to
  perform a "pkg autoremove" after that and check that libiconv is
  correctly removed by it.

  If you are using ports the update requires some manual intervention.
  The following procedure should be followed:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update
  # pkg delete -f libiconv
  # cat ports_to_update | xargs portmaster

  or:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update
  # pkg delete -f libiconv
  # cat ports_to_update | xargs portupgrade -f

  The on disk format has changed.
  Please make sure that queue is empty before you update.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/python*
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/python* ports do not install links to 2to3, idle, pydoc, python
  and other binaries anymore. Those were moved into the lang/python2 and
  lang/python3 ports respectively. This change brings us closer to the goal
  of making Python ports usable with different Python versions at the same
  time.

  If you have lang/python2* or lang/python3* installed, please also install
  the associated lang/python2 or lang/python3 port.

  1. update lang/python2* and/or lang/python3*
  2. install lang/python2 and/or lang/python3
  3. install/update lang/python

20130816:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opendx and math/octave-forge-octcdf
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  These two ports have changed the science/netcdf dependency to
  science/netcdf4.  It is recommended that the science/netcdf package
  be deinstalled before rebuilding these ports, otherwise you are likely
  to face port conflicts when building future ports.

20130806:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/eric4
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  Since PKGVERSION=4.5.13_1 the default file destination has changed from
  ${PYTHON_SITELIBDIR}/eric4 to ${DATADIR}.

20130731:
  AFFECTS: users of glib20
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/gio-fam-backend port was removed in the glib 2.36 update.
  Since the gio-fam-backend port was used in USE_GNOME=glib20, all
  dependencies need to be rebuilt. The removal of gio-fam-backend isn't
  critical, glib20 using programs should work just fine if the port is still
  installed. It is not clear however, if glib20 will use the new kqueue
  backend or the old fam backend.

  Note that users of pkg packages can just run the pkg delete command after
  their next update.

  # portmaster -r gio-fam-backend
  # pkg_delete gio-fam-backend-\* (for pkgng: pkg delete gio-fam-backend)
  # portmaster -a

    or

  # portupgrade -rf gio-fam-backend
  # pkg_delete gio-fam-backend-\* (for pkgng: pkg delete gio-fam-backend)

  AFFECTS: users of Qt 3 and KDE 3
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  All ports based on Qt 3 (including KDE 3 but also ports which used Qt 3
  as a graphical toolkit) expired on 20130701 because Qt 3 and KDE 3 were
  no longer maintained upstream.  These ports have been removed today.

  Users of KDE 3 are advised to switch to another desktop environment
  provided in the Ports Collection, e.g. KDE 4 or Xfce.

  Users of Qt 3 are advised to upgrade to the Qt 4 counterpart(s).

  AFFECTS: users of net/openafs
  AUTHOR: bjk@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenAFS 1.6.5 release is a security release which requires substantial
  configuration changes to the AFS servers in addition to the software update,
  in order to be fully protected.  The entry for OPENAFS-SA-2013-003 on
  http://www.openafs.org/security/ has links to the upgrade documentation.
  The procedure involves rekeying the cell to a non-DES krb5 key, stored in
  a krb5 keytab named rxkad.keytab in PREFIX/etc/openafs/server/.

  AFFECTS: users of japanese/mozc-server and japanese/mozc-el
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The bin/mozc_emacs_helper program is now built and installed by
  japanese/mozc-server because the build processes are heavily
  overlapped with each other and the helper program does not depend on
  most of what mozc-server does actually.  To upgrade them, please remove
  mozc-el first to prevent a conflict with the installed bin/mozc_emacs_helper.

  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The logcheck port now provides a configuration option controlling
  installation of the crontab file. When installing the port interactively,
  the port option is enabled by default to mimic previous behavior.

  When the port is installed non-interactively (BATCH=yes) the crontab
  file *will not* be installed automatically. If the EXAMPLES port option
  is enabled, the crontab file can be installed manually at a later time
  from EXAMPLESDIR/crontab.in.

  AFFECTS: users of www/zend-framework
  AUTHOR: wg@FreeBSD.org

  zend-framework has been updated to 2.2.1 and old 1.12.0 has been copied
  to www/zend-framework1. If you wish to stay with the older version run:

  # portmaster -o www/zend-framework1 www/zend-framework
    or
  # portupgrade -fo www/zend-framework1 www/zend-framework
    or
  # pkg set -o www/zend-framework:www/zend-framework1

  AFFECTS: users of net/avahi-gtk
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  Avahi was updated to 0.6.31, due to changes in the avahi-gtk port it will
  be necessary to remove the avahi-gtk port before updating.
  Users of pkg packages can skip this step.

  # pkg_delete -f avahi-gtk\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f avahi-gtk

20130711:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/py-ldns
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The dns/py-ldns port now only installs the Python bits, and depends on
  dns/ldns.  Because of that, you cannot just do a regular upgrade, it
  would install dns/ldns overwriting existing files and removing them when
  removing the old version of dns/py-ldns.

  # pkg_delete -f py-ldns-\*
  # cd /usr/ports/dns/py-ldns && make clean && make install clean
    or
  # pkg delete -fg py-ldns-\*
  # pkg install -f dns/py-ldns

  AFFECTS: users of www/ajaxplorer
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Ajaxplorer was updated to 5.0.1. This is a major update and some
  manual intervention may be needed.

  Before upgrading you should preserve the following files in WWWDIR
  (defaults to PREFIX/www/ajaxplorer) if you have customized them:

  conf/bootstrap_conf.php
  conf/bootstrap_context.php
  conf/bootstrap_plugins.php
  conf/bootstrap_repositories.php

  and put them back after the upgrade.

  If you are using a database backend you will need to manually
  update your database table using the sql script the port will
  install at WWWDIR/conf/conf/4.2.3-5.0.0-db-upgrade.sql

  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The KDE Software Compilation 4.10.4 was committed a few days ago, and
  version 4.10.5 was committed today.

  They include better support for using clang as the compiler, but that
  requires recompiling all KDE ports which depend on x11/kdelibs4. Most
  ports which fall into this category are already part of the KDE Software
  Compilation and have been updated to version 4.10.5, but those released
  separately need to be rebuilt manually.

  If you are building your KDE ports with clang, doing the following is
  recommended:

  # portmaster -r kdelibs-4\*
    or
  # portupgrade -fr x11/kdelibs4
    or
  # pkg install -fR x11/kdelibs4

  Alternatively, to avoid rebuilding the ports which are part of the 4.10.5
  update:

  # portmaster -x \*-4.10.5\* -r kdelibs-4\*
    or
  # portupgrade -x \*-4.10.5\* -fr x11/kdelibs4

  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Since June 22nd, portmaster no longer relies on 'WITH_PKGNG' to be defined,
  or ports to be checked out to enable pkgng support.

  It now considers whether or not pkg is installed and registered with itself.

  I.e., if this returns data, pkgng is considered in use:

    # pkg info pkg

  It's possible that you may have tested pkgng in the past, ran pkg2ng, and
  never fully committed to it by setting WITH_PKGNG. If this is the case,
  uninstall pkg with pkg_info/pkg_delete and also remove the stale database,
  rm /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite.

  This could manifest itself as portmaster -L showing the wrong versions, or
  portmaster no longer detecting installed packages correctly.

  Note that PORTS still require WITH_PKGNG=yes in make.conf if you are not
  running CURRENT.

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba36
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba has updated format of it's printing tdbs (ntprinting.tdb, ntforms.tdb,
  ntdrivers.tdb) to include character encoding. When updating from Samba 3.5
  or earlier to Samba 3.6 or 4.0 these tdbs need to be migrated to new registry
  based printing management. This implies also character conversion.

  You have to specify the correct code page for the conversion, see iconv -l.
  The mostly used one is Windows Latin1 which is CP1252.

  You can correctly view the tdb with:

  # net printing dump encoding=CP1252 /path/to/ntprinters.tdb

  or migrate it with e.g.:

  # net printing migrate encoding=CP1252 /path/to/ntprinters.tdb

  If you migrate printers it is suggest to do it in the following order:

  ntforms.tdb
  ntdrivers.tdb
  ntprinting.tdb

  Don't forget to rename, move or delete these files in /var/db/samba after
  the migration.

  net-im/mikutter003 has been removed from the ports tree because the
  Twitter API version 1.0 was deprecated on 2013-05-07 and mikutter003,
  which uses the API 1.0, won't work.
  Please consider using net-im/mikutter instead of this.

  AFFECTS: users of www/magento
  AUTHOR: melvyn@magemana.nl

  Magento has been updated to 1.7.0.2 on 2013-06-03. With it a stricter file
  system policy is enforced on the port. If you (or your customer) rely heavily
  on Magento Connect via the backend to install extensions, your quickfix is:

  # chown -R www: ${PREFIX}/www/magento
  # chmod -R u+w ${PREFIX}/www/magento

  The more conservative approach:
  # chown -R www: ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/code/{local,community} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/{design,locale} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/{downloader,skin}

  # chmod -R u+w ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/code/{local,community} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/{design,locale} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/{downloader,skin}

  The conservative approach will alert you to extensions that try to write in
  Magento core, while allowing clean extensions to install properly (corner
  cases may exist).

20130619:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  devel/subversion has been upgraded from 1.7.10 to 1.8.0

  If you want to upgrade, and use http/https access to repositories,
  please check, that the SERF option is enabled, as NEON support
  is gone. Also, mod_dontdothat and svnauthz_validate are
  now enabled with one option TOOLS, among other new tools
  and SVNMUCC is enabled always.

  subversion-1.7.x is available as devel/subversion17

  To stay on subversion-1.7.x set in /etc/make.conf
  WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=17
  and use the following command

  # pkg set -o devel/subversion:devel/subversion17
    or

20130614:
  AFFECTS: users who set port options in make.conf
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  Configuring options in make.conf using variables like OPTIONS_SET and
  OPTIONS_UNSET now also suppresses the option dialog for those options.
  This means that when building a port the option dialog will only appear if
  there are truly new options that have not been configured before using either
  the dialog or make.conf.  This allows you to set options like DOCS, NLS,
  X11, etc. once for all ports and not have option dialogs pop up if those are
  the only options.  For a list of variables you can set in make.conf to
  control options see Mk/bsd.options.mk.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby18
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 1.8 to 1.9. First, stop any

  on ruby:

  If you use portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby19 lang/ruby18
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-1.9

  If you use portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby18
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby19 # if you have it installed
  # portupgrade -f ports-mgmt/portupgrade
  # portupgrade -x ruby-1.8.\* -fr lang/ruby18

  After these steps are complete, you can pkg_delete ruby 1.8 if you
  no longer need it.

  If you use pkgng:
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby18:lang/ruby19
  # pkg install -fR lang/ruby19

  If you wish to keep the 1.8 version as default, add the following lines
  to your /etc/make.conf file:

  AFFECTS: users of textproc/elasticsearch
  AUTHOR: tj@FreeBSD.org

  This is the first stable release based on Lucene 4. We recommend testing
  the upgrade before doing it in production.

  Upgrading from 0.20 requires a full cluster restart.

  In order to be able to downgrade, stop indexing new data, issue a flush
  request, do the upgrade and only enable indexing of new data once you
  are certain that you no longer need to downgrade.  Once new data has
  been indexed, downgrading is no longer possible. To be extra safe, back
  up your data before upgrading.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/hs-git-annex
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  On FreeBSD, git-annex incorrectly calculated SHA256 hashes for files
  added to the annex repository due to the BSD-style output of
  /sbin/sha256.  The result of this is silent data corruption.

  This problem has been fixed, but every file stored in an annex
  repository will fail a `git-annex fsck` after the upgrade.  Thus,
  before updating, it is wise to issue the command below and restore the
  files.

  $ git-annex uninit

  Corruptions can then be found by finding all files with the same hash.
  Note that only files that were mishashed to the same location are a
  problem.

  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  One can now choose TeXLive or teTeX by using TEX_DEFAULT.
  Specifying TEX_DEFAULT=texlive, almost all of ports which use TeX
  will install and depend on TeXLive-based ones.  Note that the
  default value is still "tetex" and the two cannot coexist.  You need

  AFFECTS: users of TeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  TeXLive ports have been imported.  Although most of ports still depend
  on teTeX at this moment, they will be converted to use TeXLive.

  The directory layout of them is as follows.  Please use print/texlive-full
  if you are not familiar with how each component works.  Finer-grained
  ports will be added (specifically, meta ports for smaller installation
  and so on).  Note that the full installation needs around 3GB of disk space.

  teTeX-based ports and TeXLive are mutually exclusive.  This means TeXLive
  ports cannot be installed when teTeX is already installed.  You need
  to remove all of the TeX-related packages based on teTeX to try TeXLive.
  Migration procedure will be announced when conversion of the port
  dependency is completed.

  * Meta port
   - print/texlive-full: meta port to install all of the TeXLive components

  * Libraries
   - devel/tex-kpathsea: kpathsea library
   - devel/tex-web2c: WEB2C toolchain and TeX engines
   - print/tex-ptexenc: character code conversion library for pTeX

  check -Ba' and 'pkg upgrade' on their servers once. This will allow the new
  shlib tracking to reinstall packages that have changed shlib requirements.

  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The affected ports have been converted to use libpaper for the default paper
  size as print/psutils did.  For more detail, see 20130424 below.

20130424:
  AFFECTS: users of print/psutils-a4 or print/psutils-letter
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/psutils-a4 and print/psutils-letter have been merged into a single port
  print/psutils.  The default paper size in psnup(1), psresize(1), and
  pstops(1) is now selected via an environment variable and/or a configuration
  file of libpaper(3).  For more detail, see papersize(5) and paperconfig(8)
  manual page.    If you prefer A4 or letter size by default as the old
  version did, please install print/papersize-default-a4 or
  print/papersize-default-letter, which installs a papersize configuration
  file without manual configuration.

  AFFECTS: users of */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  Due to some unexpected dynamic linking problems, Haskell Cabal ports with
  binaries that link to their own libraries may not work.  With default
  configuration, the following ports are known to have this problem:
  Agda, BNFC, pandoc, and uuagc.  (Their port revision are now bumped.)

  In general, it is recommended to rebuild the port if you are
  experiencing that the corresponding binary will not start, e.g.:

  % agda
  Shared object "libHSAgda-2.3.2-ghc7.4.2.so" not found, required by "agda"

  AFFECTS: users of converters/libiconv and devel/gettext
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  libiconv now handles the lib/charset.alias file instead of devel/gettext.
  If you are using pkgng 'and' upgrading from source with portupgrade or
  portmaster, first delete gettext, upgrade libiconv, then reinstall gettext.

  This will break sudo, so you *must* do this in a root shell (sudo -i)
  if you use sudo.

  # pkg delete -f devel/gettext
  # portmaster converters/libiconv devel/gettext
    or
  # pkg delete -f devel/gettext

20130218:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4-devel
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  The port was renamed into net/samba4 and is going to replace older
  development version of Samba4. You can upgrade it with:

  # portmaster -o net/samba4 net/samba4-devel

  In case you want to upgrade from net/samba36 make sure, that you've
  made backup of /usr/local/etc/smb.conf and the content of /var/db/samba/
  directory.

  There is no direct upgrade path from Samba3 to Samba4, but you can
  always try:

  # portmaster -o net/samba4 net/samba36

  Make sure you've read instructions from the supplied README.FreeBSD
  file and read all the relevant pages on http://wiki.samba.org/

  We still miss necessary support for Samba4 from base ntpd and bind9,
  port versions are also are not ready yet, but been worked on.

  Please note, that Samba4 is still in it's early days, so there are
  bugs both from my side and it's own, so be careful with placing it
  into production.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  Note that the recent devel/libffi update caused some breakage in the Haskell
  ports with the DYNAMIC option enabled.  The problem has been identified and
  fixed since then.  All Haskell ports have been updated to their latest stable

20130202:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: rm@FreeBSD.org

  deluge port had switched to using libtorrent-rasterbar 0.16 as backend. Since
  both of the versions of libtorrent are conflicting with each other, you need
  to deinstall libtorrent-rasterbar-15 and libtorrent-rasterbar-15-python first
  and then update deluge as usual. Please also keep in mind, that deluge does
  not work via http-proxy when libtorrent-rasterbar 0.16 is used.

20130113:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  security/openvpn has been upgraded to the IPv6-capable v2.3.0.
  This upgrade moves easy-rsa into a separate package in
  security/easy-rsa that is pre-selected as default run-time dependency,
  and changes installed file layout a bit.

  security/openvpn22 retains the prior OpenVPN 2.2.2 version.
  If you want to continue using this version, use one of these commands:

  # portmaster -o security/openvpn22 security/openvpn
    or
  # portupgrade -o security/openvpn22 security/openvpn

20130108:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libvanessa_socket, mail/perdition
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  The update of devel/libvanessa_socket to 0.0.12 (used by Perdition)
  adds IPv6 support.  If the hostname in bind_address has both IPv4 and
  IPv6 addresses in DNS, then Perdition will ONLY listen on IPv6.

  If you prefer to continue to use IPv4, you need to change the
  bind_address in /usr/local/etc/perdition/perdition.conf to use an
  explicit IPv4 address.  This can be in addition to, or instead of,
  the current hostname, depending on whether you want to use IPv6 or
  not.  If your Perdition server does not have an IPv6 address
  listed in DNS, this change does not affect you.

20130108:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cfengine*
  AUTHOR: gjb@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/cfengine has been created as a master port for the set of
  sysutils/cfengine* ports.  Users interested in tracking the latest
  stable branch of cfengine should update their port origins to use
  the new port, for example:

  # portmaster -o sysutils/cfengine sysutils/cfengine33
    or
  # portupgrade -fo sysutils/cfengine sysutils/cfengine33
    or
  # pkg set -o sysutils/cfengine33:sysutils/cfengine

  Users that switch their port origin and later wish to remain on
  a particular cfengine release can override the default version by
  adding CFENGINE_VERSION to /etc/make.conf, where CFENGINE_VERSION
  is a value from:

    # make -V VERSIONS

20130103:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/docproj*
  AUTHOR: doceng@FreeBSD.org

  textproc/docproj no longer requires WITH_JADETEX to be set to 'yes' or
  'no', and by default, will enable the JADETEX dependencies.

  The textproc/docproj-jadetex port has been removed as a result of this
  change.

  Users that have installed textproc/docproj and have set
  WITH_JADETEX=no during compile time should update the package origin
  to use textproc/docproj-nojadetex:

  # portmaster -o textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-nojadetex
  or
  # portupgrade -fo textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-nojadetex
  or
  # pkg set -o textproc/docproj-nojadetex:textproc/docproj

  Users that have installed textproc/docproj-jadetex should update the
  package origin to use the textproc/docproj port:

  # portmaster -o textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-jadetex
  or
  # portupgrade -fo textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-jadetex
  or
  # pkg set -o textproc/docproj-jadetex:textproc/docproj

  Users that have installed textproc/docproj and have set
  WITH_JADETEX=yes will not need to make any changes.

  AFFECTS: users of audio/baresip
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Baresip is tightly linked to the versions of audio/re and audio/rem, and
  will not build against different versions.

  To update without problems, the -R flag for portupgrade is mandatory, or
  build will fail.  Portmaster and pkgng will handle this correctly.

20130103:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  VirtualBox has been updated and does now depend on devel/kBuild instead
  of devel/kBuild-devel. Both are in conflict with each other so this has
  to be resolved manually. kBuild is only a build dependency so it is safe
  to remove installed kBuild before updating.

  # pkg_delete -f kBuild-\*

20130102:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd

  ===>  p5-DBD-mysql-4.021 conflicts with installed package(s):
        p5-DBD-mysql55-4.021

  To prevent this run one of the following commands to fix the

  AFFECTS: users of CURRENT (OSVERSION >= 1000017)
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  The ports tree is now using pkgng as the default package manager
  for HEAD.  This only affects users of CURRENT -- users of other
  branches need not take any action.

  To keep pkg_install as the default package manager, use the new
  WITHOUT_PKGNG knob in make.conf

  To make the switch:

  1) Set WITHOUT_PKGNG=yes in make.conf and upgrade all your ports to
  the latest available versions using your favourite tools.

  2) Install ports-mgmt/pkg

  3) Remove WITHOUT_PKGNG from make.conf and run:

  # pkg_delete -f fcitx-keyboard-\*

  And make sure you have at least one keyboard layout based input method
  enabled in fcitx-configtool, to keep the activation/deactivation of IM
  panel working.

  And, since chinese/fcitx-sunpinyin depends on an update to
  chinese/sunpinyin

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/ImageMagick and graphics/ImageMagick-nox11
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The options for ImageMagick have been changed to match commonly used
  option names. If you are using a customized build, please reconfigure
  your port options with "make config".

20120720:
  AFFECTS: users of net/spread and net/spread4
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  AFFECTS: users of mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mutt-devel has been moved to mail/mutt, since 1.5 has been around
  for a while.

  Should you wish to stick with version 1.4 at this time;

  # portmaster -o mail/mutt14 mutt

20120721:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/libogg
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  There is a new version of libogg (1.3.0) and the shared library version
  has been bumped (ogg.7 to ogg.8).  All ports that have an identifiable
  direct dependency on this library have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.
  However, some ports that pull in the library indirectly may continue to
  look for the old version.  To ensure that all are updated, perform this
  step:

  # portmaster -r libogg
  or
  # portupgrade -rf libogg

20120717:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The options of ProFTPD have been made much more user-friendly.
  As the modules are all shared libraries, all possible modules are built
  and installed. The following modules are now in separate slave ports:

  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_odbc: mod_sql_odbc
  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_sqlite: mod_sql_sqlite
  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_tds: mod_sql_tds
  net/proftpd-mod_ldap: mod_ldap and mod_quotatab_ldap

20120716:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The following port options have been reorganized:
  The OPENLDAP option has been renamed to LDAP.
  The MAGNET and CML options have been withdrawn in favor of new LUA option.

20120716:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  The postscreen-to-smtpd protocol has changed.  To avoid "cannot
  receive connection attributes" warnings and dropped connections,
  execute the command "postfix reload".

20120716:
  AFFECTS: Nobody
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  The FreeBSD ports tree switched from CVS to Subversion. A Subversion
  to CVS exporter is in place to continue the support of CVSup.

20120709:
  AFFECTS: users of math/metis
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  The older version of metis has been moved to math/metis4, and
  math/metis has been updated to 5.0.2.  Dependent ports still use
  the old API, and the different versions of metis cannot coexist, so
  most users should update with:

  # portmaster -o math/metis4 math/metis
  # portmaster -r math/metis4

  or the equivalent.

20120702:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/couchdb
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org, Adam Strohl <adams-ports@ateamsystems.com>

  The couchdb port has an unfortunate side effect; versions before 1.2.0
  will clobber local.ini.  The port will refuse to build if that file is
  present and an earlier version is installed, however no such protection
  can be afforded to package installation.

  To upgrade from 1.1.0 and earlier, simply move PREFIX/etc/couchdb/local.ini
  out of the way until the upgrade is complete.

20120702:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/mikutter
  AUTHOR: tota@FreeBSD.org

  The net-im/mikutter has been updated to 0.1.1.810 which is required
  Ruby 1.9.2 or later. Before upgrading this port, please see the entry
  20110822 in this file to upgrade Ruby to 1.9.

  If you want to stay with 0.0.3 (requires Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2 or later),
  please run the following command:

  # portmaster -o net-im/mikutter003 net-im/mikutter
    or
  # portupgrade -o net-im/mikutter003 net-im/mikutter

20120630:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.16 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.12, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f perl-5.12.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

  The default version for Perl has also been changed from 5.12 to 5.14.

20120623:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/xfce4-utils
  AUTHOR: xfce@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been discontinued, and installs files that conflict with
  the new versions of misc/xfce4-appfinder and x11-wm/xfce4-session.

  # pkg_delete -f xfce4-utils-\*
  # portmaster misc/xfce4-appfinder x11-wm/xfce4-session

20120618:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db5
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/db5 port has been upgraded to BerkeleyDB 5.3.  This
  entails a shared library bump.

  Before upgrading this port, check if your applications use
  transactional data bases, and if they do, prepare them for a log file
  format upgrade.  YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE YOU UPGRADE THE DB5 PORT!  See:
  http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_02/html/upgrading/upgrade_process.html

  All packages that depend on db5 need to be rebuilt due to the shared
  library version change.  The full changelog is at
  http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/products/berkeleydb/html/changelog_5_3.html

  To upgrade the packages that need Berkeley DB 5, please
  issue one of the following commands (depending on your preferred tool):

  # portmaster -r db5-5
    or
  # portupgrade -fr databases/db5

20120616:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The lighttpd startup script has been changed and is now compatible to the
  apache startup script. The "reload" subcommand now sends a SIGHUP to the
  process and triggers cycling of log files. The new command "graceful"
  performs a graceful restart (similar to former "reload") and "gracefulstop"
  performs a graceful stop. The "check" command has been replaced with
  the "configtest" command.

20120615:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/akonadi
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The latest Akonadi update includes critical bug fixes. Manual
  intervention is required for people using local MySQL database (the
  default configuration) as backend:

  $ akonadictl stop

  Wait a bit, and make sure that akonadiserver and akonadi_control are
  not running. Kill them if needed. Then, you have two alternatives:

  $ mysql_install_db --force \
    --defaults-file=~/.local/share/akonadi/mysql.conf \
    --datadir=~/.local/share/akonadi/db_data \
    --basedir=$(dirname `dirname $(which mysql_install_db)`)
  $ rm ~/.local/share/akonadi/mysql.conf

  ...or...

  $ rm -r ~/.local/share/akonadi

  In the latter case, Akonadi will have to recache your personal data
  (might take a while). Akonadi is only a cache, no data will be lost.
  Then:

  $ akonadictl start

20120613:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/djvulibre and graphics/djvulibre-nox11
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  DjVuLibre been updated to 3.5.25.3.  The Qt 3.x GUI support that was in
  graphics/djvulibre has been removed (users of this GUI should consider
  switching to the new Qt 4.x GUI in graphics/djview4), and
  graphics/djvulibre-nox11 has been merged back into graphics/djvulibre.
  To update DjVuLibre, you can use:

  # pkg_delete djvulibre-\?.\*
  # portmaster -o graphics/djvulibre djvulibre-nox11

  You should then update any installed ports that link to the djvulibre shared
  library: converters/pdf2djvu, graphics/djview4, graphics/okular, and --
  if optional djvulibre support was enabled -- graphics/ImageMagick,
  graphics/apvlv, and graphics/evince.

20120612:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql-libpqxx
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  postgresql-libpqxx has been updated to 4.0. If you want to stick
  with version 3, install postgresql-libpqxx30:

  # portmaster -o databases/postgresql-libpqxx30 postgresql-libpqxx

20120612:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/gdal
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Language bindings (Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby) were moved to separate
  ports. Please install them if required. The new ports are:

    Perl binding:   graphics/p5-Geo-GDAL
    PHP binding:    graphics/php-gdal
    Python binding: graphics/py-gdal
    Ruby binding:   graphics/ruby-gdal

20120605:
  AFFECTS: users of net/p5-ZConf
  AUTHOR: vvelox@vvelox.net

  Please append '.set' to all sets for the FS backend. This was done to prevent
  collisions between config and set names. Previously the config
  "someConfig/default" would collide with the set "default" for "someConfig".

20120603:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  Note that The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler and the Haskell Platform
  have been updated to versions 7.4.1 and 2012.2.0.0, respectively.  At the
  same time, all Haskell ports have been updated to their latest working
  versions.

  To follow the changes, please issue one of the following commands
  (depending on the tool used):

  # portmaster -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

20120531:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/png

  The PNG library has been updated to version 1.5.10.  Please rebuild all
  ports that depend on it.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -r png-
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr graphics/png

20120531:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/koffice-kde4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KOffice 2 has been replaced by Calligra. You are encouraged to
  deinstall any KOffice port and install equivalent Calligra ones:

  # pkg_delete \*koffice\*
  # portmaster editors/calligra <additional l10n ports>

20120530:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql*-server
  AUTHOR: jgh@FreeBSD.org

  Affected users are those who use the crypt(text, text) function with
  DES encryption in the optional pg_crypto module. Passwords affected
  are those that contain characters that cannot be represented with
  7-bit ASCII. If a password contains a character that has the most
  significant bit set (0x80), and DES encryption is used, that character
  and all characters after it will be ignored.

20120530:
  AFFECTS: users of net/nss-pam-ldapd
  AUTHOR: scheidell@FreeBSD.org

  The net/nss-pam-ldapd port no longer provides an option for SASL. This has
  been sourced out to the new net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl port, to accommodate
  users using packages (see ports/162240). Users with openldap-sasl-client
  installed are encouraged to change the port's origin to:
  net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl using their favorite ports management tool.
  Example for portmaster:
  portmaster -o net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl nss-pam-ldapd

20120527:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/qt4-gui
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Qt started using the raster graphics system engine, which relies on
  shared memory. Be sure to check pkg-message.

20120525:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kdepim4, deskutils/kdepim4-runtime
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  kdepim4 has been updated to 4.8.3. For those who prefer old
  kdepim-4.4.11.1 deskutils/kdepim44* ports have been added.
  To stay with kdepim-4.4.11.1 run the following commands:

  # portmaster -o deskutils/kdepim44-runtime kdepim-runtime-4\*
  # portmaster -o deskutils/kdepim44 kdepim-4\*

20120525:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.8.3. Several ports were split,
  thus manual intervention into update procedure is required:

  # pkg_delete -f kde-runtime-\* ruby\*-kdebindings-korundum\* \
    kalgebra-4\* kdeaccessibility-4\* kdeutils-4\* kde-baseapps-\* \
    plasma-applet-icontasks\*
  # portmaster -a

  AFFECTS: users of dns/poweradmin
  AUTHOR: Edmondas Girkantas <eg@fbsd.lt>

  Some database changes have been made between version 2.1.4 and 2.1.5,
  upgrading needs to be done manually by running the following SQL:

  For MySQL users:

  ALTER TABLE `zones` ADD `zone_templ_id` INT( 11 ) NOT NULL;
  ALTER TABLE zones ENGINE = InnoDB;
  ALTER TABLE zone_templ ENGINE = InnoDB;
  ALTER TABLE zone_templ_records ENGINE = InnoDB;

  For PostgreSQL users:

20120516:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  PHP has been updated to 5.4. Suhosin patch has been disabled until the
  new version will be released (soon). Suhosing extension will take more
  time. LINKTHR option is now enabled by default, be sure to flag it if
  you are updating using an old saved configuration. sqlite2 extension
  has been permanently removed.
  If you want to remain at PHP 5.3, a new port (lang/php53) has been
  created for such purpose.

20120513:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/smokeping
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Smokeping has been updated to 2.6.7, and the web server configuration
  has changed. FastCGI is now preferred. Please check the documentation
  that your web server configuration is OK.

20120512:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/p5-XML-SAX
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  p5-XML-SAX (X-S) was split into p5-XML-SAX-Base (X-S-B) and p5-XML-SAX for
  version 0.99.  Since X-S-B now installs some files formerly installed by X-S
  the package for X-S must be deinstalled before updating X-S.

  # pkg_delete -fx p5-XML-SAX
  # portmaster textproc/p5-XML-SAX

  (users of pkgng can substitute pkg_delete with pkg delete)

20120511:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/xpdf
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  In order to allow graphics/xpdf and graphics/poppler-utils to coexist,
  graphics/xpdf binaries have been moved from ${LOCALBASE}/bin to
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf. The symlink ${LOCALBASE}/bin/xpdf points to
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf/xpdf. However the other utilities installed by
  the xpdf port conflict with poppler-utils, no symlinks are maintained.
  Applicaions and scripts which use the pdf* utilities provided by
  graphics/xpdf must reference them using their new location, specify
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf in $PATH, or use the same utilities provided by
  graphics/poppler-utils.

20120510:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gitolite
  AUTHOR: milki@rescomp.berkeley.edu

  gitolite has been split into two ports: devel/gitolite for 3.x and
  devel/gitolite2 for 2.x

  gitolite 3.x is NOT "API" compatible with gitolite 2.x and requires
  additional manual migration steps which can be found in the online
  documentation.

  http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/install.html#migr

  Current users wishing to continue using gitolite 2.x should run:

  # portmaster -o devel/gitolite2 gitolite
    or
  # portupgrade -o devel/gitolite2 gitolite

20120430:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-google-api-python-client
  AUTHOR: nivit@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 1.0.b8. This new version has important
  changes which might break your code:

  * apiclient.anyjson has moved to oauth2client.anyjson.
  * Some calls, for example, taskqueue().lease() used to require
    a parameter named body. In this new release only methods that
    really need to send a body require a body parameter, and so
    you may get errors about an unknown 'body' parameter in your call.
    The solution is to remove the unneeded body={} parameter

  See http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/wiki/PyDoc for
  more information.

20120426:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/libreoffice

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix, mail/postfix2[6-8]
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  The latest update to these ports adds support to turn off
  the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.1.
  These protocols are known to cause inter-operability issues
  with certain services, e.g. hotmail.  If using TLS with Postfix,
  please consult the RELEASE_NOTES for information about possible
  workarounds.

  files based on the examples provided.

20120404:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/net-snmp
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  The net-snmp startup script now specifies a new pid_file to avoid a
  conflict that existed with bsnmpd.  As a result, the startup script
  cannot find currently running versions of snmpd.

  You will need to either stop the daemon before upgrading or locate the
  PID of snmpd and manually kill it after upgrade.  Then, start the daemon
  as you normally would.

20120326:
  AFFECTS: users of www/tomcat7

20120308:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8 and lang/perl5.10
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 and lang/perl5.10 have been removed since they've
  been EOL upstream for 3yrs and 2yrs respectively.  The default
  of lang/perl5.12 has not changed (yet).  Conditional checks for
  perl < 5.12 have been removed.  UNLESS you have PERL_VERSION=5.8.x
  or PERL_VERSION=5.10.x in /etc/make.conf you need take no action.
  If you do, you will have to recompile all perl dependant ports after
  updating your ports tree.  Please see entry 20110517 for help.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  Postfix 2.9.0 contains several major changes, some of which could
  result in incompatible or unexpected behavior.  Regardless of the
  version from which you are upgrading, please carefully review the
  RELEASE_NOTES before proceeding.

20120126:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd and ftp/proftpd-mysql
  AUTHOR: Martin Matuska <mm@FreeBSD.org>

  The proftpd port has been updated to 1.3.4 and changed to use
  dynamically loadable modules. Please add corresponding LoadModule
  directives to your configuration file, like in the following example:

    LoadModule mod_tls.c

  The modules mod_sql_mysql and mod_sql_postgres are now outside of the
  main proftpd port:
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_mysql
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_postgres

  The proftpd-mysql port has been removed, use the alternative port:
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_mysql

20120121:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/vdr
  AUTHOR: Juergen Lock <nox@FreeBSD.org>

  The vdr ports have been updated to 1.7.22 which involves at least
  two changes:

  - svdrpsend.pl is now called svdrpsend.

  - The ttxtsubs channels.conf format has changed so if you use that
    plugin you need to edit /usr/local/etc/vdr/channels.conf for the
    channels you want to receive teletext subtitles on - see:

        /usr/local/share/doc/vdr-plugin-ttxtsubs/HISTORY

20120116:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  From the upstream RELEASE_NOTES:

  Instead of terminating immediately with a "fatal" message when a
  database file can't be opened, a Postfix daemon program now logs
  an "error" message, and continues execution with reduced
  functionality.

  Specify "daemon_table_open_error_is_fatal = yes" to get the
  historical behavior (immediate termination with "fatal" message).

  Logfile-based alerting systems may need to be updated to look for
  "error" messages in addition to "fatal" messages.

  By default the Postfix SMTP server no longer reports transcripts
  of sessions where a client command is rejected because a table is
  unavailable.  To receive such reports, add the new "data" class to
  the notify_classes parameter value. The reports will be sent to the
  error_notice_recipient address as before. This class is also used
  by the Postfix SMTP client to report about sessions that fail
  because a table is unavailable.

20120116:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xcb-util
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  x11/xcb-util was updated to 0.3.8 and was split in new modules.
  Dependencies were adjusted but main port symbols were moved to a single
  library, xcb-util.so.  For this reason, all dependent ports must be
  recompiled.If you use portmaster, run:

  # portmaster -R -r xcb-util-0

  Or for portupgrade:

  # portupgrade -r xcb-util-0\*

  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.14.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.14 from lang/perl5.{8,10,12} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20110517 in this file.

20111205:
  AFFECTS: users of ruby-gnome ports
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  ruby-gnome has been updated to 1.0.3. Some of them have been removed
  since they are no longer included upstream. The meta port is
  now x11/ruby-gnome2. To update run the following command:

  # portmaster -o x11/ruby-gnome2 x11/ruby-gnome2-all

  You may also wish to remove the old ports using:

  # portmaster -s

  AFFECTS: users of print/flpsed or www/dillo2
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  The new versions of flpsed and dillo have switched from
  x11-toolkits/fltk2 to the new fltk 1.3.0 from x11-toolkits/fltk.
  Users who have customizations specific to fltk2 may need to consult
  the fltk 1.3 documents in order to adjust their local settings. For
  dillo, some commonly-used key bindings have changed, and new
  configuration options are available: consult dillorc.dist and
  keysrc.dist for details.

20111019:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/thunderbird or www/seamonkey with lightning
           plugin installed.
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  To get an up to date version of lightning you should use the new
  LIGHTNING option in mail/thunderbird or www/seamonkey. This option
  is not enabled by default so you have to run "make config" prior
  to the build. The old deskutils/lightning-thunderbird and
  deskutils/lightning ports should no longer be used and will be
  removed very soon.

  Like other XPIs ports, lightning now registers itself as a global
  extension and doesn't create the XPI to be installed manually.
  Upgrading users should remove lightning from their profile before
  installing Thunderbird or SeaMonkey the first time with the new
  LIGHTNING option enabled.

20111018:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  The default smtp_address_preference value is now "any" instead
  of "ipv6", meaning choose randomly between IPv6 and IPv4. With
  this the Postfix SMTP client will have more success delivering
  mail to sites that have problematic IPv6 configurations.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-subversion-freebsd
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  devel/p5-subversion-freebsd has been removed as it is no longer necessary.
  If you have it installed please run the following to switch to
  devel/p5-subversion:

  portmaster -o devel/p5-subversion p5-subversion-freebsd

  Please also see the second entry below (20111016) if haven't upgraded
  subversion yet.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC has been updated to 4.7.2. A number of files were moved between
  packages and several ports were split, thus manual intervention into
  update procedure is required:

  # pkg_delete -f raptor-1\* kdelibs-4\* kdebase-\*4\* \
    kdeaccessibility-4\* kdeedu-4\* kdegames-4\* kdegraphics-4\* \
    kdesdk-4\* kdeutils-4\* konq-plugins-4\* ktts\* nepomukcontroller\* \
    ruby\*-kdebindings\* kdebindings-smoke\*
  # pkg_delete -f kdehier4\*
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/etc/pam.d/* \
    /usr/local/etc/pam.d/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d/* \
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/services/* \
    /usr/local/share/dbus-1/services/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/system-services/* \
    /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system-services/
  # rmdir /usr/local/kde4/etc/pam.d /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d \
    /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/*services
  # rm -r /var/tmp/kdecache-*
  # portmaster misc/kdehier4

  If you have - or plan to install - net/kdenetwork4, also run:

  # portmaster -o net/linphone-base ortp

  Finally:

  # portmaster -a

  Also, remove /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d from local_startup in rc.conf(5).
  Failure to do this will cause all enabled scripts in /usr/local/etc/rc.d
  to be started twice.

  Remember to check for missing ports, bearing in mind that x11/kdebase4*
  ports were replaced by x11/kde4-* ones, ktts was replaced by jovie, while
  konq-plugins-kde4 and nepomukcontroller were removed. Then:

  # portmaster --check-depends

  You're also encouraged to run `pkg_cutleaves` or similar to check for
  orphaned ports.

  Please, note that `pkg_add -r kde4` will not install Plasma scriptengines
  and printer utilities by default anymore, and `pkg_add -r kdegames4` will
  not install Kajongg. This was made to avoid depending by default on
  kdebindings.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion, devel/subversion-freebsd,
           devel/p5-subversion, devel/py-subversion,
           devel/ruby-subversion and java/subversion-java and
           all dependand ports.
  AUTHOR: Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>

  Subversion was updated to version 1.7.0 and port was reworked.

  Now there is no "devel/subversion-freebsd" port. All FreeBSD-specific patches
  are incorporated into main subversion port as options, which are turned ON by
  default.

  These options are:

  P4_STYLE_MARKERS -- change conflict markers to P4 style,
                      established for FreeBSD projects.
                      This is not mandatory for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  ENHANCED_KEYWORD -- Support for custom keywords, like
                      $ FreeBSD $ in sources.
                      This is MANDATORY for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  FREEBSD_TEMPLATE -- Standard FreeBSD commit template.
                      It is RECOMMENDED for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  Also, subversion 1.7.0 changes the working copy format,
  and a working copy cannot be shared between
  subversion 1.7.0 and 1.6.x. Please, think twice before
  upgrading.

  Additional the port "devel/subversion16" was created to
  support subversion 1.6.x. Subversion 1.7.x and 1.6.x
  cannot be installed simultaneously!

  Binding ports can be built with Subversion 1.7.0 (Default)
  or with Subversion 1.6.x. To build bindings with subversion 1.6.x
  you should set variable WITH_SUBVERSION_VER to "16".

  There are several ways to upgrade, depending on what you used
  before and what you want to get after upgrade.

  (a) You use devel/subversion without FreeBSD patches and, maybe,
      some bindings. You want fresh'n'new subversion 1.7.0.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion && make config
  <deselect first three options described above, if you want it>
  # portupgrade -r devel/subversion
    or
  # portmaster -R -r subversion-1.6

  (b) You use devel/subversion-freebsd and, maybe, some
      bindings. You want fresh'n'new subversion 1.7.0, again
      with FreeBSD patches.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion && make config
  <make sure that first three options are selected>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portupgrade -r devel/subversion
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portmaster -R -r subversion-1.7

  (c) You use devel/subversion without FreeBSD patches and, maybe,
      some bindings. You want good old subversion 1.6.x, again
      without again.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion16 && make config
  <deselect first three options described above, if you want it>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion
  # portupgrade -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -r devel/subversion16
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion
  # portmaster -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -R -r subversion-1.6

  (d) You use devel/subversion-freebsd and, maybe, some bindings.
      You want good old subversion 1.6.x, with FreeBSD patches.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion16 && make config
  <make sure, that first three options are selected>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portupgrade -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -r devel/subversion16
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portmaster -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -R -r subversion-1.6

20111005:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/erlang
  AUTHOR: Jimmy Olgeni <olgeni@FreeBSD.org>

  Following the R14B04 upgrade the JAVA, X11, WX and ODBC port
  options have been set to OFF by default; this will allow to replace
  lang/erlang-lite with lang/erlang for headless operation in the
  near future.

  If you need any of these options, run "make config" in lang/erlang
  before upgrading, or set your make.conf accordingly.

20111003:
  AFFECTS: users of math/qhull
  AUTHOR: Stephen Montgomery-Smith <stephen@FreeBSD.org>

  The port math/qhull has been moved to math/qhull5, and math/qhull has been
  updated to a version that is incompatible with all ports previously using
  math/qhull.  If you are upgrading a port that has math/qhull as a dependency,
  please delete the port math/qhull first, so that math/qhull5 is properly
  made as a dependency.

20110929:
  AFFECTS: users of net/py-zope.proxy, devel/py-zope.testing and
           devel/py-zope.interface
  AUTHOR: Ruslan Mahmatkhanov <cvs-src@yandex.ru>

  Several Zope ports have been renamed for consistency with their
  upstream distributions. Please run the following commands to update
  your local installations:

  If you use portmaster run:
  # portmaster -o devel/py-zope.interface devel/py-zopeInterface
  # portmaster -o net/py-zope.proxy net/py-zopeproxy
  # portmaster -o devel/py-zope.testing devel/py-zopetesting

  If you use portupgrade run:
  # portupgrade -o devel/py-zope.interface devel/py-zopeInterface
  # portupgrade -o net/py-zope.proxy net/py-zopeproxy
  # portupgrade -o devel/py-zope.testing devel/py-zopetesting

20110928:
  AFFECTS: users of 10-current
  AUTHOR: eadler@FreeBSD.org

  There are known issues installing ports on FreeBSD 10+ due to
  bogus assumptions by various build scripts. This will not be fixed
  until 9-RELEASE is released.

  There are two workarounds:

  1) Set UNAME_r=9.9-CURRENT in your environment
  2) Set REVISION="9.9" in  ${SRCDIR}/sys/conf/newvers.sh

20110928:
  AFFECTS: users of www/nginx-devel
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  Note: 1.1.4 release introduces several API changes which may affect
  third-party modules.

20110925:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python*
  AUTHOR: lwhsu@FreeBSD.org

  The HUGE_STACK_SIZE option has been removed, now Python will use default
  thread stack size of the system.  If you want to change it, specify it
  with -DTHREAD_STACK_SIZE=<size> in CFLAGS.

20110925:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap*
  AUTHOR: ume@FreeBSD.org

  The security/cyrus-sasl2 was updated to 2.1.25.  If the SASL option
  is enabled (disabled by default), net/openldap* must be recompiled
  after upgrading cyrus-sasl2.

20110921:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/maven2 and devel/maven3
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/maven2 and devel/maven3 now rely on a wrapper port:
  devel/maven-wrapper. If you plan to upgrade the devel/maven[23] ports, you
  will have to uninstall all of them before reinstalling them.

20110917:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/tvbrowser
  AUTHOR: lme@FreeBSD.org

  From version 3.0.2 on TV-Browser doesn't include any plugins any longer. You
  are supposed to download the plugins manually, this also means that you need
  to download the appropriate channel sources plugin for your country. After
  installing it your previously configured channels are visible again. To do so,
  select "Tools -> Install / Update Plugins..." and choose the plugins you need.

20110915:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/unbound
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  unbound supports GOST from version 1.4.12 but only if dns/ldns was build
  with GOST support too. There is no way to check the option when unbound
  builds, so you should make sure the option is on in both unbound and lds.

20110914:
  AFFECTS: users of www/asterisk-stat
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  asterisk-stat depends on asterisk16 now, you will need to update asterisk
  and asterisk-addons to 1.6. Instructions on upgrading your configuration
  files are here:

  http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.6.2/UPGRADE-1.6.txt

  If you use portmaster run:
  # portmaster -o net/asterisk16 net/asterisk14
  # portmaster -o net/asterisk16-addons net/asterisk14-addons

  If you use portupgrade run:
  # portupgrade -o net/asterisk16 net/asterisk14
  # portupgrade -o net/asterisk16-addons net/asterisk14-addons

20110909:
  AFFECTS: users of net/p5-SOAP-Lite
  AUTHOR: az@FreeBSD.org

  SOAP::Transport::TCP is not a part of net/p5-SOAP-Lite
  distribution since version 0.714. If you need SOAP::Transport::TCP
  you should install net/p5-SOAP-Transport-TCP manually.

20110901:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db51
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/db51 port (Oracle Berkeley DB version 5.1) has been
  removed.  Version 5.2 of the package is available in databases/db5.
  Users of ports that depend on the removed 5.1 versions are advised
  to rebuild the affected ports.

20110830:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/racket
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  Racket has been upgraded to version 5.1.3. Due to the recent rewrite of
  the Racket graphics handling code, it is no longer possible to build
  this port without X11.

  The WITHOUT_X11 switch now controls if X11 is brought in as
  USE_GNOME/LIB_DEPENDS or BUILD_DEPENDS.

  In the latter case you will be able to build a Racket package that can
  then be deployed on a headless server.

20110829:
  AFFECTS: users of security/maia
  AUTHOR: Janky Jay, III <ek@purplehat.org>

  There have been many changes to the maia port, including renaming the rc
  script and variables from maia to maiad.  You will need to replace any
  instances of maia with maiad in /etc/rc.conf, as well as renaming /var/amavisd
  to /var/maiad.  The 'vscan' user's home directory also needs to be changed to
  /var/maiad.

  These can be done by:

  # mv /var/amavisd /var/maiad
  # sed -i.bak -e "s/^maia_/maiad_/" /etc/rc.conf
  # pw usermod vscan -d /var/maiad

20110828:
  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-{base,client,image}
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  During the update to 1.4.8, the GNUTLS option was changed from ON to
  OFF by default. Because old configuration options are saved, users
  should re-run 'make config' and explicitly deselect the GNUTLS option
  before upgrading.

20110823:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby

  The default ruby version has been reverted from 1.9 to 1.8. If you followed
  the procedure in the 20110822 entry, you may need to follow these steps:

  If you use portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby18 lang/ruby19
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-1.8

  If you use portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby19
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby18 # if you have it installed
  # portupgrade -f ports-mgmt/portupgrade
  # portupgrade -x ruby-1.9.\* -fr lang/ruby19

  If you wish to keep the 1.9 version as default, add the following lines
  to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 1.9 as default version.
  #
  RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.9

  AFFECTS: users of devel/libnotify and net/libproxy
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  libnotify and libproxy are updated with shared library bumps.
  This requires dependancies to be rebuild.

  # portmaster -r libnotify-0
  # portmaster -r libproxy-0
  # portmaster -a
or
  # portupgrade -rf libnotify-0.\* libproxy-0.\*
  # portupgrade -aR

  AFFECTS: users of mail/enigmail-* ports
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  Like other XPIs ports, enigmail now registers itself as a global
  extension and doesn't create the XPI to be installed manually.
  Upgrading users should remove enigmail from their profile before
  installing the new port.

20110815:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/swapexd
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  swapexd used to clobber its config file on deinstall, unfortunately this will
  not be fixed in installed packages. Back up your config before updating, or
  you will lose it!

  # cp /usr/local/etc/swapexd/swapexd.conf ~/swapexd.conf.bak

20110808:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/zenoss
  AUTHOR: pphillips@experts-exchange.com

  Some functionality of zenoss requires a valid shell.  The FreeBSD port until
  now was installing a user account without a shell.  To fix your existing
  installation, please run the following command as root:

  # pw usermod zenoss -s /bin/sh -d /usr/local/zenoss

20110808:

  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  Along with new features and bug fixes, amavisd-new 2.7.0 introduces some
  incompatibilities with previous releases.  Several variable defaults, SQL
  schemas, and other changes warrant a careful review of the RELEASE_NOTES.
  Also note that helper programs amavis.c and amavis-milter.c are no longer
  distributed with this package; for milter functionality, please shift to
  the dedicated security/amavisd-milter port.

20110731:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/guile

    or
  # portupgrade -o textproc/hunspell hungarian/hunspell

20110711:
  AFFECTS: users of java/openjdk6
  AUTHOR: jkim@FreeBSD.org

  java/openjdk6 has been updated to b23 and "WEB" option (for web browser
  plug-in and Java Web Start) has been deprecated. If you need the same
  functionality, rebuild the port with "ICEDTEA" option first, then install
  a new port java/icedtea-web with "PLUGIN" option (default). Also, if you
  have a symlink to the previous IcedTeaPlugin.so in ~/.mozilla/plugins,
  for example, you need to remove it. Note system-wide symlinks are now
  automatically created by java/icedtea-web for your convenience.

20110711:
  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-libwww
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  portmaster cannot process the upgrade of www/p5-libwww from version
  5 to version 6. To upgrade p5-libwww, use portupgrade instead, or
  deinstall p5-libwww before reinstalling:

  If you use portmaster:
  # pkg_delete -f 'p5-libwww-5*' ; portmaster www/p5-libwww

  If you use portupgrade, no special treatment is necessary.

20110711:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/icu
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  # portupgrade -fr devel/icu

20110706:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/zoneminder
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  RC script was renamed from zm to zoneminder. So do variables at
  /etc/rc.conf[.local]. One should fix the latter file.

20110705:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libgcrypt and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The libgcrypt port has been updated to 1.5.0 and all shared libraries
  versions have been bumped. So you need to rebuild all applications that
  depend on libgcrypt. Do something like:

  # portmaster -r libgcrypt
    or
  # portupgrade -rf libgcrypt

20110703:
  AFFECTS: users of print/lyx and print/lyx-devel
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  print/lyx has been updated to 2.0. print/lyx16 has been added to ports tree

20110630:
  AFFECTS: users of math/octave-forge* and benchmarks/octave-forge-benchmark
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  The octave-forge* port structure has been completely redesigned.  This was
  to make them compatible with portmaster and other port installation tools.

  Before using the new octave-forge* ports, the old octave-forge* ports must
  be completely removed with, for example, the command:

  # pkg_delete "octave-forge*"

20110630:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/thunderbird
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

20110622:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been updated to 5.12.4.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.12.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.12 from lang/perl5.{8,10} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20100715 in this file.

  So, if pam_winbind.so started to work for you - send him kudos.

20110619:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ezbounce and irc/ezbounce-devel
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  irc/ezbounce-devel was moved to irc/ezbounce as the version previously in
  irc/ezbounce has been broken for some time and the distfile is not available
  anymore.

  If you are upgrading from a 1.0X version make sure to verify that your config
  still works. There is basic compatibility for old config files but a lot has
  changed, see http://linuxftw.com/ezbounce/files/CHANGES

  If you run irc/ezbounce-devel you need to run one of the following commands:

  # portmaster -o irc/ezbounce irc/ezbounce-devel
    or
  # portupgrade -o irc/ezbounce irc/ezbounce-devel

20110619:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.14
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.14 has been updated to 5.14.1.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.14.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.14 from lang/perl5.{8,10,12} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20110517 in this file.

20110618:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailscanner
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mailscanner no longer requires running of any renew-* targets to
  update the config files / wrapper scripts; it is now automatically
  performed as the port is installed -- these targets have been removed.

  As an added bonus, the binary package now performs these steps as well,
  in case you don't have a portstree handy.

  Before upgrading, please backup your PREFIX/etc/MailScanner,
  PREFIX/share/MailScanner and PREFIX/libexec/MailScanner if you
  have customised any of these directories, just in case.

20110608:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-milter
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  A change have been made to rc.d script for amavisd-milter makes it to
  specify -s explicitly.  If you used to override the location of listening
  socket by specifying -s, please migrate to the new way (specify
  amavisd_milter_socket in /etc/rc.conf).

20110607:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-Moose and devel/p5-Class-MOP
  AUTHOR: az@FreeBSD.org

  p5-Moose has been updated to 2.0007. Now p5-Class-MOP is a part of the
  p5-Moose distribution. Manual intervention of the update procedure is
  required:

    # portmaster -o devel/p5-Moose devel/p5-Class-MOP
    # portmaster -R -r p5-Moose-\*

  or do the same things with portupgrade.

  To check everything went fine you can run:
    # perl -Moose\ 999
  and
    # perl -MClass::MOP\ 999
  in both cases you should see output:
  version 999 required--this is only version 2.0007

20110606:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sympa
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Sympa previously used to install to ${PREFIX}/sympa, which goes against
  the general rules for hierarchy. Most files which were previously found
  in ${PREFIX}/sympa should now be found in ${PREFIX}/libexec/sympa.

  Any configuration in httpd.conf files etc will need to be updated to the
  new directory.

  Before upgrade, it is advisable to back up configuration files
  ${PREFIX}/etc/sympa.conf and wwsympa.conf since previous versions wipe these
  out on deinstall.

20110606:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The mariadb port has been split into -client, -scripts, and -server ports
  ala mysql.  You can now install only the parts that you need.

  If you have devel/libevent installed along with mariadb you should do
  something like:

	pkg_delete mariadb\*
	portmaster devel/libevent

20110605:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  gnutls has been updated to 2.12.6.1 and all shared libraries versions have

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zfsnap
  AUTHOR: Aldis Berjoza <aldis@bsdroot.lv>

  There is an issue with zpool v28 (currently only on 9-CURRENT, or
  8-STABLE systems that have been manually patched) that affects
  zfSnap. If you are using v28 make sure to use the -zpool28fix flag
  with zfsnap to work around the problem.

  For more information please see:

  /var/run/radiusd
  /var/log/radacct
  /var/log/radius.log

20110529:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/*kmfl*
  AUTHOR: nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net

  KMFL keyboard ports are now shared between IBus and SCIM KMFL IMEngines
  (textproc/ibus-kmfl and textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine). Thus, the prefix
  'scim-' is dropped from keyboard ports names.

  Similar to m17n, both engines now search engine-neutral locations,
  ${LOCALBASE}/share/kmfl/ and ~/.kmfl/. Users have to move their local
  keyboard files from ~/.scim/kmfl/ to ~/.kmfl/.

20110523:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_perl2
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  mod_perl2 was updated to version 2.0.5, this version includes
  p5-Apache-Reload again. The ports p5-Apache-Reload is now marked as
  conflict for mod_perl2.

  To update your mod_perl2 with portmaster use the commands

  # portmaster -o www/mod_perl2 www/p5-Apache-Reload
  # portmaster -R -r mod_perl2

20110522:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: vbox@FreeBSD.org

  The emulators/virtualbox-ose port has been updated to 4.0.8. If you
  want to stay with VirtualBox 3.2.x please run:

  # portmaster -o emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod-legacy emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod
  # portmaster -o emulators/virtualbox-ose-legacy emulators/virtualbox-ose
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod-legacy emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod
  # portupgrade -o emulators/virtualbox-ose-legacy emulators/virtualbox-ose

  The emulators/virtualbox-ose-legacy port will always include the
  latest legacy version as a fallback if you hit a serious regression
  in the latest version.

20110517:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.14 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.12, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.14):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.14 -f perl-5.12.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.14 lang/perl5.12

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20110516:
  AFFECTS: users of net/skype, net/skype-devel, net-im/skype, net-im/skype-devel
  AUTHOR: Ion-Mihai Tetcu <itetcu@FreeBSD.org>

  All skype ports were moved to net-im/:
  - skype12: unchanged, very old version (for FreeBSD 6)
  - skype20: last version with OSS support, that used to live in net/skype; the
  DISTFILE is gone from the vendor but if you happen to have it, it would be a
  way of having sound w/o needing to upgrade your base OS
  - [RECOMMENDED] skype: currently at 2.1.0.81 and the best supported
  - skype-devel: currently at 2.2.0.25, sounds is OK, video doesn't work

  To run either skype or skype-devel with fully working sound you need:
  - to run fc10 (most probably, please report what you can do with fc4):
  (OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f10,OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f10
  in /etc/make.conf for systems that doesn't have it as default)
  - In order for Skype to work OK, you need your kernel and modules to be:
	- post 2011-05-03 in on HEAD
	- post 2011-05-08 in on 7,8-STABLE
  The port tries to catch if your system version is too old, but there's a
  ~3months window where because of a lack of OSVERSION bump, this is not
  possible. So please check; and PLEASE READ THE PKGMESSAGE for setup details.
  For how to update your kernel/world, see:
  http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html

  IF YOUR OSVERSION IS NOT NEW ENOUGH, SOUND (ESPECIALLY MIC) WON'T WORK.

  If you run into problems, at very least we need to know the output of:
  $ uname -a; sysctl compat.linux | head -2; \
    grep OVERRIDE_LINUX_ /etc/make.conf; \
    cat /compat/linux/etc/alsa/pcm/pcm-oss.conf
  the skype version you are using and hardware details (eg. webcam, if related)
  I most probably will ignore any mail not containing this info since without
  it it's impossible to help.
  Please test your sound /video setup outside skype before blaming skype /
  mailing me.

20110516:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/musicpd
  AUTHOR: Chris Rees <utisoft@gmail.com>

  Musicpd now installs the binary for the server as bin/musicpd, rather than
  mpd, to remove a conflict with net/mpich2; before upgrade you should run:

  # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/musicpd stop

  Likewise, mpd.conf has been renamed musicpd.conf-- if you want to keep it
  as mpd.conf then place MPDCONF="mpd.conf" into /etc/make.conf, otherwise
  after upgrade run:

  # mv /usr/local/etc/mpd.conf /usr/local/etc/musicpd.conf

20110514:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/gksu, sysutils/libgksu, sysutils/libgksuui
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  Before upgrading remove sysutils/libgksuui.

20110511:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  Due to a bug when upgrading from 23.2 or later versions, everything
  installed by other ports in "${PREFIX}/share/emacs" gets removed.

  Before upgrading:

  * Please backup custom configurations in "${PREFIX}/share/emacs".
  * After upgrading reinstall any ports that may have had files in the
    "${PREFIX}/share/emacs" directory.

20110509:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

20110503:
  AFFECTS: users of www/codeigniter and www/codeigniter-devel
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  www/codeigniter has been renamed to www/codeigniter17 to track the
  legacy 1.7.* branch of Codeigniter development. www/codeigniter-devel
  has been renamed to www/codeigniter to track the recommended 2.0.*

  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  Ocaml compiler and libraries suite has been updated to 3.12.
  There appears to be an ABI incompatibility with .cmi files
  generated by previous compiler versions.  Though these should
  only affect the linking process, if some application you're
  using start to misbehave after the lang/ocaml updated you're
  advised to rebuild this applications using the new ocaml version.

  Loginname, path, scripts and config files have been renamed in 4.3.0
  Steps to update:
  1. Stop and deinstall the old version.
  2. Copy the remaining config files to the new location.
  3. Read the instructions
  4. merge your old config with the upgrade430.sh script

  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap24-client
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP has been upgraded to 2.4.25.  In this version, certain library
  routines were moved from liblutil to libldap.  If you previously built
  the library with "FETCH" support, this would cause libldap to depend on
  FreeBSD's libfetch.so library.

  As of 20110402, a local change have been introduced so OpenLDAP libraries
  link against libfetch.so when FETCH is enabled.  Normally, no further user
  interaction would be required.

  For new installations, the FETCH option have been turned off by default.

20110324:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.6.1. As usual a number of files were

  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  The www/firefox port has been updated to 4.0. If you want to stay with
  Firefox 3.6 please run:

  # portupgrade -o www/firefox36 www/firefox
  # portupgrade -o www/firefox36-i18n www/firefox-i18n (if installed)
    or
  # portmaster -o www/firefox36 www/firefox
  # portmaster -o www/firefox36-i18n www/firefox-i18n (if installed)

  Do not select the OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS option on a system with less then
  2 GB of RAM otherwise you will run out of memory during the build.

  Please make sure all your addons are compatible with Firefox 4.0 and
  backup your ~/.mozilla directory prior to the first launch of Firefox
  4.0.

  The startup script has been renamed from firefox3 to firefox.

20110319:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-client
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The shared library version of the client library was increased to reflect
  ABI changes, and avoid compatibility problems with the client library
  in MySQL 5.1, so client programs that use the 5.5 client library should
  be recompiled against the 5.5.10 client library.
  This can be achieved with:

  # portmaster -r mysql-client-5.5
    or
  # portupgrade -fr mysql-client-5.5

20110318:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node and www/node-devel
  AUTHOR: araujo@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/node was merged with www/node-devel since there is no longer a
  development version. Also www/node has not followed the stable upstream
  prior to this update.

  To keep www/node updated in your applications, from now on you must use
  www/node instead of www/node-devel. If you have been using the www/node-devel,
  you must run one of the following commands to upgrade:

  # portmaster -o www/node www/node-devel
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node www/node-devel

20110317:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uzbl
  AUTHOR: Klaus Aehlig <aehlig@linta.de>

  The port has been updated to version as of 2011/02/15. This introduces
  the following incompatabilities.

  - $UZBL_FIFO, $UZBL_TITLE are available to scripts as environment variables,
  but not as command-line arguments.
  - environment variables are no longer expanded by the config parser
  - download handling has changed
  - cookie daemons are no longer supported

  Users are advised to change their personal configuration files/scripts accordingly.

20110316:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/duplicity
  AUTHOR: peter.schuller@infidyne.com

  sysutils/duplicity has been upgraded to 0.6.11. The old version
  (0.5.20) is retained as sysutils/duplicity05. Duplicity 0.6 should
  be generally compatible, but pay special attention to the new meaning
  of the --archive-dir command. In particular, the archive dir is now
  mandatory and defaults to ~/.cache/duplicity. You may have to
  --exclude accordingly.  In addition, it is recommended you consult
  the CHANGELOG, specifically the "New in v0.6.00 (2009/06/08)" section
  which details the checkpoint/restore feature (enabled by default) and
  its implications.

20110313:
  AFFECTS: users of astro/boinc-setiathome-enhanced
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  The setiathome client has been updated to version 6.12.  Before you
  update, finish and report your current workunits to avoid losing them.

20110304:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python* and py-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Python has been changed from 2.6.x to 2.7.x.
  If you have 2.6.x installed, perform an upgrade of lang/python26 to
  lang/python27 with one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python27 lang/python26

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python27 lang/python26

  If you want to retain 2.6.x as default Python version, set the
  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION variable to 'python2.6' (without quotes) in
  /etc/make.conf, then go to lang/python and perform the following
  command:

  # portupgrade -R python

  Once the installed Python has been updated to 2.7, by using the
  method above, it is required to run the upgrade-site-packages target in
  lang/python to assure that site-packages are made available to the new
  Python version.

  If using portupgrade:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  If using portmaster:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages -DUSE_PORTMASTER

  The portmaster case can take quite some time to complete due to the lack of
  cached information that the portupgrade suite uses (specifically pkg_which).
  This is not the fault of portmaster.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/jasperserver
  AUTHOR: jhelfman@experts-exchange.com

  (taken from release notes of 4.0 from vendor)
  If you are upgrading from an older JasperServer version such as 3.5 then
  you must first upgrade to JasperServer 3.7 before upgrading to 4.0.
  Upgrading directly from JasperServer 3.5 to 4.0 is not a "certified"
  (i.e. fully QA tested) procedure.

  The steps to carry out this operation are fully documented in the
  JasperReports Server Installation Guide for the 3.7 release.  You will
  need to download the JasperServer 3.7 release package to get the relevant
  files and documentation. To download the JasperServer 3.7 WAR file
  distribution zip package, go to the JasperForge.org website and to the
  JasperServer project.

  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.40, which uses a different wire
  protocol than 2.32 did.  In order to support synchronization with
  other computers where Unison is still at version 2.32, a new port
  net/unison232 has been created.  It provides unison232 and if that is
  GTK2-enabled, also unison232-text.  This unison232 port can be
  installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been updated to 5.12.3.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.12.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.12 from lang/perl5.{8,10} please

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  Postfix 2.8 introduces minor incompatibilities with previous versions.
  Alias expansion, dns lookups, TLS support, milters and other features
  are affected.  To avoid surprises, carefully review the RELEASE_NOTES.

  If you upgrade from Postfix 2.6 or earlier, you must execute "postfix
  stop" and "postfix start" before you can use the postscreen(8) daemon.
  This is needed because the Postfix 2.6 "pass" master service type did
  not work reliably on some systems. If you upgrade from Postfix 2.7, or
  from Postfix 2.8 before July 25, 2010, you must "postfix reload" (or
  "postfix stop" followed by "postfix start"). This is needed because
  the queue manager to delivery agent protocol has changed.

  Also note that the optional SPF and VDA patches have not been updated
  for Postfix 2.8; as a result, they are currently disabled.

  AFFECTS: users of www/redmine
  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  If you use 3rd party plugins that are incompatible with i18n >= 0.5.0
  (eg. variables in yml files as {{variable}}) then you need to
  install an older i18n version manually.

  # gem install -v=0.4.2 i18n

  Then upgrade the database as usual:

  # rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim
  AUTHOR: rea@FreeBSD.org

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] The default value for system_filter_user
  is now the Exim run-time user, instead of root.

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY is no longer
  optional and is forced on.  This is mitigated by the new build
  option TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST which defines a list of configuration
  files which are trusted; one per line. If a config file is owned
  by root and matches a pathname in the list, then it may be invoked
  by the Exim build-time user without Exim relinquishing root
  privileges.

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] The Exim user is no longer automatically
  trusted to supply -D<Macro[=Value]> overrides on the command-line.
  Going forward, we recommend using TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST with shim
  configs that include the main config.  As a transition mechanism,
  we are temporarily providing a work-around: the new build option
  WHITELIST_D_MACROS provides a colon-separated list of macro names
  which may be overriden by the Exim run-time user.  The values of
  these macros are constrained to the regex ^[A-Za-z0-9_/.-]*$
  (which explicitly does allow for empty values).

  Upgrading users are encouraged to fully study
    ftp://exim.inode.at/exim/ChangeLogs/NewStuff-4.73
  and
    ftp://exim.inode.at/exim/ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-4.73

  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  libksba has been updated to 1.1.0, and the shared library version has
  increased from .17 to .18.

  Directly- and indirectly-dependent ports have had their PORTREVISION
  bumped to facilitate rebuilding.  Please rebuild the dependent ports
  with your preferred upgrading tool:

	# portupgrade -rf security/libksba
  -or-
	# portmaster -w -r security/libksba

  If there are still ports on your system that require ksba.so.17 (either
  in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg, or non-existent), _please_ file a PR so
  that a correct direct dependency can be added.

  Once you are satisfied that no ports still depend on the old shared
  library version (libksba.so.17), you can safely delete it from the
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg directory if it is present there.

  AFFECTS: autotools
  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  The next stage in the ongoing cleanup of autotools-using ports is
  a refactoring of bsd.autotools.mk so that version numbers are no longer
  needed within the USE_AUTOTOOLS stanza.  There is either
  autoconf213/autoconf or automake14/automake (for the legacy versions,
  and the currently available versions).  This will considerably reduce
  the amount of tree-wide patching in future on an update.

  IMPORTANT: if you have either devel/autoconf-wrapper or
  devel/automake-wrapper installed on your system (and you most likely do)
  PLEASE update these ports to their new versions before updating anything

  after that you can run one of the following

  # portmaster asterisk

  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  As of Postfix 2.7.2, 2.6.8, 2.5.11:

  Postfix no longer automatically appends the system default CA
  (certificate authority) certificates, when it reads the CA
  certificates specified with {smtp, lmtp, smtpd}_tls_CAfile or
  with {smtp, lmtp, smtpd}_tls_CApath.  This prevents third-party
  certificates from getting mail relay permission with the
  permit_tls_all_clientcerts feature.  Unfortunately, this change
  may cause compatibility problems with configurations that rely
  on certificate verification for other purposes.  To get the old
  behavior, specify "tls_append_default_CA = yes".

  AUTHOR: Ashish SHUKLA <ashish@FreeBSD.org>

  Due to a bug when upgrading from 24.0.50.101606, everything
  installed by other ports in "${PREFIX}/share/emacs" gets removed.

  Before upgrading:

  * Please backup custom configurations in "${PREFIX}/share/emacs".
  * After upgrading reinstall any ports that may have had files in the
    "${PREFIX}/share/emacs" directory.

  Apologies for this inconvenience.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-server
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  If you are upgrading from a previous MySQL release, the server will exit
  during startup after finding that the proxies_priv table is missing.
  To create the table, start the server with the --skip-grant-tables
  option to cause it to skip the normal grant table checks, then run
  mysql_upgrade. Then stop the server and restart it normally.
  You can do this by temporarly setting the following line in rc.conf:

  mysql_args="--skip-grant-tables --skip-networking"

20101108:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/py-bsddb3
  AUTHOR: wen@FreeBSD.org

  py-bsddb3 update to 5.1.0. This release drops support for Berkeley
  DB 4.1, and adds support for Berkeley DB version 5.1, brand new. If
  you need Berkeley DB 4.1 support, keep using pybsddb 5.0.0. If you
  want support for Berkeley DB 5.1, remember to install the BDB library
  before installing these bindings.

  AFFECTS: users of www/xshttpd-devel
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  The default XS-httpd configuration file locations have changed:
  The main configuration file is now $PREFIX/etc/xshttpd/httpd.conf
  and other configuration file are stored in that same directory.
  Existing configurations should be moved over manually.
  Log files now appear in /var/log/xshttpd/ by default.

20101029:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster
  AUTHOR: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org>

  The changes to bsd.port.mk in 1.652 require all portmaster users to
  upgrade to version 3.1 or later.  The best method to do this will be
  to use the port, rather than portmaster itself:

  # pkg_delete -f portmaster\*
  # cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster && make clean && make install clean

20101026:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba35
  AUTHOR: Timur Bakeyev <timur@FreeBSD.org>

  This is the latest stable release of the Samba3 distribution. It has
  been extended with the experimental support of the NFS4-like ACLs on
  ZFS partitions, thanks to the sysutils/libsunacl library by Edward
  Tomasz Napierala(trasz). This support haven't been tested thoroughly,
  so try it on your own risk.

  This port reverted back to the pre- net/samba34 layout of the
  directories and now they are again $PREFIX/etc/samba, /var/run/samba,
  /var/log/samba, /var/db/samba and /var/spool/samba respectively.

  In case, you are upgrading from net/samba34, please rename
  corresponding samba34/ subdirectories into samba/ ones. Upgrades from
  older versions of Samba and fresh installations should be seamless.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/llvm-devel who use clang
  AUTHOR: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

  The clang portion of devel/llvm-devel has been split out and now
  resides in lang/clang-devel.  If you have devel/llvm-devel installed
  in order to use clang, you will need to install the clang-devel port
  when upgrading.

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/kismet
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  This update includes major changes in how Kismet works and is configured.
  Clients, servers, drones, and configuration files must be updated to work

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zfsnap
  AUTHOR: Aldis Berjoza <aldis@bsdroot.lv>

  Since timestamp format changed you need to use -o option with -d
  option in order to be able to delete old snapshots. Note however that
  you don't need -o when creating new snapshots, unless you want to keep
  using the old timestamp format.

  See http://wiki.bsdroot.lv/zfsnap for more info.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  Incompatibility with snapshot 20100912
  ======================================
  - If your DNSBL queries have a "secret" in the domain name, you must
    now censor this information from the postscreen(8) SMTP replies.
  - The postscreen "continue" action is now called "ignore". The old
    name is still supported but no longer documented.
  - The postscreen_hangup_action parameter was removed. Postscreen
    now always behaves as if "postscreen_hangup_action = drop".
  - The postscreen_cache_retention_time default was increased from
    1d to 7d, to avoid deleting results from expensive deep SMTP
    protocol tests too quickly.

  Incompatibility with snapshot 20100827
  ======================================
  - The Postfix SMTP client no longer appends the local domain when
    looking up a DNS name without ".".
    Specify "smtp_dns_resolver_options  = res_defnames" to get the old
    behavior, which may produce unexpected results.

20100924:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  nvidia-driver does not install vdpau library and headers anymore, they
  are now provided by multimedia/libvdpau port. To avoid conflict, please
  rebuild nvidia-driver port before upgrading your ports and before
  installing multimedia/libvdpau.

  AFFECTS: users of p5-Compress-Zlib, p5-IO-Compress-*
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The p5-Compress-Zlib, p5-IO-Compress-Base, p5-IO-Compress-Zlib and
  p5-IO-Compress-Bzip2 ports have been replaced by p5-IO-Compress.
  Users of Perl 5.10 and higher do not need to install this module
  because it is already included in the standard perl distribution.

20100920:
  AFFECTS: users of security/stunnel
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  In stunnel-4.34, the DH support is no longer configurable by the user,
  but always enabled when OpenSSL supports it instead.  This means that
  it will now most probably be enabled on the supported versions of FreeBSD.
  If this leads to problems with old SSL clients, I will look into making
  it configurable at build time again.

20100917:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk
  AUTHOR: marius@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/cdrtools-cjk port has been removed, as the required functionality is
  now available in cdrtools 3.0.0 in the standard sysutils/cdrtools port.

 20100915:
  AFFECTS: autoconf, automake
  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  autoconf has been updated from 2.62 to 2.67 -- all ports depending on
  autoconf-2.62 have had their PORTREVISIONs update, so a standard
  port updating method will suffice.

  USE_GETTEXT has been extended to also accept 'build' and 'run' for
  ports which need devel/gettext as a BUILD- or RUN-time dependency only.
  No port should now be directly depending on devel/gettext in Makefiles.

20100915:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk
  AUTHOR: marius@FreeBSD.org

  Version 3.00 of sysutils/cdrtools breaks but at the same time also
  obsoletes sysutils/cdrtools-cjk as mkisofs now employs iconv for
  character conversion. Consequently sysutils/cdrtools-cjk is marked
  BROKEN and the use of USE_CDRTOOLS=cjk as well as USE_CDRTOOLS together
  with the WITH_CJK knob left in a broken state until bsd.port.mk is
  updated by portmgr@ accordingly. Once USE_CDRTOOLS is updated to no
  longer refer to sysutils/cdrtools-cjk the latter will be removed.
  Previous users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk should switch to using
  sysutils/cdrtools instead, which might require not using the WITH_CJK
  knob until said update of bsd.port.mk has happened.

20100915:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been updated to 5.12.2.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.12.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.12 from lang/perl5.{8,10} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20100715 in this file.

20100912:
  AFFECTS: ftp/curl
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  With version 7.21.1, the cURL port is built with stricter compiler
  checking by default (the -Werror flag is passed to the C compiler,
  making it treat any warnings as fatal errors).  If you experience
  problems building cURL, re-run "make config" in the ftp/curl
  directory and disable the WERROR knob.

20100912:
  AFFECTS: www/tdiary-devel, japanese/tdiary-devel
  AUTHOR: tota@FreeBSD.org

  The stable tDiary ports, www/tdiary and japanese/tdiary, have been
  updated to 3.0.0. The development versions of tDiary have been merged

20100818:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The default lighttpd configuration file locations have changed.
  The main configuration file is now: $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
  and includes other configuration files from $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/

  For compatibility with old-style configurations, if the lighttpd_conf
  variable is not set in /etc/rc.conf, $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd.conf takes
  precedence over $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

20100815:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis and databases/redis-devel
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The redis configuration file, redis.conf, have been changed, some options
  removed in newer versions (>=2.0).  In some cases, redis-server with

  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2, which is not maintained upstream, has been
  replaced with new port, multimedia/mp4v2. The shared library version
  has been changed with this update, thus all ports that depends on
  mp4v2 library must be rebuilt:

  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Makes neon29 our default neon library in the ports tree. The www/neon28
  has been removed and www/neon29's shared library version has been changed.
  You will have to rebuild all ports that depend on www/neon29. Do this:

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o www/neon29 www/neon28
	portmaster -r neon29-

  Portupgrade users:
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o www/neon29 -f neon28-\*
	pkgdb -Ff
	portupgrade -rf neon29-\*

20100728:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/nltk
  AUTHOR: clsung@FreeBSD.org

  Nltk has been upgraded to 2.0b8 which depends on devel/py-yaml now.
  You need to deinstall nltk before upgrading, since the previous port
  will delete files installed from py-yaml during its deinstall phase.

  Use, for example:

    # pkg_delete nltk-2.0b7,1
    # portsnap fetch update
    # cd /usr/ports/textproc/nltk/
    # make install clean

20100727:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libgcrypt

  libgcrypt has been upgraded to 1.4.6 which has a shared library version
  bump.  You need to reinstall all ports that depend on it.  Use something
  like this:

	portupgrade -rf libgcrypt
	portmaster -r libgcrypt

20100722:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: Phillip <pneumann@gmail.com>

  The database schema and the format in which persistent messages are
  stored have both changed since the last release (1.7.2). When
  starting, the RabbitMQ server will detect the existence of an old
  database and will move it to a backup location, before creating a
  fresh, empty database, and will log a warning.

20100715:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.10, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.12):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.12 -f perl-5.10.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.12 lang/perl5.10

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches  more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20100626:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/ibus-mozc
  AUTHOR: daichi@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/ibus-mozc port has been updated to version 0.11.383.102,
  and separated into 5 ports to cope with upcoming new port
  japanese/scim-mozc.

    o japanese/mozc-server
    o japanese/mozc-tool
    o japanese/mozc-additions
    o japanese/ibus-mozc
    o devel/py-gyp-devel

  You cannot upgrade with portupgrade or portmaster. To upgrade, you
  must deinstall japanese/ibus-mozc first and then install the new
  japanese/ibus-mozc.

  For example:

    # pkg_delete ja-ibus-mozc-0.11.365.102_1
    # portsnap fetch update
    # cd /usr/ports/japanese/ibus-mozc/
    # make install clean

  AFFECTS: users of security/{dirmngr|gnupg}
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The security/libassuan port has been updated to version 2.0.0, and
  the applications listed above have been updated to use it as of versions
  1.1.0 and 2.0.15 respectively.  If you HAVE NOT updated your libassuan
  port as described in the 20100613 entry, you can simply update all 3
  ports together (libassuan, dirmngr if installed, and gnupg) using your
  normal upgrade path.  If you HAVE updated to libassuan-1, then you need
  to do the following before upgrading dirmngr and gnupg.

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o security/libassuan security/libassuan-1

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o security/libassuan libassuan-1

  If you use neither:

	pkg_delete -f libassuan*

  Please note, libassuan version 2.0.0 is now a shared library, so unlike
  the previous version it is now a runtime dependency and cannot be deleted
  after you are done building dirmngr and/or gnupg.

20100613:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kdepim4, and  security/{gpa|opensc}
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The security/libassuan port has been updated to version 2.0.0, however,
  the applications listed above are not yet compatible with it.  Therefore
  security/libassuan-1 has been created until they can be updated, and the
  ports listed above have been updated to depend on it.  You must first
  replace your existing libassuan with version 1 in the new location, then
  you can update the ports listed above normally.

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o security/libassuan-1 security/libassuan

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o security/libassuan-1 libassuan

  If you use neither:

	pkg_delete -f libassuan*

  AFFECTS: users of audio/libogg and audio/libao
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  There are new versions of libogg (1.2.0) and libao (1.0.0) and the
  shared library versions have been bumped (ogg.6 to ogg.7, ao.3 to ao.4).

  All ports that have an identifiable direct dependency on these libraries
  have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.  However, some ports that pull in
  the libraries indirectly may continue to look for the old versions.  To
  ensure that all are updated, perform this step:

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -rf libogg libao

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -r libogg libao

20100605:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/gstreamer-plugins-good and
	   multimedia/gstreamer-plugins-bad

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster gstreamer-plugins-bad

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -R multimedia/gstreamer-plugins-bad

20100602:

  If you are doing some Silverlight development, install multimedia/moonlight
  after updating lang/mono.

20100530:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  Another version of gettext (0.18), and another shared library version
  bump (from intl.8 to intl.9), so:

  All ports that have an identifiable known direct dependency on gettext
  have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.  If after upgrading:

	# portupgrade -rf gettext
	# portmaster -w -r gettext

  The upgrade of devel/gobject-introspection may fail because it is looking
  for libintl.so.8.  In this case, do the following:

	# cd /usr/ports/devel/gobject-introspection
	# make clean
	# make deinstall
	# make install clean

  Then continue your upgrade procedure normally.

  If there are still ports on your system that are looking for libintl.so.8
  (either in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg, or non-existent), _please_ file
  a PR so that a correct direct dependency can be added.

  Once you are satisfied that no ports still depend on the old versions (such
  as libgettextpo.so.4 and libintl.so.8) you can safely delete them from the
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg directory if they are present there.

  The following ports have been renamed to improve consistency among Haskell
  Cabal ports:

    - devel/darcs           -> devel/hs-darcs
    - ports-mgmt/porte      -> ports-mgmt/hs-porte
    - textproc/pandoc       -> textproc/hs-pandoc

    - x11-wm/xmonad-contrib -> x11-wm/hs-xmonad-contrib

  Please follow these steps below to update Haskell ports that you have
  installed:

  1) Reinstall the renamed Haskell port dependencies (see previous entry).
     Note that this will possibly require that you remove the affected leaf
     (aforementioned) ports as well;

  2) Reinstall the renamed application(s) you use.

	portupgrade -f -o devel/apr1 devel/apr

  Finally, reinstall Apache port if you deleted it earlier and update ports as
  usual (`XX' below is either 20 or 22):

	portinstall www/apacheXX

20100512:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache20
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  The rc.d script has been renamed:

	apache2.sh -> apache2

  You'll need to update any crons wrappers, etc. for the new paths.

20100511:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated from 4.3.5 to 4.4.3. A number of libraries
  was moved between packages. The recommended update procedure is to delete
  kdelibs-experimental*, kdebase-4*, kdebase-workspace-4*,
  kdebase-runtime-4*, kdepim-4*, kdepim-runtime-4*, and then update ports as
  usual and install desired KDE 4 ports:

    # pkg_delete -f kdebase-\*4\* kdepim-\*4\* kdelibs-experimental-\*4\*
    # portmaster -a (or portupgrade -aR)

  In order to enabled Nepomuk semantic desktop search you have to install
  databases/virtuoso (you don't need to manually configure or run virtuoso
  server).

20100511:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/redland RDF engine
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Redland RDF engine has been split into redland itself and rasqal engine.
  The recommended update procedure is to delete redland, then update ports
  as usual and install desired RDF ports:

    # pkg_delete -f redland-\*
    # portmaster raptor (or portupgrade -r raptor)

20100511:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/qt4-phonon, multimedia/qt4-phonon-gst,
	   multimedia/phonon, and multimedia/phonon-gstreamer
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  WITH_QT_PHONON global knob has been introduced to allow selection between
  multimedia/qt4-phonon* ports (a bit outdated Phonon, which is shipped with
  Qt 4) and multimedia/phonon* ports.  Since KDE SC 4.4 now requires fresh
  Phonon, multimedia/phonon* ports are installed by default.

  If you don't use KDE, you may set WITH_QT_PHONON=yes in /etc/make.conf
  and continue to use Qt 4 Phonon implementation ports.

  If you want to use KDE SC 4.4 (or if you want the latest Phonon), do not
  define WITH_QT_PHONON, delete multimedia/qt4-phonon* ports, and install
  multimedia/phonon*:

  If you use portmaster:

    portmaster -o multimedia/phonon multimedia/qt4-phonon
    portmaster -o multimedia/phonon-gstreamer multimedia/qt4-phonon-gst

  If you use portupgrade:

    portupgrade -f -o multimedia/phonon multimedia/qt4-phonon
    portupgrade -f -o multimedia/phonon-gstreamer multimedia/qt4-phonon-gst

  libgnome-keyring was split out of the gnome-keyring package.  Perform the
  following before doing your normal upgrade steps:

	pkg_delete -f "gnome-keyring-*"
	portmaster security/gnome-keyring
  or
	pkgdb -Ff
	portupgrade -R -x gnome-keyring -x libgnome-keyring gnome-keyring

	portinstall security/gnome-keyring

20100506:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/nullmailer on FreeBSD 6.X
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The nullmailer port was recently updated with an rc.d script to correctly
  daemonize nullmailer-send with daemon(8).  On FreeBSD 6.X, daemon(8) does
  not support "[-u user]" command-line switch, causing the nullmailer rc.d
  script failure to start nullmailer-send.

  Support for "[-u user]" command-line switch was recently MFC'd to 6-STABLE
 (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=bin/146266).  FreeBSD 6.X users
  should patch and install daemon(8) by one of the methods described below.

  If /usr/src is not yet populated, csup the 6-STABLE sources and run these
  commands:

    cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/daemon
    make install
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nullmailer start

  If /usr/src is already populated with sources from a previous 6.X release,
  use these commands:

    cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/daemon
    fetch 'http://people.freebsd.org/~glarkin/pr-links/daemon/patch-daemon.c'
    fetch 'http://people.freebsd.org/~glarkin/pr-links/daemon/patch-daemon.8'
    patch -p0 daemon.c < patch-daemon.c
    patch -p0 daemon.8 < patch-daemon.8
    make install
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nullmailer start

20100502:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with squid* the directory containing the default cache and log
  directory was changed from $PREFIX/squid/ to /var/squid/.

  The default values for the following Squid configuration parameters have
  changed as shown below:

  cache_log from $PREFIX/squid/logs/cache.log to /var/squid/logs/cache.log
  cache_store_log from $PREFIX/squid/logs/store.log to /var/squid/logs/store.log
  pid_filename from $PREFIX/squid/logs/squid.pid to /var/squid/logs/squid.pid
  coredump_dir from $PREFIX/squid/cache to /var/squid/cache

  Please check whether you need to define any of these variables in your
  squid.conf to the old defaults explicitly before updating, especially if
  you have set up automated log processing or automated log rotation.  If you
  define pid_filename in your squid.conf, you should also set squid_pidfile
  to the same value in /etc/rc.conf, cf. $PREFIX/etc/rc.d/squid.

20100419:
  AFFECTS: users of math/libgmp4
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default gmp version in FreeBSD is now 5.0.x.  The port directory
  changed from math/libgmp4 to math/gmp.  An entry has been added to MOVED
  and all depending ports revisions have been bumped, so the update should
  be handled correctly by usual port management tools such as portupgrade.

  Portmaster users, please do the following before upgrading ports that
  depend on gmp:

	portmaster -o math/gmp math/libgmp4

20100409:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  As of PHP 5.3, a few extensions were removed from or included into the core
  PHP5 package.  Follow the steps below to update your installation.

  1) Delete the following packages (if installed):

     - php5-dbase
     - php5-ncurses
     - php5-pcre

     - php5-mhash

  2) Rebuild lang/php5 and all ports that depend on it.

20100403:
  AFFECTS: users of net/dgd
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The kernel library has been separated from the main net/dgd port into its
  own net/dgd-kernel port so that all libraries are on an equal footing.
  This also reflects the split of the kernel library out from the main DGD
  distribution.

  If you wish to continue to use the kernel library you'll need to install
  net/dgd-kernel after updating to dgd-1.4.1_2.

20100330:
  AFFECTS: users of gstreamer-plugins-bad and gstreamer-plugins-good
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bacula-server, sysutils/bacula-client
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  Bacula 5.x uses new shared objects which conflict with the shared objects
  from previous versions.  You should delete all existing Bacula packages
  from your system before compiling Bacula 5.x, otherwise you'll encounter
  compilation errors.

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/bacula-dir stop
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/bacula-sd stop

  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox
  AUTHORS: beat@FreeBSD.org, mandree@FreeBSD.org (Java plugin)

  The www/firefox port has been updated to 3.6.  From now on www/firefox
  will contain the most recent version of Firefox.  Older but still
  supported releases will be available in www/firefox3 and www/firefox35.

  In order to update to Firefox 3.6 please delete your older installed
  version of Firefox first and install www/firefox afterwards.  Please
  make sure all your addons are compatible with Firefox 3.6 and backup
  your ~/.mozilla directory prior to the first launch of Firefox 3.6.

  Note that in order to use Java with Firefox 3.6, you need to install
  java/openjdk6, build it with the "WEB" option enabled and use the Iced
  Tea plugin.  To achieve the latter, each user needs to create a
  symlink to the Icedtea plugin as described in the Browsers/Firefox and
  Java[tm] Plugin section in the handbook:

	ln -s /usr/local/openjdk6/jre/lib/IcedTeaPlugin.so \
	$HOME/.mozilla/plugins

  AFFECTS: users of Mesa3D libraries and x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  If you want to use Mesa3D 7.6.1 and libdrm 2.4.17 rather than 7.4.4
  and 2.4.12, you must define WITHOUT_NOUVEAU global macro, at least,
  enabled on graphics/libGL*, graphics/libglut, graphics/dri,
  graphics/mesa-demos, and graphics/libdrm.  And please give up using
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau.

  At this time, I cannot enable latest Mesa3D and libdrm, because they
  break xf86-video-nouveau.  But old (current?) Mesa3D and libdrm do not
  break any drivers.

  AMD Radeon HD 2xxx/3xxx/4xxx users: If you use AMD Radeon HD [234]xxx
  series, please define WITHOUT_NOUVEAU global macro.  You can then use
  OpenGL Hardware Accelerator feature on these series.

20100206:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4-devel
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Default configuration file was moved to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/smb4.conf to
  avoid conflicts with the installed net/samba3?.  Also, userland utils
  are not installed by default, which should also help with the parallel
  setup of Samba3 and Samba4.

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 3 and KDE 3
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  When building qt33 and kdelibs3 (at least), while they are installed,
  because of -L/usr/local/lib being passed too soon, the currently installed
  libraries are used instead of the ones from the build.  This makes the
  build fail if you updated any of the libraries these Qt/KDE libraries are
  linked against (e.g. libjpeg).

  For the moment the workaround, when you get to this, is to move the old lib
  out of the way, e.g.:

    mv /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so.old && \
    cd /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/qt33/ && make && \
    mv /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so.old /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so && \
    portmaster -C x11-toolkits/qt33 (or portupgrade -w qt-33\*) ...

  Default version of Perl was bumped to 5.10.

  If you already have lang/perl5.8 installed, and want to switch to
  lang/perl5.10 please follow instructions in the entry 20090328 in this
  file.

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba34
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  This port was developed with the generous help of Florent Brodin.

  The default passdb backend has been changed to `tdbsam'! That breaks
  existing setups using the `smbpasswd' backend without explicit
  declaration! Please use `passdb backend = smbpasswd' if you would like
  to stick to the `smbpasswd' backend or convert your smbpasswd entries
  using e.g. `pdbedit -i smbpasswd -e tdbsam'.

  The `tdbsam' backend is much more flexible concerning per user
  settings like `profile path' or `home directory' and there are some
  commands which do not work with the `smbpasswd' backend at all.

20100130:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/sdl_mixer and graphics/sdl_image
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The SDL_mixer and SDL_image libraries have new shared library versions.
  Please rebuild all ports that depend on them.

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -r sdl_mixer-
	portmaster -r sdl_image-

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -fr audio/sdl_mixer
	portupgrade -fr graphics/sdl_image

20100125:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/openal and graphics/openal-soft
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The default OpenAL implementation was switched to audio/openal-soft.
  To update all ports correctly, the following steps have to be performed.

	pkg_delete -f openal-\*

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o audio/openal-soft audio/openal
	portmaster -r audio/openal-soft

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -ro audio/openal audio/openal-soft

  If you want to stick with audio/openal, please specify the following ports
  make flag within /etc/make.conf (or an appropriate configuration file for
  your ports):

	WANT_OPENAL=si

20100122:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/policykit and sysutils/polkit
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Due to a recent change in sysutils/policykit, both sysutils/policykit,
  and sysutils/polkit need to be rebuilt, but in a certain order.  First,
  upgrade sysutils/policykit to 0.9_6.  Then, force rebuild and reinstall
  of sysutils/polkit.  If you do not do this, applications which depend
  on polkitd will fail.

20100113:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  Port has been renamed to emulators/virtualbox-ose to reflect that we are
  using the OSE version.  A separate port for the kernel modules has been
  created: emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod.

  Please see http://wiki.freebsd.org/VirtualBox for update instructions.

20100107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  security/openvpn has been moved to security/openvpn20 and upgraded to 2.0.9.
  security/openvpn has been upgraded to 2.1.1, and security/openvpn-devel has
  been removed.

  Regular upgrades of the security/openvpn port should succeed without
  manual intervention, but if you want to stick to openvpn 2.0 or if you
  had been using openvpn-devel, manual intervention is needed, as
  follows:

  If you'd been using the security/openvpn-devel port, please use one of
  these commands for upgrading:

    portmaster -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn security/openvpn-devel

    portupgrade -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn security/openvpn-devel

  If you want to stick to openvpn 2.0, please use one of these two
  upgrade commands:

    portmaster -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn20 security/openvpn

    portupgrade -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn20 security/openvpn

20100106:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/websvn
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default install directory for websvn has changed from
  ${PREFIX}/www/data/websvn to ${PREFIX}/www/websvn.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your settings
  and data, please do the following:

	mv /usr/local/www/data/websvn /usr/local/www

  Then update as usual.

20091227:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/grok
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  The sysutils/grok port has been completely re-written. Configuration files

  be made to work with the new version.

20091226:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/ndoutils
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading you'll need to run ./upgradedb; see UPGRADING file.

20091214:
  AFFECTS: users of net/grdc
  AUTHOR: avl@FreeBSD.org

  Grdc has been renamed to Remmina upstream, and the port was also renamed
  to reflect this.  After installing remmina port you will need to download
  the ``grdc2remmina.sh'' script and run it as your normal user(s) that
  have ~/.grdc.  The script will only create ~/.remmina directory and move
  grdc config files to the new path; it does not affect anything else.

	$ fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~avl/script/grdc2remmina.sh
	$ sh grdc2remmina.sh

20091213:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/zabbix, net-mgmt/zabbix-agent
  AUTHOR: Jim Riggs <ports@christianserving.org>

  In order to simplify configuration and better separate the different
  components of Zabbix, the former zabbix port has been split into three:
  zabbix-server, zabbix-proxy, and zabbix-frontend.  Each component has
  distinct functionality and may be installed independently on separate
  systems.  The existing zabbix-agent port remains.

  Additionally, the new zabbix-frontend port now (correctly) installs the
  PHP frontend in PREFIX/www/zabbix.  The old zabbix port installed the
  files in PREFIX/share/zabbix/php.  Web server configurations must be
  updated accordingly.

  Finally, Zabbix has been updated to version 1.8.  Not everyone may be
  able to upgrade from version 1.6 immediately, though, so 1.6.8 versions
  of the ports are also available as zabbix16-server, zabbix16-proxy,
  zabbix16-agent, and zabbix16-frontend.

20091206:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 0.11.1, which no longer enables kqemu by
  default (if built with KQEMU knob on), now you also have to explicitly
  pass -enable-kqemu (or -kernel-kqemu as with the previous versions)
  if you want to use it.  Also note the 0.11 stable branch is the last
  qemu branch that still supports kqemu, so if you depend on reasonably
  fast emulation on FreeBSD you should start looking for alternatives
  some time soon.  (VirtualBox?)

20091120:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfixadmin
  AUTHOR: Terry Sposato <tabmow@freenode.net>

  Due to a bug in the previous postfixadmin port, existing users need to
  backup their config.inc.php before they upgrade to postfixadmin-2.3 or
  later and put it in place after the upgrade is complete.

20091120:
  AFFECTS: users of security/f-prot
  AUTHOR: Tim Bishop <tdb@FreeBSD.org>

  The main f-prot command is now named fpscan.  Virus definitions are
  updated using the fpupdate command.  fpupdate will automatically run
  from periodic every day.  To disable set the following option in
  /etc/periodic.conf:

	fpupdate_enable="NO"

  The f-prot port now only works on i386.

20091118:
  AFFECTS: users of java/jboss5
  AUTHOR: Jonathan Chen <jonc@chen.org.nz>

  The JBoss directory structure has been reorganised to follow hier(7)
  guidelines more closely; in particular, transient and deployment files
  were moved to /var/jboss5, thus allowing /usr to be read-only.

20091118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/redmine
  AUTHOR: Bernhard Froehlich <decke@bluelife.at>

  After the upgrade you need to generate a session secret before restarting
  the application.  This is to protect you from cross-site request forgery.
  From your Redmine directory, simply run the following command once:

	# rake config/initializers/session_store.rb

  then upgrade as usual:

	# rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

20091114:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/win4bsd
  AUTHOR: Mario S F Ferreira <lioux@FreeBSD.org>

  The new port now depends on emulators/kqemu-kmod instead of installing
  its own version.  Therefore, you should make sure that no other kqemu.ko
  modules are installed:

	# pkg_delete -f win4bsd\*
  	# rm -f /boot/kernel/kqemu.ko
  	# pkg_delete -f kqemu-kmod\*
  	# portinstall emulators/win4bsd

  Do not forget to enable kqemu on rc.conf since win4bsd will not work
  without it.

20091018:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql54-server
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  After the upgrade the server may fail to start due to changes in the
  default values of innodb_log_files_in_group and innodb_log_file_size,
  which differ from those in earlier 5.4 releases.

  You should discard the old InnoDB log files and let MySQL 5.4.3 create
  new ones.  It is necessary to shut down your current server cleanly so
  that no outstanding transaction information remains in the log.

  See here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.4/en/news-5-4-3.html

  The XZ Utils distribution has superseded LZMA Utils, so the xz port has
  been added and the lzmautils ports have been removed.  To perform the
  move, run one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:

	# portupgrade -o archivers/xz lzmautils\*

  If using portmaster:

	# portmaster -o archivers/xz archivers/lzmautils
  or
	# portmaster -o archivers/xz archivers/lzmautils-devel

  as applicable.

  AFFECTS: users of www/epiphany, x11/yelp, graphics/librsvg2,
	   x11/toolkits/py-gnome-extras, and www/epiphany-extensions
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The default Gecko provider has been changed from www/firefox to
  www/libxul.  Firefox 2.x is now marked FORBIDDEN for security reasons,
  and libxul is new, stable, and preferred Gecko provider.  Libxul uses
  the same Gecko engine as Firefox 3.0.x.

  Some ports may fail to upgrade or run when both www/firefox and libxul
  are installed on the same system.  To make sure everything runs smoothly,
  uninstall www/firefox, then install libxul, then upgrade the affected
  ports.

20090915:

  AUTHOR: Denis Shaposhnikov <dsh@wizard.volgograd.ru>

  Please read the following:

    https://oss.gonicus.de/labs/gosa/wiki/DocumentationInstallingUpdatingGOsa

  before upgrading this port.  And don't forget to check your slapd.conf

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux-systemsimcell
  AUTHOR: stast@bsdportal.ru

  The port emulators/linux-systemsimcell has been updated to 3.1.25.
  Systemsimcell emulator now has a new dependency: x11-toolkits/linux-f10-blt.
  So you need to switch to linux-f10 ports in order to use 3.1.25 version.

  AFFECTS: users of astro/celestia and KDE
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  Celestia can now be compiled with KDE 3 frontend (you can enable it with
  CELESTIA_UI=kde when building).  It is very feature-rich, as it offers
  contextual menus, toolbars, KDE integration, internationalization,
  bookmarks, etc.  If you use Celestia and KDE as your desktop, you might
  want to rebuild the port so it integrates into your environment better.

20090815:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  Dovecot has been updated to version 1.2.3.  The configuration file has

20090804:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon*, x11/kdebase4*, deskutils/kdepim4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE 4 has been updated to version 4.3.0.  KDE now uses qt4-phonon;
  multimedia/phonon and multimedia/phonon-gstreamer are deprecated in
  favor of their qt4 equivalents.  You can still use multimedia/phonon-xine
  however.  A number of files have been moved between packages.  The
  recommended update procedure is to delete phonon, phonon-gstreamer,
  kdebase-*4*, kdepim-4*, then update ports as usual and install desired
  KDE 4 ports:

    # pkg_delete -f phonon-4\* phonon-gstreamer\* kdebase-\*4\* kdepim-4\*
    # portmaster -a (or portupgrade -a)
    # cd ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde4 && make config && make install clean

  Install qt4-designer if needed.

20090802:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libtool15 and devel/libltdl15
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/libtool15 and devel/libltdl15 ports have been moved to libtool22
  and libltdl22, respectively, then updated to 2.2.6a. You will need to run
  portmaster or portupgrade to properly perform the upgrade:

  If using portmaster:

	portmaster -o devel/libtool22 devel/libtool15
	portmaster -o devel/libltdl22 devel/libltdl15

  If using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o devel/libtool22 libtool-1.5\*
	portupgrade -o devel/libltdl22 libltdl-1.5\*

  After that, you will need to rebuild all ports that depend on libltdl.
  Since all dependent ports' PORTREVISIONs have been bumped, you can run
  portupgrade or portmaster with `-a' option to complete the upgrade.

20090801:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  An updated libdrm and xf86-video-nouveau have been committed.  These

  multimedia/mlt.

20090613:
  AFFECTS: users of www/hudson
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  Hudson is now running as a standalone process and no longer relies on
  Apache Tomcat.  As such, it should now be configured by defining
  hudson_* variables in rc.conf.  See comments from rc.d script for further
  details.

  The default setup is using the same port numbers and HTTP URL prefix as
  before in order to reduce the effort of upgrading the port.  Hence, it
  may conflict with some running Apache Tomcat instance.  To fix this
  problem, you may either deinstall www/tomcat6, or use the following
  settings in hudson_args from /etc/rc.conf:

    --httpPort=??? --ajp13Port=???

20090611:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Two rc.d scripts have been renamed:

	apache22.sh -> apache22
	htcacheclean.sh -> htcacheclean

  You'll need to update any crons wrappers, etc. for the new paths.

20090608:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python* and py-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Python has been changed from 2.5.x to 2.6.x.
  If you have 2.5.x installed, perform an upgrade of lang/python25 to
  lang/python26 with one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python26 lang/python25

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python26 lang/python25

  If you want to retain 2.5.x as default Python version, set the
  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION variable to 'python2.5' (without quotes) in
  /etc/make.conf, then go to lang/python and perform the following
  command:

  # portupgrade -R python

  Once the installed Python has been updated to 2.6, by using the
  method above, it is required to run the upgrade-site-packages target in
  lang/python to assure that site-packages are made available to the new
  Python version.

  If using portupgrade:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  If using portmaster:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages -DUSE_PORTMASTER

  The portmaster case can take quite some time to complete due to the lack of
  cached information that the portupgrade suite uses (specifically pkg_which).
  This is not the fault of portmaster.

20090606:
  AFFECTS: users of java/eclipse
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The update to 3.4.2 changes the location of the metadata for eclipse to
  be more in line with what is used on other platforms.  This means that
  after the update plugins that have been installed by a user with the
  built in Update Manager will need to be reinstalled.

20090605:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  Version 2.6.1 introduced a POLA violation by expecting aliases.db to be
  in /etc/mail/aliases.db (not /etc/aliases.db).  With this version the
  location is reverted to the right place.

  If you updated your installation to 2.6.1 you need to run newaliases(1)
  again after you installed 2.6.2.

20090603:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/font-mplus-ipa (and old japanese/ipa-ttfonts)
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  IPAUIGothic has been updated to a version included in IPA font
  version 002.03 and added as a separated port
  "japanese/font-ipa-uigothic".  And the font-mplus-ipa has been
  updated to remove the old IPAUIGothic.

  Thus the old ipa-ttfonts is almost equivalent to font-ipa +
  font-ipa-uigothic + font-mplus-ipa.  Note that these three packages
  have different licenses from each other.

20090601:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/cvs-devel
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  cvs-devel no longer installs /bin/cvs and /bin/cvsbug. These are now

  of this change with respect to your path.

20090531:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/viewvc
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  viewvc.conf and templates are not compatible to 1.0.x version, even the
  database scripts have changed.  For details see:

20090530:
  AFFECTS: users of Japanese and Chinese fonts
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Ports for Japanese fonts have been reorganized in the following way:

	japanese/ipa-ttfonts -> japanese/font-mplus-ipa
	japanese/ipa-ttfonts -> japanese/font-ipa
	japanese/kochi-ttfonts -> japanese/font-kochi
	japanese/mplusfonts -> japanese/font-mplus
	japanese/sazanami-ttf -> japanese/font-sazanami
	japanese/shinonome -> japanese/font-shinonome
	japanese/umefont -> japanese/font-ume
	japanese/vlgothic -> japanese/font-vlgothic

  While basically these are port name changes for consistency,
  installation directories are also changed:

	font files -> ${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}/*
	symlinks -> ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/{TTF,OTF,fontname,...}/*
	symlinks -> ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/{TTF,OTF,misc,fontname,...}/*

  A user-visible one is that the directory name "TrueType" is replaced
  with "TTF".

  Also, japanese/font-std and chinese/font-std have been added as
  standard fonts used in the Ports Collection.  Currently they
  contain:

	std.ja_JP/Mincho
	std.ja_JP/Gothic
	std.ja_JP/Ryumin-Light
	std.ja_JP/GothicBBB-Medium
	std.zh_CN/STHeiti-Regular
	std.zh_CN/STSong-Light
	std.zh_CN/MSung-Light
	std.zh_CN/MHei-Medium

  under ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/.  They are just symlinks to
  corresponding font files.  The symlink names are based on popular
  PostScript font names.

  Applications should refer the font files via XLFD or fontconfig
  first.  If they need a direct reference to the font file, please use
  files in std.*/*.  This is because direct reference to a specific
  font name in an application configuration file makes the maintenance
  difficult when the font file name is changed, for example.

20090516:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/viewvc
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  OPTION APACHE2 has been changed to APACHE (WITH_APACHE)
  WITH_APACHE2 is deprecated and is being removed.
  APACHE_PORT will be pulled in when WITH_APACHE is selected

20090516:
  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-base and portupgrade
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The print/cups port has been split into multiple ports.  If upgrading
  from 1.3.10_1 and below, you must remove the installed version first.

20090412:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bacula-server
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/bacula-server now uses a new catalog format.  If upgrading

  provided with the port before restarting bacula.

20090410:
  AFFECTS: users of www/trac-email2trac
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  bin/email2trac.py and bin/delete_spam.py are now installed without the
  .py extension to make the suid run_email2trac work and match the online
  documentation.  If you were using them in scripts or alias entries, you
  will need to update paths accordingly.

20090401:
  AFFECTS: users of Fedora 8 Linux infrastructure ports
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  ATTENTION! Those ports are not default for any version of FreeBSD for now
  and may be used with FreeBSD versions 7.2 and above (8-CURRENT is better)
  using compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 and linux_base-f8. Please, note that
  2.6.16 is not fully supported on 7.x (ex., some syscalls are missing
  and cannot be MFCed due to a native FreeBSD ABI breakage).

  For more information about transition please read item "20070327: AFFECTS:
  users of emulators/linux_base-fc6". That note may be used for upgrading
  to linux_base-f8 and Fedora 8 Linux infrastructure ports as well.

  If you want to switch to linux-f8 ports, please define at /etc/make.conf:

	OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f8
	OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f8

20090328:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.10 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.8, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.10):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.10 -f perl-5.8.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portmaster -o lang/perl5.10 lang/perl5.8
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches  more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20090327:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  After version 0.95 clamav-milter does not accept parameters by command
  line.  If you are using $clamav_milter_flags on rc.conf to set its
  parameters you will need to move to new ${PREFIX}/etc/clamav-milter.conf.

20090319:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash3
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  With the addition of shells/bash version 4.x, people wanting to stick
  with bash 3.x should perform the following update:

	$ portupgrade -f -o shells/bash3 bash

20090318:
  AFFECTS: users of www/suphp
  AUTHOR: yzlin@cs.nctu.edu.tw

  The suPHP port has been upgraded to 0.7.x. This new version of suPHP has
  some new features and changes for the configuration file:

    - Multiple path (with patterns) & variable substitution support for
      docroots
    - Double-quoted strings at section '[handlers]'
      ex. application/x-httpd-php="php:/usr/local/bin/php-cgi"

  These changes may lead to internal server error if without modifications
  of the configuration file from previous version.

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of www/geeklog
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  To follow the standards this port has received a small reworking.

  WWW_DIR (that defaulted to PREFIX/www/data/geeklog) is deprecated,
  use WWWDIR (defaults to PREFIX/www/geeklog).

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: skylord@linkline.ru

  ejabberd's UID and GID have changed (PR ports/105122). Users are advised
  to check all configuration files and data in /var/spool/ejabberd to
  ensure everything has the correct owner/group.

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/lire
  AUTHOR: edwin@FreeBSD.org

  Lire now requires DBD::SQLite, which uses SQLite 3.0.  This means that the
  Lire database format has changed.  If you have one or more old Lire stores,
  you will need to convert each of them from SQLite2 format to SQLite3 like
  this:

	$ sqlite oldstore.db .dump | sqlite3 newstore.db

  This assumes that you have both SQLite2 and SQLite3 installed on your
  system, and that the names of the command line interface for the old and
  new version are `sqlite' and `sqlite3' respectively (this is at least
  correct for Fedora).

20090310:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mythtv
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The upgrade from version 0.20 to version 0.21 should be transparent.
  Any changes to the database structure should be applied automatically.

  However, it is strongly recommended that you back up your database before
  installing a new version of MythTV.

  For example:

	$ mysqldump -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -c > mythtv_backup.sql

  To restore (assuming that you've dropped the database):

	$ mysql -u root
	mysql>create database mythconverg;
	mysql>exit
	$ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < mythtv_backup.sql

20090309:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libusb on CURRENT
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  FreeBSD libusb20 was renamed to libusb in r189585 and thus, being fully
  compatible with libusb20, replaces devel/libusb on HEAD.  devel/libusb
  should not be used on these systems.  Users of libusb-dependent ports
  are advised to remove libusb package from their systems, and rebuild all
  libusb dependencies.  One of the possible ways to achieve this is
  listed below:

	# set tempfile=`mktemp /tmp/usbports.XX`
	# pkg_info -qR /var/db/pkg/libusb-* > ${tempfile}
	# pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/libusb-*
	# cat ${tempfile} | xargs portupgrade -f
	# rm -f ${tempfile}

20090309:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/phonon port has been split into phonon itself, phonon-xine,
  and phonon-gstreamer backends.  After updating phonon port you have
  to install at least one backend; phonon-xine backend is recommended
  for KDE.

20090308:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 0.10.0, which now uses the newer
  (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade emulators/qemu
  with the KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20090304:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/py-gammu
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  The port comms/py-gammu was incorporated into comms/gammu since
  1.23.0. Delete comms/py-gammu first and then deinstall/reinstall
  comms/gammu with option WITH_PYTHON_GAMMU=YES.

20090304:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xfce4
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading from Xfce 4.4 to 4.6 make sure you uninstall the following
  ports:

	x11/libxfce4mcs
	sysutils/xfce4-mcs-manager
	sysutils/xfce4-mcs-plugins
	x11-themes/xfce4-icon-theme

  You may uninstall them before you start the upgrade procedure (preferred)
  or even afterwards when the upgrade went fine.

  Please also note that Xfce 4.6 does not come with an icon theme any more.
  Xfce 4.6 now depends on the Tango theme which is now installed by default.
  The default installation of Xfce is also adjusted to use this icon theme
  instead of the Xfce 4.4 standard Rodent theme.  If you are upgrading from
  Xfce 4.4 to 4.6 you probably still have the Rodent theme selected.  This
  will lead to several "missing" icons when starting up Xfce.

  Make sure to switch as well to the Tango theme.  To do this just open the
  Settings Manager and select Appearance.  Inside the Appearance dialog
  switch to the Icons tab and select the "Tango" entry in the list on the
  left side of the Icons tab.

  For enabling the Reboot/Shutdown functionality of Xfce's logout dialog
  please read the note which gets printed out after the installation of
  x11-wm/xfce4 about how to configure PolicyKit.

20090223:
  AFFECTS: users of Tcl/Tk
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Tcl/Tk has been changed from 8.4 to 8.5.

  To restore old behavior and prefer using Tcl 8.4 with supported ports set
  WITH_TCL_VER=84 in /etc/make.conf. This has no effect on ports that have
  USE_TCL=yes or USE_TK=yes. They stick to the new default version and have
  to be updated by their maintainers to support other versions than default.

  AFFECTS: users of www/zend-framework
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was fixed in Zend Framework
  1.7.5. The LFI was present in the Zend_View::render() method, and
  allowed inclusion of scripts with relative path names, e.g.
  "../../../my/script/dir/myscript.php".

  If the script path name is hard-coded into the application and is not
  generated by user input, the vulnerability does not apply.  Because of
  this exception, the Zend Framework team has added a flag to disable
  the LFI protection in the render() method.

  Full details of the vulnerability, whether it applies to your
  application and how to disable the LFI protection in the render()
  method can be found here:

  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP has been upgraded to 2.4.14, which requires a shared library
  version bump.  Therefore you need to reinstall all ports that depend on
  it.  Please do something like:

	# portupgrade -fr net/openldap24-client

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon, x11/kdelibs4, x11/kdebase4*,
  deskutils/kdepimlib4, deskutils/kdepim4, devel/automoc4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE 4 has been updated from 4.1.4 to 4.2.0.  A number of applications
  have been moved between packages.  The easiest way to avoid various
  problems during update is to delete all KDE-4.1.4 ports and install
  KDE-4.2.0:

	# pkg_delete -f kde\*4.1.4\* automoc4-\*
	# portmaster -a (or portupgrade -a)
	# cd ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde4 && make config && make install clean

20090207:

  devel/libslang has been removed in favor of devel/libslang2 after not
  being released during last five years.  WITH_SLANG2 is no longer a
  valid ports KNOB.  All ports that depend on devel/libslang should be
  recompiled, e.g.:

	# portupgrade -o devel/libslang2 devel/libslang

  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/hal has been updated and should now properly detect mice for

  users and moused should now work fine.

20090123:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  If you are using an older xorg.conf several config lines are no longer
  needed and will generate warnings when X is started.  RgbPath will cause
  X to fail to start, remove it from your config.

  Server 1.5.3 also really wants to configure its input devices via hald.
  This is causing some issues with moused and /dev/sysmouse.  There are
  couple of options for how to deal with it:

  1. Add Option "AllowEmptyInput" "off" to your ServerLayout section.
     This will cause X to use the configured kbd, mouse, and vmmouse
     sections from your xorg.conf

  2. Don't use moused.  If you want it to work with addon USB mice
     set this in rc.conf:

	moused_enable="NO"
	moused_nondefault_enable="NO"

  I'm working on fixing hald or the mouse driver or both.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/claws-mail, mail/claws-mail-smime
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The claws-mail port includes the S/MIME plugin itself now, it is not
  distributed as a separate plugin anymore. It can be enabled with the
  GPGME option in the port (disabled by default). If you use the S/MIME
  plugin, you should remove the mail/claws-mail-smime port before
  enabling GPGME and updating the mail/claws-mail port. People which
  already updated mail/claws-mail with GPGME enabled and a non-working
  S/MIME plugin need to deinstall mail/claws-mail-smime and reinstall
  mail/claws-mail.

20090118:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Deluge has been updated from 0.5.x to 1.x. The 1.x has been rewritten,
  so it is recommend for you to make the back up of your ~/.config/deluge. The
  configuration and plugins of 0.5.x do not work in 1.x. Deluge will picking
  up the old configuration and try to convert it to the newer format, but I
  wouldn't trust it to do it without the back up.

  If you prefer to stick with 0.5.x, you can use portmaster:

  	# portmaster -o net-p2p/deluge05 net-p2p/deluge

  or if you use portupgrade:

	# portupgrade -o net-p2p/deluge05 net-p2p/deluge

  AFFECTS: users of GNOME and GTK+
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.24.x.  You have to deinstall a few ports
  first before using portupgrade or portmaster in order to successfully
  upgrade your GNOME installation.  After successful upgrade, you have
  to reinstall gnome-session so the gnome.desktop session file is properly
  installed.

  Portupgrade users:

	# pkgdb -Ff
	(Answer "yes" to unregister gail while keeping gtk20.)
	(Answer "yes" to unregister fast-user-switch-applet while
	 keeping gdm.)

	# pkg_deinstall -fO gtkmm-2.12\*

  by default.  Themes were have also been split to an extra port which
  your can find under x11-themes/claws-mail-themes.  Menu was rewritten
  entirely in version 3.6.0 using modern GTK interface; as a consequence,
  all your custom shortcuts will be lost after upgrade.

20090109:
  AFFECTS: users of any Mozilla and Opera products
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Java plugins now will no longer be picked up by automatically from
  these browsers.  Because all Java ports share the name of plugins file,
  I am thinking about someone or maybe me will need to write something
  similar to nspluginwrapper (but in shell script) that can add Java plugin
  in ~/.*/plugins/ when user requests one specific version of Java plugin
  if this user has more than one version of Java installed.  However, for
  now, you will have to add Java plugin in ~/.*/plugins/ manually.

20090107:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/unixODBC
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/unixODBC port has been updated to 2.2.14.  While
  containing many bug fixes and minor feature adjustments, this version
  no longer ships with the (obsolete) MySQL ODBC driver.  MySQL ODBC
  driver users will probably want to use databases/mysql-connector-odbc
  instead.  The text-backed/flatfile driver (libtxtodbc) has also been
  removed by the developers but due to some demand may make a return in
  a future version or as a separate port.

  The Wnn backend of japanese/kinput2 port now uses unix domain socket
  to communicate the server by default.  If $JSERVER environment
  variable is defined, the value is used as the server host name.  In
  In short, the server name is determined in the following way:

  $JSERVER --(if null)--> CcWnn.Jserver --(if null)--> "localhost"

  If the server host name is null or matches "^unix$", unix domain
  socket is used.  Note that the default server name in CcWnn.Jserver
  is "unix" now.

  As of PHP 5.2.7, pcre extension is distributed with the core PHP5 package,
  and not as a standalone module anymore.  Follow the steps below to update
  your installation.

  Portupgrade users:

	pkg_delete -f php5-pcre-5.2.6
	pkgdb -F
	portupgrade as usual

  Portmaster users:

	pkg_delete -f php5-pcre\*
	portmaster php5

  If you are using pecl ports you might need to force an update on them:

	portupgrade -f pecl\*
  or
	portmaster pecl

  If you have the pecl hash, json and/or zip extensions you need to replace
  them with the PHP5 bundled ones, e.g.:

	portmaster/portupgrade -o archivers/php5-zip archivers/pecl-zip
	portmaster/portupgrade -o devel/php5-json devel/pecl-json
	portmaster/portupgrade -o security/php5-hash security/pecl-hash

  If you build your INDEX locally and you tried to build it after the PHP
  update commit, you need to rebuild it _after_ you updated lang/php5:

	cd /usr/ports && make index

  or (if you use ports-mgmt/p5-FreeBSD-Portindex):

	cd /usr/ports && cache-init && portindex -o `make -V INDEXFILE`

  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The startup script of comms/smstools3 has changed. For increased security
  smstools now runs as user uucp / group dialer by default. The script
  commands like sendsms etc. should be executed as user uucp.
  To restore the old behaviour, set smsd_user="root" and smsd_group="wheel"

20081108:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/tamago
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The Wnn backend of editors/tamago port now uses unix domain socket
  to communicate the server by default.  If $[CJKT]SERVER environment
  variable is defined, the value is used as the server host name.  In
  JSERVER case, for example, the server name is determined in the
  following way:

	$JSERVER --(if null)--> wnn-jserver --(if null)--> "unix"

  If the server host name is null or matches "^unix$", unix domain
  socket is used.  The path name of the socket can be specified in

  AFFECTS: users of japanese/FreeWnn-server
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The jserver daemon in japanese/FreeWnn-server port now uses "127.0.0.1"
  as the default listen address for security reason.  If you need
  the wildcard address (INADDR_ANY), you have to explicitly set
  "listenaddr" to 0.0.0.0 in ${PREFIX}/lib/wnn/ja_JP/jserverrc or

  AFFECTS: users of www/codeigniter
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  For certain installations, the following steps should be performed
  after the CodeIgniter 1.7.0 upgrade (taken from:
  http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/upgrade_170.html).

  >>> Update your Session Table

  If you are using the Session class in your application, AND if you
  are storing session data to a database, you must add a new column
  named user_data to your session table. Here is an example of what
  this column might look like for MySQL:

	user_data text NOT NULL

  To add this column you will run a query similar to this:

	ALTER TABLE `ci_sessions` ADD `user_data` text NOT NULL

  You'll find more information regarding the new Session functionality
  in the Session class page:

	http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html

  >>> Update your Validation Syntax

  This is an optional, but recommended step, for people currently
  using the Validation class. CI 1.7 introduces a new Form Validation
  class (http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/form_validation.html)
  which deprecates the old Validation library. We have left the old one
  in place so that existing applications that use it will not break, but
  you are encouraged to migrate to the new version as soon as possible.
  Please read the user guide carefully as the new library works a little
  differently, and has several new features.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/sj3-server
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The sj3serv daemon in japanese/sj3-server port now uses "localhost"
  as the default listen address for security reason.  If you need
  the wildcard address (INADDR_ANY), you have to explicitly set
  "servername" to 0.0.0.0 in ${PREFIX}/etc/sj3/serverrc.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3 port have been split into
  japanese/canna-server and japanese/canna-lib, and japanese/sj3-server
  and japanese/sj3-lib, respectively for more fine-grained dependency
  management in the Ports Collection.

20080926:

  The Squid developers decided to disable COSS support in 3.0, cf.
  the discussion starting here:

	http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-dev/200809/0067.html

  The corresponding port configuration option WITH_SQUID_COSS is still
  available but is a no-op for now.  If you currently use COSS storage with
  Squid 3.0 you need to disable it in squid.conf.

20080924:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  proftpd now stores its .delay and .scoreboard files in /var/run/proftpd
  instead of /var/run.  If you are updating an existing installation,
  adjust the following in /usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf:

	ScoreboardFile	/var/run/proftpd/proftpd.scoreboard

  Also of note: The third party modules, mod_codeconv, mod_comb, and
  mod_sql_tds are not compatible with this release and have been removed.
  They will be re-added when the respective authors provide updated versions.

20080909:
  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  logcheck now stores its configuration files in /usr/local/etc/logcheck
  instead of /usr/local/etc.  If you are upgrading the port from version
  1.1.1 to version 1.2.54, copy the following files to a temporary location,
  in case they are removed during the upgrade:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.hacking
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.ignore
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations.ignore

  e.g.:

	cd /usr/local/etc
	mkdir /tmp/logcheck.saveconf
	cp logcheck.hacking logcheck.ignore logcheck.violations* \
	   /tmp/logcheck.saveconf

  After the upgrade, integrate your local changes to the files listed
  above into the new configuration files found in the following directories:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/cracking.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.paranoid
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.workstation
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.ignore.d

  Please consult the following files for more information about
  logcheck rules and reporting levels:

	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck
	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck-database

  Also note that the upgraded port installs a crontab file for user
  "logcheck" that executes the logcheck script every hour and emails
  the results to root.  If the installation process cannot install
  the crontab file, it can be installed manually from
  /usr/local/share/examples/logcheck/crontab.in, e.g.:

	crontab -u logcheck /usr/local/share/examples/logcheck/crontab.in

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nagios and net-mgmt/nagios-devel
  AUTHOR: Jarrod Sayers <jarrod@netleader.com.au>

  The stable Nagios port has now been updated to version 3.0.3.  Upgrading
  to this version shouldn't require any configuration changes, but note that
  most sample configuration files were moved into objects/ directory.

  Nagios 2.12 is still available as net-mgmt/nagios2, use the following to
  remain on this legacy stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  Nagios 3.x development continues in net-mgmt/nagios-devel, users of this
  port in production use should consider switching to the stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

  a git subcommand as "git-xyzzy" from the command line has been deprecated
  since early 2006 (and officially announced in 1.5.4 release notes); use
  of them from your scripts after adding output from "git --exec-path" to
  the $PATH is still supported in this release, but users are again
  strongly encouraged to adjust their scripts to use "git xyzzy" form, as
  we will stop installing "git-xyzzy" hardlinks for built-in commands in
  later releases.

  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: pneumann@gmail.com

  The database schema has changed in this version of RabbitMQ.  If you
  attempt to start RabbitMQ-1.4.0 over top of a previous installation,
  it will fail, citing "schema_integrity_check_failed".  To correct this,
  delete your mnesia directory (/var/db/rabbitmq/mnesia) and restart
  the server.  Note that this will destroy all your durable exchanges and
  queues, and all your persisted messages!

20080816:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/assp
  AUTHOR: J.R. Oldroyd <fbsd@opal.com>

  The periodic(8) script no longer outputs to files in the assp directory.
  You should remove /var/db/assp/nightly.log and nightly.log.old by hand
  once you are done with them.  The information that was stored there will
  now come in your nightly system email.

20080815:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/rdiff-backup
  AUTHOR: vd@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/rdiff-backup has been upgraded from 1.0.5 to 1.2.0.  This is
  an incompatible upgrade.  If you need the "old" 1.0.5, you can find it
  in sysutils/rdiff-backup10.

20080813:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  The layout of the ikiwiki.setup file has changed in a significant
  way in this release.  Old setup files will continue to work, but new
  features, like the new websetup interface, require a new format
  setup file.  You can convert old setup files into the new format by
  running the following command for all your ikiwiki.setup files:

	ikiwiki-transition setupformat ikiwiki.setup

20080812:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamdyke
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The spamdyke port has been updated to 4.0.2.  The new version is not
  backwards compatible with previous versions.  Please examine the new
  configuration file for the changes.

20080812:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/pgbouncer
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with port version 1.2.3, pgbouncer does not run as root anymore.
  If you are upgrading from earlier versions, please update your configuration
  in ${PREFIX}/etc/pgbouncer.ini to use log and pid file paths owned by the
  newly created pgbouncer user (or customize for a different user yourself).

  Default logfile: /var/log/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.log
  Default pidfile: /var/run/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.pid

20080808:
  AFFECTS: users of chinese/phpbb-tw
  AUTHOR: chinsan@FreeBSD.org

  The default install directory for phpbb-tw has changed from
  ${PREFIX}/www/data/phpBB2 to ${PREFIX}/www/phpBB2.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your settings
  and data, please do the following:

  Then update as usual.

20080806:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Update to 1.3x, the net-p2p/transmission now is a meta-port. It depends on
  cli, daemon, and gtk2. If you don't want that, uninstall transmission and
  install net-p2p/transmission-cli by doing:

	portmaster -o net-p2p/transmission-cli net-p2p/transmission

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-p2p/transmission-cli net-p2p/transmission

20080805:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/qt4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The Qt 4 ports has been updated to 4.4.1.  With this update several ports
  specific problems have been fixed.  Qt 4 headers and libraries have been
  moved to include/qt4 and lib/qt4.  bsd.qt.mk defines QT_INCDIR and
  QT_LIBDIR now, which could be used in qt4-dependent ports if required.
  Before you start to update your ports, please force update of qmake4 and
  qt4-corelib ports.  Portmaster users can do:

	portmaster devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

20080804:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  Git's cvsps dependency has been switched from cvsps-devel to cvsps.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following before
  upgrading git:

	portmaster -o devel/cvsps devel/cvsps-devel

20080728:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius2
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  Upgrading the FreeRADIUS port used to replace all unmodified files
  in your configuration with the latest version from the sample
  configuration. This strategy has two disadvantages; over time your
  configuration became based on different versions of the sample
  configuration, also major changes to the sample configuration could
  leave your configuration in a confusing state.

  From version 2.0.5, your configuration is not touched if any
  configuration files have been modified.

  You are recommended to track changes in the sample configuration and
  keep your configuration in a version control system. I use Subversion
  (see the devel/subversion port) to track my changes. Keeping the sample
  configuration in a 'vendor branch' (see the Subversion book for more
  details) allows easy merging of changes from the sample configuration.

  *** IMPORTANT ***

  You are urged to move your configuration out of the default location
  (/usr/local/etc/raddb) before upgrading from 2.0.4 (or earlier)
  to 2.0.5 (or later). Once this upgrade is complete, remove the sample
  configuration that has been installed in the default location and
  move your configuration back to the default location.

  This is a one time procedure that will prevent unmodified files in
  your configuration from being deleted from your configuration and not
  restored during the upgrade. No customised files will be lost in any
  circumstances.

  The sample configuration in 2.0.5 has been reorganised: the
  configuration of most modules is now in the modules directory rather
  than in radiusd.conf. You are urged to rearrange your configuration
  to match this layout.

  There are several improvements in this version of the port, including
  a new pkg-message that will help new FreeRADIUS users to get started
  with the port, also new 'reload' and 'debug' commands for the rc.d
  script. Enjoy!

20080725:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fm/nautilus and misc/shared-mime-info
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  In order to properly update x11-fm/nautilus and misc/shared-mime-info, do
  the following using portupgrade:

	# pkg_deinstall -fO nautilus
	# portupgrade shared-mime-info
	# portinstall -O nautilus

  Once misc/shared-mime-info has been updated, each user will need to run
  the following command:

	$ update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/

20080725:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ojs2
  AUTHOR: Greg Larkin <glarkin@FreeBSD.org>

  If you are upgrading from a prior version of ojs2, please backup your
  database, uploaded files directory, and your config.inc.php before the
  upgrade.  Read /usr/local/share/docs/ojs2/UPGRADE or visit
  http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/UPGRADE for additional upgrade information.

20080721:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freenet6
  AUTHOR: Edwin Groothuis <edwin@mavetju.org>

  Please note that there has been a major update of this port (from
  version 2.x to 5.x) and that the name of the binaries and configuration
  files has changed from "tpsc" to "gw6c". The configuration files
  have to be copied from ${PREFIX}/share/examples/freenet6 to
  ${PREFIX}/etc again.

20080719:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fm/gprename
  AUTHOR: Martin Tournoij <carpetsmoker@rwxrwxrwx.net>

  GPRename configuration files now live ~/.config/gprename instead of ~/, to
  upgrade use the following commands:

	% mkdir -p ~/.config/gprename
	% mv ~/.gprename ~/.config/gprename/gprename
	% mv ~/.gprename_log ~/.config/gprename/gprename_log

20080717:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/anjuta
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Anjuta's neon dependency has been switched from neon26 to neon28.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following to upgrade:

	portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26
	portupgrade anjuta

20080714:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: Thomas-Martin Seck <tmseck@web.de>

  www/squid has been updated to Squid 2.7.STABLE3.

  The update should be rather straightforward.

  The only noticeable change in the port is that the ICAP patch is no
  longer included; this is because this patch was unmaintained for a long
  time and its use was not really recommended.  Please consider moving to
  Squid-3 (currently available as www/squid30) if you need ICAP support.

  Squid 2.6 is still available as www/squid26 and will probably be removed
  from the Ports Tree by the end of 2008.

20080712:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/rrdtool
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  If you use language bindings, like the Perl's RRDs, please upgrade
  this port *twice* in order to get the library dependency right.

20080711:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  The port has been deprecated and gtkdatabox has been updated. This was
  done so the port tracks vendor name. Please update by doing:

	portupgrade -o x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2

20080709:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki editpage form now uses the raw page name, not the page title,
  in its `page' CGI parameter.  You will need to rebuild any existing
  IkiWiki installations in order to update their `edit' links to the new
  format.

20080708:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-devel
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to a 20080620 SVN snapshot, which uses the
  new (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade qemu-devel with the
  KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20080705:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki search plug-in now uses www/xapian-omega as backend instead
  of textproc/hyperestraier.  You will need to update the configuration of
  any search enabled IkiWiki installations and rebuild them since the
  search form has changed.

20080704:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/shared-mime-info
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The misc/shared-mime-info has been updated to 0.40. The Mime Types caches
  have been changed a bit. If you have created any custom MIME types, you
  will need to run update-mime-database to update your local Mime Types
  caches:

	$ update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ratbox-services
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Configuration file and database changes have been made between the
  1.1.x series and the current release version of ratbox-services.

  It is highly recommended that services are stopped, and the proper
  upgrade procedure is followed as described in port's documentation,
  before restarting newly updated ratbox-services again.

  Please remember to backup the database before attempting an
  upgrade, as incorrectly upgraded database may be rendered unusable.

  The ratbox-services-1.2.x branch implements multi-language support.
  However, an inconsistency in the language indexing may result in
  errors. It is therefore recommended that the English default to be
  used until the next version release.

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/nocc
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  The Nocc configuration file has been moved into 'config' subdir.
  When updating, remove the old conf.php file and reconfigure Nocc.

20080701:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion*
  AUTHOR: Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>

  subversion now uses neon-0.28.x (www/neon28) port, and automatic
  portupgrade will fail because www/neon28 will conflict with installed
  www/neon26 port.

  You should upgrade neon library before subversion with the command:

	# portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26

  Also, if you use any special subversion ports with bindings, you
  should upgrade these ports to clean subversion port with

	# portupgrade -o devel/subversion subversion-\*

  and install needed bindings (p5-subversion, py-subversion and/or
  ruby-subversion) after that.

  If you use subversion with bindings installed from devel/subversion
  with custom options, don't forget to install separate bindings ports
  after subversion upgrade.

20080630:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/cairo, graphics/poppler*, and future users of www/firefox3
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The poppler* ports have been updated to 0.8.3 and the shared libraries
  have changed.  Firefox 3.0 has been added to the tree as www/firefox3.
  These changes require that all dependent ports be updated.  You can do
  this in one of two ways:

	# portmaster pixman
	# portmaster \*cairo\*
	# portmaster -r poppler-0

  or:

	# pkgdb -Ff
	# portupgrade pixman\* \*cairo\*
	# portupgrade -r poppler-0.\*

20080627:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati
  AUTHOR: Jung-uk Kim <jkim@FreeBSD.org>

  mach64 and r128 drivers are now separated out from the ati driver.
  These video cards are supported by x11-drivers/xf86-video-mach64
  and x11-drivers/xf86-video-r128 respectively. If you have one of
  the affected video cards and xorg.conf contains the following line:

	Driver	"ati"

  you must specify "mach64" or "r128". Alternatively, you may install
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati to get a wrapper driver.

20080626:
  AFFECTS: users of science/gramps
  AUTHOR: Anders Troback <freebsd@troback.com>

  Before you upgrade from 2.x to 3.x you need to export your existing
  databases to a GRAMPS XML file. After the upgrade you can import

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ircd-ratbox-devel
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Upgrading between different beta releases can cause problems when
  changes to the ban database schema have occurred.  The 'bantool'
  utility now comes with a -u switch that will check and update the
  ban database as necessary.

  Issuing 'bantool -u' is required when upgrading between beta releases
  and must not be done while the ircd is running.

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security
  AUTHOR: Marcelo Araujo <araujo@FreeBSD.org>

  The mod_security port has been updated from 1.9.4 to 2.5.5. Branch 1.9.x
  will not receive any further updates; all users must update mod_security
  port to versions 2.1 or 2.5.

  AFFECTS: users of www/opera and www/opera/devel
  AUTHOR: Ion-Mihai Tetcu <itetcu@FreeBSD.org>

  The Opera port has been updated from 9.2x to 9.5x.  A lot of things have
  been changed such as keyboard shortcuts[1]; new storage and indexing
  formats for mail and feeds; new search.ini; native amd64 binaries; no 4.x
  support.  You will be asked whether to convert mail and feeds to new
  format during start up.  Warning: there is no way to downgrade back to

	   with apr from www/apache22
  AUTHOR: Clement Laforet <clement@FreeBSD.org>

  apr and apr-util bundled with apache 2.2.9 have been upgraded to 1.3.x, so
  shared libraries versions have been bumped. If you are using subversion
  with apache22 apr, you must rebuild subversion after the update.

20080617:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/nvi-devel
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  editors/nvi-devel has been changed to install nvi, nex, and nview as
  to not conflict with editors/2bsd-vi.  Please note the new names if
  you use this port.

20080616:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dkim-milter
  AUTHOR: Hirohisa Yamaguchi <umq@ueo.co.jp>

  Most of the command line options can now be set in configure files.
  So the default values (such as milterdkim_socket) are changed to blank.
  Upgrading users should check the values both in rc.conf and
  dkim-filter.conf.

20080612:
  AFFECTS: users of www/linux-opera
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Opera port has been updated from 9.2x to 9.5x.  A lot of things have
  been changed such as keyboard shortcuts[1]; new storage and indexing
  formats for mail and feeds; new search.ini; probably more that I have
  missed.  I do not know if the keyboard shortcuts and search.ini will be
  overwritten.  You will be asked whether you want mail and feeds to be
  converted to new format during start up.  Warning: there is no way to
  downgrade back to the old format.  Be sure to see the Changelog[2].

  [1] http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/884/
  [2] http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/950/

  It is probably best for you to back up your linux-opera directory in
  case until you have no problem with new Opera for a while.  Also, you
  might have to re-configure search and keyboard shortcuts if these were
  overwritten:

	# cp -Rp ~/.linux-opera ~/.linux-opera-bak

  If you are seeing an error of undefined symbols related to GTK+, it is
  because it needs newer linux-gtk2 that ports doesn't have. You can enter
  'opera:config#FileSelector|DialogToolkit' in the address bar and change
  from 0 to 1 in 'Dialog Toolkit' if it annoys you.  0 = auto detection,
  1 = QT, and 2 = GTK+.

20080610:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/svnmailer
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Some of the config directives and sections allowed have changed.  You will

  volume control tool to PulseAudio.

20080605:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of the upgrade to gettext-0.17, the shared library version
  of libintl has changed, so you will need to rebuild all ports that
  depend on gettext:

	# portupgrade -rf gettext
	# portmaster -r gettext

  Given the scope and sheer number of dependent ports, it may be more
  advisable to simply blow away all existing install ports (after
  keeping any local configuration changes), and rebuilding from scratch.

20080603:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs
  AUTHOR: Yasuhiro KIMURA <yasu@utahime.org>

  The port (editors/emacs) is updated to 22.2 and some of Emacs Lisp
  directories had changed.  So you should reinstall all ports that depend
  on it.  Please do something like:

	# portupgrade -fr emacs

20080601:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  If password based logins is enabled in IkiWiki, those passwords were
  stored in cleartext in the userdb.  To guard against exposing users'
  passwords, IkiWiki 2.48 and later use strong (blowfish) hashes for
  storing passwords.

  To hash existing passwords, update to ikiwiki-2.48 and run the

20080513:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: scheidell@secnap.net

  Amavisd-new 2.6.0 introduces several incompatibilities with prior versions.
  If you are upgrading from 2.5.4 or earlier, you will need to update your
  SQL schema.  If you have third party programs that access SQL tables, you
  will need to update those also.

  COMPATIBILITY WITH 2.5.4:

  - when using SQL for logging (e.g. for a pen pals feature) or for
    quarantining, SQL tables maddr, msgs, msgrcpt and quarantine need
    to be extended by a new field 'partition_tag';  see below for details;

  - when SQL logging (pen pals) or SQL lookups are used, one can choose a
    binary or a character data type for fields users.email, mailaddr.email,
    and maddr.email; now may be a good opportunity to change a data type
    to binary (string of bytes);  see below for details;

  - when using SQL for logging, a default for $sql_clause{'upd_msg'}
    has changed, so if a configuration file replaces this SQL clause
    by a non-default setting, it needs to be updated;

  Full information in /usr/local/share/doc/amavisd-new/RELEASE_NOTES.

20080513:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/ampache
  AUTHOR: jadawin@FreeBSD.org

  Ampache 3.4 uses a different config parser.  Unfortunately the new parser
  is unable to read old config files.  In order to migrate your current

  the command line.

20080508:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/ptop
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The authors have changed the name of this utility to `pg_top'.  To avoid
  conflict with another port in the Tree with the same name we have retained
  `ptop' as the portname.  Note that binary has also changed to `pg_top'.
  Please start the utility with that name after updating.

20080507:
  AFFECTS: Perl interface users of audio/gramofile
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  Perl support is removed due to devel/swig11 removal in ports.  If you use

20080506:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/collectd
  AUTHOR: daniel@roe.ch

  Previously, net-mgmt/collectd used to remove the config file even if it
  was changed by the user. This has now been fixed.

  To upgrade without losing your configuration, copy
  ${PREFIX}/etc/collectd.conf away to a safe place before upgrading
  net-mgmt/collectd.

  In addition, the default location of the data files changed from

  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  Clamav 0.93 does not support the daily.inc and main.inc directories format
  for virus databases.  You need to remove these directories manually and
  force freshclam to get new cvd format files before starting clamd:

	portupgrade clamav
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/clamav-clamd stop
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/clamav-freshclam stop
	rm -rf /var/db/clamav/main.inc /var/db/clamav/daily.inc

  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-Apache-Test
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/p5-Apache-Test doesn't actually need www/mod_perl{1,2}. If you would
  like to test a mod_perl, than please install www/mod_perl2 or www/mod_perl
  as well. The ports infrastructure doesn't support this (yet) but you can
  use it to test www/apache13, www/apache20, and/or www/apache22 without
  chaining www/p5-Apache-Test.

  It is required with both skype and skype-devel to update to linux_base-fc6.
  Please do the following:

  1. Make sure there are no running Linux applications.
  2. Unmount linprocfs (umount /compat/linux/proc)
  3. Uninstall your current linux_base port
  4. Set appropriate sysctl (sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16)
  5. Install emulators/linux_base-fc6
  6  Remount linprocfs (mount /compat/linux/proc)
  7. Add compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 to etc/sysctl.conf
  8. Add OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=fc6 to /etc/make.conf

  Note: These instructions also apply to linux_base-f8, please use the same
  osrelease.

  For FreeBSD versions 5.X and 6.X:

  Please use the legacy version net/skype12:

	portupgrade -o net/skype12 net/skype

20080312:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/enlightenment-devel, x11/ecore and grephics/evas
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  Evas and ecore ports have been split to separate modules to simplify
  dependency tracking. Thus, portupgrade in many cases won't be able to
  correctly update these ports.

  The easiest upgrade path would be to remove all EFL ports and install
  them from scratch. At least, you should reinstall ecore and evas.

  Please note that your old $HOME/.e is no longer compatible with new
  snapshot version. You will need to remove this directory and let e17
  create it automatically on the next startup.

20080306:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The update to version 1.0.12 will require manual change to the active
  configuration file.

  mail_extra_groups setting was commonly used insecurely. This setting is now
  deprecated. Most users should switch to using mail_privileged_group setting,
  but if you really need the old functionality use mail_access_groups instead.

20080303:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  gnutls has been updated to 2.2.2 and all shared libraries versions have
  been bumped.  So you need to rebuild all applications that depend on
  gnutls. Do something like:

	portupgrade -rf gnutls

20080223:
  AFFECTS: users of www/instiki
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The default installation directory for instiki has changed from
  /usr/local/instiki to /usr/local/share/instiki.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your
  settings and data, please do the following:

	mv /usr/local/instiki /usr/local/share

  Then update as usual.

20080219:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xmonad
  AUTHOR: jacula@gmail.com

  From now XMonad uses a new configuration file system, so you don't have
  to edit Config.hs anymore.  Instead, create a custom configuration file
  ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs.  You can take a look at some samples on Xmonad's
  website.  Note that you can be interested in x11-wm/xmonad-contrib.

20080218:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/poco and devel/poco-ssl
  AUTHOR: lippemail@gmail.com

  The HashFunction class template has been changed in an incompatible way.
  The member function formerly named hash() is now the function call
  operator.  If you have defined your own HashFunction classes, then you
  have to update your code.

20080216:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/symon
  AUTHOR: uspoerlein@gmail.com

  The symon port has been updated from 2.75 to 2.78. It changes the wire
  protocol again. You should update your symux(8) and symon(8) installations
  simultaneously, as:

    - new symon clients will make old symux servers exit, and
    - new symux servers don't understand the old symon client's if() and
      mem() probes.

20080208:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  As was claimed in the entry 20070301 below in this file, you should fill
  ALT_DEPENDS section of pkgtools.conf for portupgrade to work correctly
  with your alternative dependencies.  Now it is an obligatory requirement.

  It was done as a compromise between speed and complexity.

20080203:
  AFFECTS: users of www/xshttpd
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  www/xshttpd now uses ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/ as a root directory for its
  data files.  The xshttpd configuration files have been moved to
  ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/conf/.  Please move the appropriate local files
  manually if you are upgrading from 3.4 or older versions.

20080202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/punbb
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  Install paths have changed. Please do the following prior to upgrade:

	cd /usr/local/www
	mv punbb punbb.old
	cp -R punbb.old/upload punbb

  It is now safe to update as usual.

  Notes:

  * You will probably get uninstall errors regarding files not found. It's
    safe to ignore them
  * Your webserver path has changed from www/punbb/upload to www/punbb,
    please adjust your webserver configuration and restart it
  * When you are satisfied with everything working properly you may remove
    the punbb.old directory:
	rm -r /usr/local/www/punbb.old

  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Deluge was updated to version 0.5.8.2.  If you are using blocklist plugin,
  you have to remove blocklist.conf first before you can run it, or it will
  crash upon start up.

	$ rm -f ~/.config/deluge/blocklist.conf

20080125:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security2
  AUTHOR: araujo@FreeBSD.org

  Update of mod_security2 is a dramatic change, because there is a need
  to completely rewrite their obsolete rules and migrate for capacity to
  use new syntax.

  You are advised to make a complete backup of your configuration files
  before you can perform an update.

20080118:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  FreeRADIUS 2.0 is now available as the net/freeradius2 port. All FreeRADIUS
  users are advised to consider upgrading to 2.0. It is the FreeRADIUS team's
  intention to put the 1.x server into 'maintenance' mode with just critical
  bug fixes.[1] 2.0 has many improvements including numerous bug fixes that
  were too difficult for the 1.x server, as well as many new features.

  Before uninstalling 1.x, it is recommended that you backup your
  configuration, which is typically in /usr/local/etc/raddb, then move it
  out of the way. It is also worth backing up the default configuration,
  which is typically in /usr/local/share/examples/freeradius/raddb.

  1.x configurations should work with the 2.0 server [2]. However the port
  automatically upgrades any unedited files in the configuration when you
  install a new version of FreeRADIUS. Installing 2.0 with the residue of a
  1.x configuration in the default location will result in a mixed 1.x and
  2.0 configuration that may not work.

  The recommended approach is to diff your 1.x configuration against the
  default 1.x configuration, then make corresponding changes to a copy
  of the default 2.0 configuration. If you moved your 1.x configuration out
  of the way before upgrading, you will have a 2.0 configuration ready to
  edit in the default location. It is worth reading man 5 unlang for details
  of the new FreeRADIUS 'un-language' before starting.

  Alternatively, you can move your 1.x configuration to another location,
  such as /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1, then edit /etc/rc.conf to point the rc.d
  script to that location. For example:

	radiusd_flags="-d /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1"

  I cannot guarantee that all 1.x configurations will work with the 2.0
  server, and I only recommend using a 1.x configuration as an interim
  measure.

  AFFECTS: users of irc/bitlbee
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  irc/bitlbee now stores saved user settings in /var/db/bitlbee/, not
  $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/.  You will have to manually move any existing user
  settings to the new location (or override the user settings directory
  using -d if you wish to keep the old behavior).  Other configuration
  files are still kept in $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/ by default.

  The default installation is now configured for running bitlbee as user
  'nobody' by default.  Make sure any existing configuration files are
  readable by that user.
