This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20231229:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/tarantool
  AUTHOR: arrowd@FreeBSD.org

  A new major version of the tarantool has been released.

  databases/tarantool renamed to databases/tarantool2.

  2.11 is an LTS version and will be supported for a while.

20231125:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php81
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 8.1 to 8.2.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info \*php81\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php81 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php82.

20231104:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.8 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20231031:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion-lts
  AUTHOR: michaelo@FreeBSD.org

  devel/subversion-lts has been updated from 1.10.x to the latest LTS version,
  1.14.x. Some changes between these releases may require attention from
  administrators or users.
  Refer to https://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.14.html#compat-misc for details.

20231028:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nfdump

  nfdump-1.7.x is compatible to nfdump-1.6.18, which means it can
  read files created with nfdump-1.6.18 or newer. Flow files created
  with earlier nfdump versions may not contain all flow elements.
  If you have older files, it is recommended to use nfdump-1.6.17
  to update the records.

  nfdump 1.7.x provides the same set of programs as 1.6.x and can
  be used almost as a drop-in replacement. This may change in future
  and older legacy programs may be removed. You can convert any old
  files from nfdump-1.6 to nfdump-1.7 format by reading/writing
  files: ./nfdump -r old-flowfile -y -w new-flowfile

  Please note, that only nfdump may read older flow files. All other
  programs relay on the new file format.

20231027:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  When updating to >= 23.10.0, a broken crontab is fixed. This breakage
  caused the validation error: Scheduler is not running
  After updating, If that error does not clear for you, run:

    sudo lnms config:cache

20231027:
  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript9*
  AUTHOR: michaelo@FreeBSD.org

  The default ghostscript version has been updated from 9 to 10.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 9 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ghostscript 9 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ghostscript=9

  Please note that print/ghostcript9* will be removed in the future since it is
  not supported by upstream anymore.

20231026:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/chicken
  AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  The chicken binaries csc and csi, together with their manual pages, have been
  renamed to chicken-csc and chicken-csi, to avoid conflicts with lang/mono.
  This is in line with what several Linux distros do. See PR 274736.

20231023:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailman3
  AUTHOR: einar@isnic.is

  logging.http section has now been split into two parts, logging.http is for
  the Mailman internal code and logging.gunicorn is for Gunicorn specifically
  since they have different logging formats. This should fix spurious errors
  with KeyError: t that was often confusing for users.

  Python 3.9 is now the minimum supported version of Python.

20231017:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.36.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.

20231014:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl and security/openssl30
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The openssl port was renamed to openssl111 and subsequently the
  openssl30 port was renamed to openssl.

  The shared library version of OpenSSL has been bumped.

  Users of DEFAULT_VERSIONS= ssl=openssl30 must update this to
  ssl=openssl.
  Users of DEFAULT_VERSIONS= ssl=openssl should not change this unless
  they use ports that require the deprecated OpenSSL 1.1.1 version.

  You must rebuild all ports that depend on OpenSSL if you use OpenSSL
  from ports.

20231011:
  AFFECTS: users of www/caddy
  AUTHOR:  adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The default admin endpoint has changed from localhost:2019 to
  /var/run/caddy/caddy.sock. Using a Unix socket is more secure,
  allowing it to be secured by filesystem permissions rather than
  requiring a firewall.

  If you only control caddy from the rc(8) script (service caddy ...),
  you don't need to do anything. If you access the API yourself, you
  will want to update your scripts to use the new socket.

  To use the old endpoint, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

    caddy_admin="localhost:2019"

20231009:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ntpd-rs
  AUTHOR: mikael@freebsd.org

  In 1.0.0 the configuration has been completely reworked, please check the
  documentation for details. Configuration will not automatically migrate.

20231004:
  AFFECTS: www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR:  mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Before you upgrade to version 16.4.x or higher, make sure you did the
  upgrade to 16.3.x!

  The database migration for 16.4.1 can fail due to unexpected name of a foreign key.
  So it is recommended to have a database backup available in case the solution
  described in the update manual does not work for you.

  The upgrade manual can be found as usual here:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/blob/master/update/16.3-16.4-freebsd.md


20230930:
  AFFECTS: users of Transmission (net-p2p/transmission@*)
  AUTHOR:  mondo.debater_0q@icloud.com

  Fixes Bug 274065 by reorganizing the port as a metaport
  (net-p2p/transmission) and components port (net-p2p/transmission-components).
  Each component may be installed through the flavors of
  transmission-componenents (@cli, @daemon, @docs, @gtk, @qt, @utils).
  Alternatively, one or more component may be installed by running make config
  on the metaport net-p2p/transmission.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/php-composer2
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The composer2 ports has been moved over the old devel/php-composer
  port, which was still providing the old EOLed version 1 of the
  software.

  Please use `pkg install php81-composer` (substitute 81 with the
  PHP version you're using) to properly upgrade.

20230924:
  AFFECTS: users of XFCE desktop (x11-wm/xfce4)
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  XFCE 4.18 is incompatible with the latest version of the adwaita
  icon theme (version 42.0 and newer), which was used as the default one.
  Due to this the default icon theme has been changed to
  x11-themes/xfce-icons-elementary.

  Users that have XFCE already installed and are using the adwaita
  icon theme will notice missing icons. To fix this you can install
  any other icon theme (like x11-themes/xfce-icons-elementary) and
  configure XFCE to use that via the "appearance" settings application,
  under the "icons" tab.

20230919:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission
  AUTHOR:  mondo.debater_0q@icloud.com

  The 4.0 port haphazardly consolidated prior slave ports into flavors of a single port.
  The flavors have now been revised to better match releases prior to 4.0.
  The -full flavor included in the 4.0 port has been replaced with -default, which
  restores the compile-time options of prior release's metaport. Other flavors allow
  for more piecemeal installs. The prior -web slave port can be installed through the
  -default flavor or the -daemon flavor.

  See Bug 273841 for more details.

20230915:
  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript10
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  The port flavors have been replaced with a default port option of X11.
  The flavors approach creates conflicting dependencies with other ports which
  cannot be solved this time with the ports framework.

  See PRs 270989 and 272541 for details.

20230910:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/powerdns
  AUTHOR: tremere@cainites.net

  In Authoritative Server 4.8, the LMDB backend gains a new Lightning
  Stream-compatible schema, which requires a data migration (this is
  automatic, and there is no migration back to the old schema). LMDB
  backend users should pay extra attention to the Upgrade Notes
  (https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/upgrading.html).

20230910:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Please make sure that the PostgreSQL server for the NetBox instance is
     running version 12 or higher.  This is because Django 4.2 requires
     PostgreSQL 12 as a minimum.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20230908:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 13 to 15.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 13, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql13-server postgresql13-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql13-server-13.12.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql13-contrib-13.12.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib databases/postgresql13-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql15-server databases/postgresql15-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql15-server databases/postgresql15-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql15-server databases/postgresql15-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data15 -U postgres"
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /var/db/postgres/data13/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data15/ -U postgres "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres" in 11. The migration steps above now assume
     the "postgres" database user and FreeBSD user.
  2) See the updating entry 20190829 if you are updating from a release prior to 11.
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20230906:
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/devcpu-data*

  The CPU microcode ports have been reorganized.  The new ports are:
  sysutils/cpu-microcode, sysutils/cpu-microcode-amd,
  sysutils/cpu-microcode-intel, and cpu-microcode-rc.

  To install all CPU microcode packages:

     pkg install cpu-microcode

  To install only packages for a specific CPU vendor:

     pkg install cpu-microcode-amd

     or

     pkg install cpu-microcode-intel

  To give users time to adjust to these changes, sysutils/devcpu-data will
  remain in the tree until the end of 2023.  The port has been converted to a
  metaport and now provides the same functionality as sysutils/cpu-microcode.

  Refer to the commit log in bc7829212d153aeff69b439d08e2e3001ef88ba3 for an
  explanation as to why these changes were made.

20230904:
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab

  The rc.d script of 4.0.2 had an error which didn't take the user to
  run openhab into account. After installing the update and stopping
  openhab run (for the default settings)
    chown -R openhab:openhab /var/db/openhab/userdata /var/log/openhab
  If you use other directories for the userdata and logs, you need to
  adapt accordingly.

20230822:
  AUTHOR: arrowd@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/polkit together with sysutils/consolekit2

  ConsoleKit2 has grown some logind1 compatibility which resulted in breaking
  changes in its API. One of its consumers, Polkit, is patched to handle it,
  so make sure to update both ports simultaneously.

20230822:
  AUTHOR: leres@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of security/zeek

  Zeek has been upgraded to 6.0.0 and the NETMAP option was removed;
  it was too difficult to build it without zeek being installed in
  %%PREFIX%%.

  The consensus was that this was a rarely used feature, please
  reach out to me if need this (I've done some work on a new
  security/zeek-netmap port that is probably the right way forward).

  When I upgraded zeek on my systems I found some cruft left over
  from previous versions. The way I recommend upgrading from 5.0.9 to
  6.0.0 is:

      service zeek stop
      pkg delete -fy zeek py311-zkg
      [clean up leftover files in /usr/local/lib/zeek]
      pkg install -y zeek
      service zeek deploy

20230817:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to 7.2. Users wanting to
  stay on 7.0 can replace databases/redis with databases/redis70 with
  one of the following commands.

  If you use pkg with binary packages:
    # pkg set -o databases/redis:databases/redis70
    # pkg upgrade
  If you use portmaster:
    # portmaster -o databases/redis70 databases/redis
  If you use portupgrade:
    # portupgrade -o databases/redis70 databases/redis

20230814:
  AFFECTS: usrs of www/kdsoap
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/kdsoap has been flavorized to support both Qt5 and Qt6.
  For symmetry, the Qt5 package has been renamed to kdsoap-qt5.

20230811:
  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-AnyEvent-WebSocket-Client
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  The update to AnyEvent-WebSocket-Client 0.55 introduce a change in behavior:
  close() default return code is now 1000 instead of 1005

20230730:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.34.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.

20230726:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The update to openhab 4.0.0 may require changes to the running 3.x setup.
  Read the release notes at
    https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/4.0.0
  and the blog entry at
    https://www.openhab.org/blog/2023-07-23-openhab-4-0-release.html
  for manual changes which are required before updating the port.

  After the update the pkg-message provides some more info about manual
  changes which are required to perform before the first start of 4.0.0.

  Note, this includes a switch from java 11 to java 17. You can deinstall
  openjdk11 afterwards, if it is not needed for something else.

20230723:
  AFFECTS: users of security/py-cryptography
  AUTHOR: tcberner@FreeBSD.org

  Modern py-cryptography uses rust. In order to still support the Tier-2
  architectures without rust support, a new default-version was added:
     PYCRYPTOGRAPHY
  it allows for the values 'rust' and 'legacy'.
  The default is 'rust' on all platforms supporting this.
  Note: users that are relying on the 'legacy' version will also take care
  of using a non-base OpenSSL in the future.

20230620:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/elixir-devel
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

	Note that Elixir now *requires* OTP25+ or better at runtime.
	For the -devel flavour you are still free to choose OTP25 or
	OTP26, but the default OTP24 from lang/erlang will *not* work.

20230618:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/soft-serve
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  soft-serve no longer uses config repository for configuration. To migrate
  configuration from 0.4.x to 0.5.x, please review the upgrade documentation at:

      https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/releases/tag/v0.5.0

  The migration process has been incorporated in rc.d script's migrate command,
  and can be performed using following instructions:

  0. Please make sure to backup repository data

  1. Stop existing process:

      # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/soft-serve stop

  2. Run the rc.d script to migrate, e.g.

      # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/soft-serve migrate
      INFO Setting SSH listen address...
      INFO Copying SSH host key...
      INFO Reading config repository...
      INFO Setting server settings...
      INFO Copying repos...
      INFO   Copying repo ports
      INFO   Copying readme from "config" to ".soft-serve"
      INFO Setting repos metadata & collabs...
      INFO Creating users & collabs...
      INFO Creating user "ashish"
      INFO Writing config...
      INFO Done!

  Another variable is introduced in rc.d script, soft_serve_data_path,
  indicating the path to data directory used by soft-serve.

20230618:
  AFFECTS: textproc/apache-solr*
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Apache solr is upgraded to version 9.
  Data migration is required, examples for dovecot data can be found here:
  https://dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2022-May/124701.html
  https://dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2022-May/124711.html

  If you like to stay on version8:
  # pkg delete apache-solr
  # pkg install apache-solr8

20230609:
  AFFECTS: users of security/sequoia
  AUTHOR: vishwin@FreeBSD.org

  sq has been split to security/sequoia-sq; security/sequoia becomes
  a meta-port, where security/sequoia-sq is currently the only
  dependency. As other programs are individually ported over, they
  will become OPTIONS in the meta-port.

  Per upstream, FFI is deprecated in favour of point solutions.

20230602:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. If the plugin security/py-netbox-secretstore is used, which is no
     longer maintained by upstream, the following steps must be done before
     upgrading to NetBox 3.5:

     * Migrate from security/py-netbox-secretstore (= 1.4.2_2) to
       security/py-netbox-secrets (= 1.7.6) with a NetBox 3.4.x instance.

       It is very important that the versions of py-netbox-secretstore and
       py-netbox-secrets match as specified otherwise the migration will not
       be successful.

       The reason for this is that py-netbox-secrets 1.8.x is not backwards
       compatible with Netbox 3.4.  For further details please see the
       updating instructions of py-netbox-secretstore or the UPDATING entry
       of 2023-05-11.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20230531:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netdisco
  AUTHOR: dgeo@centrale-marseille.fr

  The netdisco user now needs a HOME and a shell.
  For existing installs you will need to set
  HOME to /usr/local/etc/netdisco and shell to /bin/sh.

  For example in one shell line:
  pw user mod netdisco -d /usr/local/etc/netdisco -s /bin/sh

20230526:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  The port changes from USE_DB to USE_NDBM. Any existing configuration like
  ${lookup{$needle}dbm{haystack.db}}
  will need to change to
  ${lookup{$needle}dbm{haystack}}.

  Please also rename your old DBM files while the exim daemon is stopped:
  find /var/spool/exim/db/* -not -name \*.lockfile -exec mv -i {} {}.db \;

20230513:
  AFFECTS: users of www/tt-rss
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  www/tt-rss now expects the user to install the database drivers by hand
  allowing the port to be database independent however it would be best if you
  mark the php driver packages as a non-automatic package such that
  pkg-autoremove doesn't uninstall them.

  Change 80 to your corresponding php version (80, 81, 82)

  mysql: pkg set -yA 0 php80-mysqli php80-pdo_mysql;
  pgsql: pkg set -yA 0 php80-pgsql php80-pdo_pgsql;

20230511:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/py-netbox-secretstore
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream no longer maintains py-netbox-secretstore which it is not
  compatible with NetBox 3.5 or newer.  To ensure compatibility with newer
  releases of NetBox, the py-netbox-secrets plugin should be used instead.

  To migrate from security/py-netbox-secretstore to
  security/py-netbox-secrets please do following steps:

   1. Make a backup.

   2. Install security/py-netbox-secrets

   3. Enable both plugins by updating the following line in the netbox
      configuration (e.g. /usr/local/share/netbox/netbox/configuration.py):

      PLUGINS = ['netbox_secretstore', 'netbox_secrets']

   4. Run NetBox migrations:

      # cd /usr/local/share/netbox
      # python3.9 manage.py migrate

   5. Re-adjust the indices for the netbox-secrets plugin:

      # python3.9 manage.py sqlsequencereset netbox_secrets > output.sql

   6. Run the output of the previous command in the database, e.g.:

      # psql -d NETBOXDB < output.sql

   7. You can now remove netbox-secretstore from the application by removing
      it from the PLUGINS line in the netbox configuration:

      PLUGINS = ['netbox_secrets']

   8. Collect static files of the netbox-secrets plugin:

      # python3.9 manage.py collectstatic --no-input

   9. Restart WSGI/httpd environment (supervisord/apache/nginx/etc.).

  10. You may have clean up your database of the old tables manually, e.g.:

      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_secret;
      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_secretrole;
      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_sessionkey;
      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_userkey;

  11. Uninstall security/py-netbox-secretstore.

20230505:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  The patches included in the mail/mutt port will be removed in approximately a
  month making the port more inline with upstream. If you require any of these
  features most are available in mail/neomutt or it's possible to use
  EXTRA_PATCH_TREE to patch a port when building locally.

20230504:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/py-mqttwarn
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The redis option REISPUB has been renamed to REDISPUB
  You should update any make.conf setting etc which refer to this.
  e.g. change sysutils_py-mqttwarn_REISPUB to sysutils_py-mqttwarn_REDISPUB

20230416:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mongodb50, databases/mongodb44 and databases/mongodb60
  AUTHOR: ronald@FreeBSD.org

  MongoDB removed the settings 'fork' and 'pidFilePath' from the default

  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.6 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby30
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 3.0 to 3.1.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 3.0 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 3.0 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=3.0

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20230314:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl-devel
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  Users using DEFAULT_VERSIONS=ssl=openssl-devel must update their
  configuration to DEFAULT_VERSIONS=ssl=openssl30 or openssl31.

20230313:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/sqlite3
  AUTHOR: fuz@FreeBSD.org

  Due to various ports not being prepared for this change (see 20230227
  entry), the DQS option of databases/sqlite3 has been reenabled as a
  stop gap measure.  It is scheduled to be disabled again for good no
  earlier than 20240101, giving downstream software authors more time
  to fix their queries.

20230311:
  AFFECTS: users of net/dshell
  AUTHOR: nobutaka@FreeBSD.org

  net/dshell now depends on net/py-pcapy-ng instead of net/py-pcapy.
  Because net/py-pcapy-ng conflicts with net/py-pcapy, please uninstall
  py39-pcapy with the following command before upgrading:
  # pkg delete -f py39-pcapy

20230310:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/unifi7
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  The mongodb dependency has been changed from 36 to 44, as MongoDB 3.6
  is long out out support and end of life.

  The upgrade path should be as following:

  1. Take a backup from within the unifi7 application PRIOR to
     updating!

  2. Stop the unifi7 service (if running)

  3. Copy the "backup" directory from LOCALBASE/share/java/unifi/data
     to a safe location. Also copy keystore and system.properties if
     you have made any modifications to those files

  4. Remove files and directories under LOCALBASE/share/java/unifi/data

  5. Upgrade the package

  6. Copy the "backup" directory from a safe location back to
     LOCALBASE/share/java/unifi/data

  7. Start the service

  8. Restore the configuration from backup

  As an optional step, review system.properties and keystore to merge any
  manual modifications you have made (this has to be done with the application
  stopped)

20230310:
  AFFECTS: user of benchmarks/ddosify
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  keep-alive is removed from config file. In default mode, the engine will use
  keep-alive for all requests. If you want to disable keep-alive for a step, you
  can add Connection: close header to the step.

20230306:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.15.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20230304:
  AFFECTS: users of accessibility/atk and accessibilty/at-spi2-atk
  AUTHOR: tcberner@FreeBSD.org

  The packages accessibility/atk and accessibility/at-spi2-atk have been
  integrated upstream into at-spi2-core.

  Users of these packages can manually remove them prior to updating
  accessibility/at-spi2-core using

     pkg delete -f atk at-spi2-atk

  if the pkg update process fails due to conflicting files.

20230227:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/sqlite3
  AUTHOR: fuz@FreeBSD.org

  Option DQS is now disabled by default.  This option controls the "double
  quoted string literals are accepted" quirk, permitting the use of double
  quotes around string literals if enabled.  Users who rely on this quirk
  need to manually build databases/sqlite3 with the DQS option enabled.

20230227:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/py-spf-engine
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Default configuration file path of pyspf-milter has changed. Since
  it looks for ${PREFIX}/etc/etc/pyspf-milter/pyspf-milter.conf now,
  you should edit the file if you run pyspf-milter. Alternatively you
  can specify other configuration file path by setting
  pyspf_milter_conffile variable in /etc/rc.conf.

20230222:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Please make sure that the PostgreSQL server for the NetBox instance is
     running version 11 or higher.  This is because PostgreSQL 10 is
     End-of-Life since November 2022 and Django 4.1 requires PostgreSQL 11
     as a minimum.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20230218:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql57-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: joneum@FreeBSD.org

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.7 to 8.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.7 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.7 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql=5.7

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  # pkg set -o databases/mysql57-client:databases/mysql80-client
  # pkg set -o databases/mysql57-server:databases/mysql80-server
  # pkg upgrade

20230213:
  Affects: users of sysutils/nut*
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  The nut file ownership fixups due to the UID/GID change from uucp/uucp
  to nut/nut may not be desireable for all users. Some users with custom
  file ownership may wish ownership to remain untouched. This revision
  to the nut family of ports/packages allows users to optionally disable
  automatic fixup of nut file ownership.

20230213:
  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Since 1.4.1 ${PREFIX}/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles is empty and
  files to be checked by logcheck are specified in
  ${PREFIX}/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles.d/syslog.logfiles. So if
  you previously edited the former, then you should edit the latter
  now.

20230210:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  Fetchmail now warns about OpenSSL before 1.1.1s or 3.0.7, and rejects wolfSSL
  older than 5.5.1.

20230209:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/jack
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  audio/jack 1.9.22 fixes an issue with latency correction on FreeBSD.
  Latency correction parameters have to be measured again after update.

20230130:
  AFFECTS: users of USES=nodejs, www/node*, www/npm* and www/yarn*
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  The current USES=nodejs has the following issues:
  - www/node is not the default version while www/node16 is.
  - It also means inconsistent naming of node ports.
  - www/npm duplicates with www/npm-node16.
  - www/yarn duplicates with www/yarn-node16.

  The notable changes are introduced to fix the above issues:
  - Rewrite Mk/Uses/nodejs.mk.
  - Add new LTS version of nodejs (www/node18).
  - Add new current version of nodejs (www/node19).
  - Change default nodejs version from 16 to 18 (latest LTS),
  - Use consistent naming for all supported node versions.
  - Convert www/node, www/npm and www/yarn to meta ports.

  After these changes:
  - All supported node versions are named as node{14,16,18,19}.
  - www/node is a meta port which depends on the default version
    (e.g. www/node18)
  - www/npm is a meta port which depends on the default version
    (e.g. www/npm-node18)
  - www/yarn is a meta port which depends on the default version
    (e.g. www/yarn-node18)

20230129:
  AFFECTS: users of benchmarks/ddosify
  AUTHOR: fernape@freebsd.org

  In 0.13.0 some configuration keys have been renamed for consistency. Have a
  look at https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify/releases/tag/v0.13.0 for details.

20230127:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn
  AUTHOR: mandree@freebsd.org

  OpenVPN has been updated to the new upstream release v2.6.0, which
  is quite compatible with v2.5 versions.

  A copy of the latest v2.5.8 port is being kept as security/openvpn25 (or
  openvpn25 package) until end of March 2023.

20230116:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nut and sysutils/nut-devel
  AUTHOR: cy@freebsd.org

  As of PR/268960 Network UPS Tools will now run under its own UID and GID
  instead of uucp. Users who wish to continue using the uucp user and
  group may add NUT_USER=uucp and NUT_GROUP=uucp to their make.conf.

  After upgrading sysutils/nut or sysutils/nut-devel with this patch,
  restart devd. Then restart nut. This will fix up the permissions of
  UPS USB devices and allow nut to start normally.

20230111:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@freebsd.org

  Graylog 5.x and higher effectively constrains ElasticSearch
  dependencies, and in most cases will force a migration to
  OpenSearch 2.x, now available in ports. Plan accordingly.

20230104:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamassassin
  AUTHOR: cy@freebsd.org

  As of spamassassin 4.0.0 (3fdfceb36029) the deprecated HashCash plug-in
  was finally removed. Users using the HashCash plug-in will need to
  remove references to it.

20221226:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zrepl
  AUTHOR: driesm@FreeBSD.org

  The Prometheus metric zrepl_version_daemon has been converted to the
  zrepl_start_time metric. The metric still reports the zrepl verison in a
  label. But the metric value is now the Unix timestamp at the time the
  daemon was started. The Grafana dashboard in dist/grafana has been
  updated.

  The RPC protocol version has also been bumped; all zrepl daemons in a
  setup must be updated and restarted before replication can resume.

20221220:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/unbound_exporter
  AUTHOR: thomas@beingboiled.info

  The config defaults for the log file and certificates have been changed.
  See /usr/local/etc/rc.d/unbound_exporter for possible options and adjust
  your rc.conf accordingly.

20221215:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Many users report that after updating ClamAV to 1.0.0 clamd and
  freshclam fails to start with integrity check error of
  databases. According to the result of investigation it happens with
  following conditions.

  1. ClamAV is built on non-cleanroom environment (that is, neither
     FreeBSD official ClamAV package is used nor the package is built
     by user with poudriere).
  2. math/tomsfastmath is installed in the system that ClamAV is
     built.

  So if the errror happens on you system, uninstall TomsFastMath first
  and then rebuild and reinstall ClamAV. The problem should disappear.

20221128:
  AFFECTS: devel/py-proxmoxer
  AUTHOR: einar@isnic.is

  AuthenticationError Moved

  proxmoxer.backends.https.AuthenticationError was moved to
  proxmoxer.AuthenticationError (the class itself is the same).
  Any imports or references to proxmoxer.backends.https.AuthenticationError
  should be changed to proxmoxer.AuthenticationError.

  ProxmoxResourceBase Removed

  While this should be a fully internal change, the ProxmoxResourceBase
  class was removed. Use ProxmoxResource instead.

  Removed ProxmoxHTTPTicketAuth

  The auth_token and csrf_token arguments are no longer supported. If an
  existing (still valid) token needs to be used, you can pass the token
  as password and proxmoxer will attempt to renew the ticket and retrieve
  a new token and CSRF token.

20221126:
  AFFECTS: textproc/kibana8
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  kibana8 now installs kibana-specific utilities into LOCALBASE/bin as symbolic
  links.

  Please check whether it will overwrite your local files with names same as
  these utilities and if so, please rename them or move out of the way in a
  different manner.

20221126:
  AFFECTS: textproc/elasticsearch8
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  elasticsearch8 now installs elasticsearch-specific utilities into
  LOCALBASE/bin as symbolic links (i.e. elasticsearch-cli and similar).

  Please check whether it will overwrite your local files with names same
  as these utilities and if so, please rename them or move out of the way
  in a different manner.

20221126:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php80
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 8.0 to 8.1.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info \*php80\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php80 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php81.

20221123:
  AFFECTS: x11-wm/jwm
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  jwm 2.4 introduces changes in the configuration.  To convert an existing v2.3
  configuration file using xsltproc, run:

  cp ~/.jwmrc ~/.jwmrc.old
  xsltproc jwm-2.4.xslt ~/.jwmrc.old > ~/.jwmrc

  If you have multiple configuration files, it may be necessary to apply the
  XSLT to some or all of them depending on what configuration options are stored
  in the file.

  AFFECTS: textproc/apache-solr
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Apache solr version 9 is released and made available as extra port
  textproc/apache-solr9.
  Version 9 cannot start directly with data from version 8. Additional steps
  for data migration is required.
  If you like to use the new version, deinstall the old version and install
  the new version:
  # pkg delete apache-solr
  # pkg install apache-solr9
  After this you need to migrate data and migration, for this check the solr
  documentation.

20221015:
  AFFECTS: users of gstreamer1-* when upgrading via port builds on the host
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  The update of the gstreamer1-* ports to 1.20.3 requires a clean install of
  gstreamer1-* ports. In particular, when trying to update ports in-place using
  portupgrade or portmaster, the builds are likely to fail due to dependency
  mismatches. If this is your preferred update path, you need to deinstall
  (pkg delete -f) gstreamer1 and the plugins before reinstalling them from
  the ports tree.
  Note that pkg upgrade will do the right thing: If you use official FreeBSD
  packages or build your own set of packages using poudriere, nothing special
  is needed.

20221012:
  AFFECTS: devel/websvn
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  WebSVN 2.8.0 includes full PHP 8.x support which requires a change from PEAR
  to Composer 2. You must manually install dependencies through it, the ports
  system will not handle it anymore for you since */horde* (PR 266552) has been
  marked as incompatible with PHP 8.x for the time being. See pkg-message for
  detailed instructions.

20221011:
  AFFECTS: users of security/acme.sh
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  This update may break your install if you were using a symlink to
  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/acme.sh.conf - that file is no longer installed. Instead,
  a log rotation configuration is now installed to etc/cron.d/acme.sh.sample
  you should modify etc/cron.d/acme.sh to needs.

  The port now installs a log rotation file to etc/newsyslog.d/acme.sh.sample
  and you you should update etc/newsyslog.d/acme.sh to suit your needs.
  This file has long been part of the port, but was never installed.

  Neither the log rotation nor the crontab are active until you remove the
  comments.

20221002:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  Bash has been updated to version 5.2. In previous versions, the default port
  option-set used to link against libreadline from ports. However, the current
  version of devel/readline is too old for bash 5.2.

  For now, the default option has been switched to use the bundled version of
  libreadline and the other option is marked broken. Once devel/readline is
  updated this can be reverted.

  If you're updating bash from source and you've previously explicitly set to
  use use PORTS_READLINE, you'll have to disable the PORTS_READLINE option
  before updating:

  # cd /usr/ports/shells/bash
  # make config

   or flush it entirely:

  # cd /usr/ports/shells/bash
  # make rmconfig

20220903:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The Vim port no longer installs a system-wide vimrc. It drastically affected
  config loading order, and led to various settings being clobbered, duplicated,
  or ignored.

  Vim's provided defaults.vim (/usr/local/share/vim/vim90/defaults.vim) continues
  to be read just as before, but its settings are no longer clobbered. Take a look

  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  For more than a decade, the Elixir Mix tool and the Erlang rebar
  or erlang.mk build tools have been the de facto way of installing
  and managing packages for specific applications.

  All main-stream applications, from Riak, CouchDB, RabbitMQ, Phoenix,
  and Elixir, expect that packages are fetched and compiled into an OTP
  Release, with in-built version locking, external package management.

  There is no point in maintaining a large number of libraries, that

20220626:
  AFFECTS: users of python
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of python3 and python was switched to 3.9.

  For ports users wanting to keep version 3.8 as default,
  add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= python=3.8 python3=3.8 to make.conf

  Following procedures may ease the upgrade:

  For users of pre-build packages:
  # sh
  # for i in $(pkg query -g %n 'py38-*'); do pkg set -yn ${i}:py39-${i#py38-}; done
  # pkg upgrade

  For portmaster users:
  # sh
  # portmaster -o lang/python39 python38
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o "*py38*" | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f "*py38*"
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # REBUILD=$(pkg query -g "%n:%dn" '*' | grep py3 | grep -v py39 | cut -d : -f 1 | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD
  # REBUILD2=$(pkg list | grep python-38 | xargs pkg which | awk '{print $6}' | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD2

  Final steps (for pre-built packages & portmaster):

  If no longer required, Python 3.8 can be removed via
  "pkg remove python38" and the directory /usr/local/lib/python3.8 can
  then be deleted afterwards, if not empty.

20220625:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/fusefs-bindfs
  AUTHOR: doralitze@chaotikum.org

  Bindfs defaults to use direct I/O since version 1.16. While this results
  in major performance improvements as well as several bug fixes, this also
  breaks direct legacy calls to mmap. If your application still uses them
  consider these two options:

  1. Mount using `--no-direct-io`
  2. Upgrade your application in order to query mapping guards

20220623:
  AFFECTS: users of science/gramps
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  databases/py-bsddb3 is deprecated and will be removed in the future. With that
  gramps will lose the ability to load family trees using Berkeley DB.
  It is suggested to migrate all family trees using Berkeley DB by exporting
  them to gramps xml and import that gramps xml into a family tree using sqlite
  as database.

20220620:
  AFFECTS: users of www/selenium
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  The port has changed startup args so if you are using selenium_args= in
  rc.conf you need to add the parameter "standalone" manually.

20220616:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  The NetBox 3.2 release contains major changes, so at least items 1.), 2.)
  and 3.) must be checked before proceeding with the upgrade!

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  1. This release includes a database migration that will remove the "asn",
     "contact_name", "contact_phone", and "contact_email" fields from the
     site model.  (These fields have been superseded by the ASN and contact
     models introduced in NetBox v3.1.)

     To protect against the accidental destruction of data, the upgrade
     process will fail if any sites still have data in any of these fields.

     To bypass this safeguard, set the NETBOX_DELETE_LEGACY_DATA environment
     variable when running the upgrade script, which will permit the
     destruction of legacy data.

     A set of migration scripts is available to assist with the migration of
     legacy site data:

     https://github.com/netbox-community/migration-scripts

  2. NetBox v3.2 requires Python 3.8 or later.

  3. If the NetBox Plugin "net-mgmt/py-netbox-plugin-extension" is used,
     please disable it before the migrations are applied.  This can be done
     by removing the entry "netbox_plugin_extensions" from the "PLUGINS"
     section in the NetBox configuration.

     Once the upgrade is done, this port/package can be safely removed as
     it's no longer required.

  4. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20220608:
  AFFECTS: devel/autoconf-wrapper, devel/autoconf213
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  These ports have been renamed to devel/autoconf-switch and devel/autoconf2.13
  respectively.  If your favourite port updating tool cannot handle that then
  just remove the packages with "pkg delete" and then install the new port.

20220607:
  AFFECTS: security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH has been updated to 9.0p1 with incompatible changes.
  See https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.0 for details.

20220602:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  Graylog 4.3.0+ fails to start if graylog's internal collector for
  system statistics is enabled. This will eventually be addressed
  upstream.

  Add disable_native_system_stats_collector=true to your graylog.conf.

20220513:
  AFFECTS: devel/nexus2-oss
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  Nexus 2.15.x introduces incompatible configuration changes. You
  must review changes in ETCDIR/wrapper.conf and ETCDIR/jetty*.xml
  with updated samples as well as NEXUS_WORKDIR/conf/logback-nexus.xml
  with its origin from
  DATADIR/nexus/WEB-INF/lib/nexus-core-VERSION.jar!/META-INF/log/logback-nexus.xml,
  grant write access to files in ETCDIR since Nexus itself might
  update files in place otherwise your instance will not properly
  work after the update.

20220510
  AFFECTS: sysutils/zrepl
  AUTHOR: monwarez@gmail.com

  The zrepl update to 0.5.0.8 includes the following breaking changes:
  - The Prometheus metric zrepl_version_daemon was converted to zrepl_start_time
  The metric still reports the zrepl version in a label.
  But the metric *value* is now the Unix timestamp at the time the daemon was started.
  The Grafana dashboard in zrepl examples directory has been updated.

20220502:
  AFFECTS: mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  Default header cache option has been changed to the new option LMDB using
  databases/lmdb. The BDB option still exists but now uses databases/db18 due
  to the EOL of databases/db5.

20220501:
  AFFECTS: users of drm-current-kmod and drm-devel-kmod
  AUTHOR: manu@FreeBSD.org

  Both ports where removed.
  If you were using either one of them directly (i.e. without using
  graphics/drm-kmod metaport) use graphics/drm-510-kmod.
  If you have some problems with this one try drm-54-kmod and report
  a bug on https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod.

20220428:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to 7.0. Users wanting to
  stay on 6.2 can replace databases/redis with databases/redis62 with
  one of the following commands.

  If you use pkg with binary packages:
    # pkg set -o databases/redis:databases/redis62
    # pkg upgrade
  If you use portmaster:
    # portmaster -o databases/redis62 databases/redis
  If you use portupgrade:
    # portupgrade -o databases/redis62 databases/redis

20220426:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/grantleetheme
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The pkg update of deskutils/grantleetheme to 22.04 can fail due
  to a filesystem location having changed from being a file to being
  a directory. This leads to pkg's temporary file creation throwing
  an error.

  To update to KDE Gear 22.04 please run
  # pkg delete -f grantleetheme
  prior to the update.

20220424:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu has been updated to 7.0.0. Previous 6.2.X branch has
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu6. If someone wants to stick with 6.2.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install qemu6/qemu6-nox11(based on flavor used)
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu6 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu6 emulators/qemu

20220421:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby27
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.7 to 3.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.7 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.7 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.7

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20220413:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  AUTHOR: ports@skyforge.at

  Synapse will now refuse to start up if open registration is enabled,
  in order to help mitigate abuse across the federation. If you would
  like to provide registration to anyone, consider adding email,
  recaptcha or token-based verification in order to prevent automated
  registration from bad actors. This check can be disabled by setting
  the enable_registration_without_verification option in your
  homeserver configuration file to true. More details are available in
  the upgrade notes[0].

  Synapse will additionally now refuse to start when using PostgreSQL
  with a non-C values for COLLATE and CTYPE, unless the config flag
  allow_unsafe_locale, found in the database section of the
  configuration file, is set to true. See the upgrade notes[1] for
  details.

20220410:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/screen
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  As of sysutils/screen-4.9.0_5, the MULTUSER option is default, reverting
  to the traditional setuid-root behavior. People who wish to secure their
  screen install must terminate all screen sessions, then install screen
  without the MULTIUSER option. The option was reversed because it caused
  too much astonishment among users of screen.

20220401:
  AFFECTS: security/sshguard
  AUTHOR: kevinz5000@gmail.com

  Blacklisting is now disabled by default to avoid overriding the setting in
  sshguard.conf. To enable blacklisting, uncomment the BLACKLIST_FILE line in
  sshguard.conf.

20220329:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/screen
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  As of sysutils/screen-4.9.0_3, the multiuser feature is not supported
  by default. The multiuser feature requires setuid root to function.
  This creates a security risk. Some Linux distributions have had
  non-setuuid root screen for a dozen or more years. FreeBSD is following
  suit. A new MULTIUSER option has been added to enable users to install
  setuid root screen. The MULTIUSER option default is OFF.

  Users who wish to use the multiuser feature may,

  - Build screen using the MULTIUSER option, or
  - Poudriere users can use poudriere-options to enable the MULTIUSER
    option, or
  - Users can chmod the setuid bit for ${LOCALBASE}/bin/screen-4.9.0,
    making screen setuid root to enable the multiuser feature.

20220326:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/freebsd-doc-*
  AUTHOR: blackend@FreeBSD.org

  A change to the doc toolchain prevents the build of individual
  localized HTML versions of the documentation without building the
  en_US version.  HTML option is currently disabled until a good
  solution is found.  PDF version, the default option, is now the only
  available option.

  Please re-run "make config" to pick up this new default.

20220313:
  AFFECTS: users of net/unison
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  unison has been updated to version 2.52. The new version introduces
  a new wire protocol and on disk archive format. This new version
  is compatible with 2.51 clients for communication, so it's now
  possible to upgrade one side and then the other.

  The archive files are automatically converted to the new version,
  but once they are converted the y are incompatible with the
  previous version.

  In case you need version 2.51, the previous version of the port
  is preserved in net/unison251.

20220311:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/get_iplayer
  AUTHOR: jamie@catflap.org

  get_iplayer has a number of changes to quality settings that may
  break existing configurations. Please see the release notes for
  further information:

  https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/release320to329#release329

20220311:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  In order to comply to hier(7), VirtualBox's configuration of non-default
  IP ranges to be used in host-only mode moved from /etc/vbox/networks.conf
  to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/vbox/networks.conf.

20220311:
  AFFECTS: users of net/nats-server
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  A dedicated 'nats' user was added, replacing 'nobody' in the startup script.
  You should check your configuration and assign updated ownership to your data
  files.

20220227:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/bmeps
  AUTHOR: takefu@airport.fm

  The binary and man page have been renamed from bmpp{.1.gz} to bitmap2pp{.1.gz}

20220225:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/py-wxPython40
  AUTHOR: lbartoletti@FreeBSD.org

  x11-toolkits/py-wxPython40 has been removed to be replaced by the 4.1
  version.
  However the new wxPython ports is now named x11-toolkits/py-wxPython4.

  Depending on the tools you use, you may have to remove the port
  before ports upgrade.

20220224:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/openfire
  AUTHOR: nikita@druba.su

  The port version have been updated from 4.6.x to 4.7.x.
  It is recommended to do database and configs backup before updating.

20220219:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/intel-pcm-devel
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/intel-pcm-devel became quite obsolete once sysutils/intel-pcm is
  now pretty much following a constant and stable update cycle, so users of
  the -devel version are encouraged to switch to it.

  If you still have sysutils/intel-pcm-devel installed, please delete it from
  your system and install sysutils/intel-pcm instead:

  # pkg delete sysutils/intel-pcm-devel
  # pkg install sysutils/intel-pcm

20220219:
  AFFECTS: users of math/qhull*
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  Because of entries in MOVED, portupgrade can get confused updating qhull.
  It is recommended that you delete qhull and ports depending upon it, and
  then reinstalling all the dependent ports.

20220218:
  AFFECTS: users of TeX*
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  TeX system has been updated to 2021 from 2015. Normal pkg upgrade or
  portmaster -a should handle all the upgrade properly. In case not please
  create a ticket or send a mail to tex@FreeBSD.org

  print/tex-aleph has been removed as per upstream. This package should be
  removed manually. Additionally users have reported to delete
  texlive-texmf prior to starting update, or pkg-static will indicate
  there is a conflict during the upgrade of texlive-base :

  # pkg remove tex-aleph texlive-texmf

20220218:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The storage directory has moved from WWWDIR to /var/db/librenms/storage
  to comply with man 7 hier. When upgrading, you may need to manually create
  this symlink.

20220212:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php8[01][-extensions]?
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  Non-Default OPTION MYSQL80 has been removed in lieu of making
  php8[01]-openssl as part of DEFAULT php8[01] installation. Although
  for php74 it is not the case. Ports that depends on
  security/php8[01]-openssl will no longer be installed as these have
  been removed. There is no side effect of this for ports which have
  USE_PHP=openssl. In case for php74 as the default php74-openssl will
  be installed otherwise it will be used from php installation.

  If you are using pkg, you have to remove php8[01]-openssl manually after
  the upgrade :

  # pkg info \*php8\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  # pkg upgrade -y
  # pkg delete -f php8[01]-openssl
  # service -R

  While rebuilding from ports users old php.conf is not overwritten. So
  have to manually remove the ports. For portmaster users:
  # sh
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o "*php80*" | grep -v openssl | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f "*php80*"
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # portmaster -a

20220207:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  Amavis does now depend on archivers/7-zip (7zz) you might need to update
  your amavisd.conf and replace all ocurances of p7zip (7zr) accordingly.

20220129:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/neovim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Neovim now uses luajit-openresty as the Lua provider. Many neovim plugins
  compile some of their code (Packer does this, as do many LSP plugins).
  Neovim will produce errors and fail to load the plugins.

  Deleting and reinstalling any plugins that produce errors should fix the
  startup.

  If you use Packer, you also want to delete the startup cache:

  # rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/plugin/packer_compiled.lua

20220128:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/source-sans-ttf
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  The font name has changed its prefix from SourceSansPro* to SourceSans*.
  Users of this font might need to change their configurations to pick up
  the new names.

20220128:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/dendrite
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  The configuration needs to be updated to version 2 following upgrade to
  Dendrite v0.6. Please refer to /usr/local/etc/dendrite/dendrite.yaml.sample
  for a sample configuration.

20220127:
  AFFECTS: users of PyQt
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Most of the PyQt ports have been merged into single port devel/py-qt5-pyqt.
  `pkg upgrade` will handle update automatically .

20220126:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/bogofilter, mail/bogofilter-lmdb
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of mail/bogofilter now uses LMDB instead
  of Berkeley DB. It is not compatible and cannot read databases.

  Your options are:
  1. use bogoutil on each wordlist for each of your users first,
  ONLY THEN reinstall bogofilter, THEN reload the databases with bogoutil,
  OR
  2. install the matching bogofilter version and
  If you had been using bogofilter-lmdb so far, install bogofilter.
  If you had been using bogofilter so far, install bogofilter-bdb.

20220125:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php74
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.4 to 8.0.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info \*php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php74 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php80.

20220120:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/dwm
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  dwm has been updated to 6.3. The option RUGAPS is no longer available because
  it depends on a patch only available for version 6.2. RUGAPS can be
  reintroduced if desired once it is ported to 6.3 by the interested party.

20220118:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Please make sure that the PostgreSQL server for the NetBox instance is
     running version 10 or higher.  This is because PostgreSQL 9.6 is

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-utils
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  New port emulators/qemu@tools has been introduced which is similar to
  emulators/qemu-utils. qemu-utils has also been DEPRECATED in favor for
  this as it's MASTER port has also been marked DEPRECATED and set to
  expire on 2022-01-09. For updating to qemu-tools please use one of
  the following command:

  # pkg install qemu-tools
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu-utils emulators/qemu@tools

20211116:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu50
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu50 has been moved to emulators/qemu5 and updated to 5.2.0
  which is the last version from 5.X.X branch. This is done in preparation
  of updating emulators/qemu into latest 6.X branch. If someone wants to
  stick with 5.X.X branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install qemu5
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu50 emulators/qemu5

  This version also introduces a stripped nox11 version which can be
  installed with:
  # pkg install qemu5-nox11
   or
  # portmaster emulators/qemu5@nox11

20211115:
  AFFECTS: AFFECTS: users of *-emacs2x-* packages
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  To avoid problems when editors/emacs or editors/emacs-devel are
  updated, the emacs major version has been removed from these package
  names.

  For example, the old and new package names of devel/magit are

  -----------------------------------------------------------
  | Old Package Name          | New Package Name            |
  |-------------------------- |-----------------------------|
  | magit-emacs27             | magit                       |
  | magit-emacs27_nox         | magit-emacs_nox             |
  | magit-emacs27_canna       | magit-emacs_canna           |
  |                           |                             |
  | magit-emacs29_nox         | magit-emacs_devel_nox       |
  | magit-emacs29             | magit-emacs_devel           |
  -----------------------------------------------------------

  To handle these final package name changes, follow a similar procedure
  as the one described in the 20200811 entry.  That is, simply running
  `pkg upgrade` will not upgrade, e.g., foo-emacs27_nox to
  foo-emacs_nox.

  Binary package users:

  To update these packages, run these commands under /bin/sh with superuser
  privileges before upgrading.

  # default flavor of editors/emacs installed
  for i in $(pkg query -g %n '*-emacs27'); do
    if [ "$i" != "notmuch-emacs27" ]; then
      nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/-emacs27//')
    else

  AFFECTS: users of www/node*, www/npm*, www/yarn*
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The port framework was updated to use a default version for nodejs.
  The default version is pointing to the latest LTS version which is
  currently version 16.
  You can overwrite this by defining in /etc/make.conf, e.g. version 17:
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS=nodejs=17

  Or if you would like to stick always to the current version use:
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS=nodejs=current

  If you would like to use yarn or npm together with nodejs version 17,
  just install the package that is pulling the wanted dependency to nodejs:

  # pkg install yarn-node17
  # pkg install npm-node17

20211109:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.4 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20211107:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/devcpu-data
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  The RC variable name microcode_cpus is now deprecated.  Users should
  instead use the variable microcode_update_cpus.

  Two new ports were branched from sysutils/devcpu-data,
  sysustils/devcpu-data-amd and sysustils/devcpu-data-intel.  The two
  new ports contain only the CPU microcode updates for each vendor and
  sysutils/devcpu-data now only contains an RC script.  Both new ports
  are on-by-default, optional dependencies of sysutils/devcpu-data.

20211101:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/redisearch
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/redisearch port has been updated to the recent stable
  release - v2.2.  Users wanting to stay on v2.0 can replace
  textproc/redisearch with textproc/redisearch20 with one of the
  following commands:

  # pkg install textproc/redisearch20
    or
  # portmaster -o textproc/redisearch20 textproc/redisearch
    or
  # portupgrade -o textproc/redisearch20 textproc/redisearch

  NOTE: The textproc/redisearch20 brings a new name for the module,
  i.e. redisearch20.so, so be careful.

20211024:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/beats7
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  The following breaking changes apply to beats 7.15.0 and newer:

    - All beats:
    Loading Kibana assets (dashboards, index templates) rely on Saved Object API.
    So to provide a reliable service, Beats can only import and export dashboards
    using at least Kibana 7.15.

    - Filebeat:
      - Remove all alias fields pointing to ECS fields from modules. This affects
        the Suricata and Traefik modules.
      - Fix Crowdstrike ingest pipeline that was creating flattened process fields.
      - Rename log.path to log.file.path in filestream to be consistent with log
        input and ECS.

    - Heartbeat:
      - Remove long deprecated watch_poll functionality.
      - Fix inconsistency in event.dataset values between heartbeat and fleet by
        always setting this value to the monitor type / fleet dataset.

    - Metricbeat:
      - Fix Elasticsearch jvm.gc.collectors.old being exposed as young

20211024:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 12 to 13.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 12.8, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql12-server postgresql12-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql12-server-12.8.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql12-contrib-12.8.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib databases/postgresql12-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data13 -U postgres"
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /var/db/postgres/data12/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data13/ -U postgres "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres" in 11. The migration steps above now assume
     the "postgres" database user and FreeBSD user.
  2) See the updating entry 20190829 if you are updating from a release prior to 11.
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20211023:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v17.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node16, has been created for the
  upcoming v16.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v16.x can replace
  www/node with www/node16 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node16
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node16 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node16 www/node

20211012:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  devel/git port was split into multiple sub-ports that depend on devel/git
  and install additional files:

  - devel/git-cvs - CVS related scripts and man pages
  - devel/git-gui - GUI related scripts and man pages
  - devel/git-p4  - Perforce related scripts and man pages
  - devel/git-svn - Subversion related scripts and man pages

  Due to these changes, CVS, GUI, PERFORCE, and SUBVERSION options
  as well as gui and svn flavors were removed from the port.

20211010:
  AFFECTS: users of gtk2 flavored devel/geany*
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream dropped support for gtk2. Due to this the ports are now
  unflavored, installing only with gtk3 support.

  If you are already using the default gtk3 flavor will get the new
  version with a simple "pkg upgrade".

  To upgrade when using the gtk2 flavors you need to use "pkg install"
  to install the new unflavored gtk3 packages, pkg will automatically
  uninstall the old gtk2 flavors.

  If using ports, you will need to uninstall all geany packages and
  its plugins and reinstall from an updated ports tree.

  The "geany-plugin-multiterm" plugin was only available as a gtk2
  flavor when installing the gtk2 flavor of geany and has not been
  ported to gtk3, so has been removed from the tree, so the
  geany-plugin-multiterm-gtk2 package should be removed from the system.

20211007:
  AFFECTS: user of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream changed end-of-life policy and introduced long time support
  (LTS) feature release.

  * LTS feature release will be identified approximately every two
    years and supported for at least three years from the initial
    publication date of that LTS feature version.
  * Regular (non-LTS) feature releases will be supported for at least
    four months from the initial publication date of the next feature
    release or until the feature release after that is published.

  According to it new port security/clamav-lts is added for users who
  want to use LTS version of ClamAV.

  Users wanting to switch to LTS version can replace security/clamav
  with security/clamav-lts with one of following commands.

  If you use pkg with binary packages:
    # pkg set -o security/clamav:security/clamav-lts
    # pkg upgrade
  If you use portmaster:
    # portmaster -o security/clamav-lts security/clamav
  If you use portupgrade:
    # portupgrade -o security/clamav-lts security/clamav

20211006:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/freebsd-doc-*
  AUTHOR: blackend@FreeBSD.org

The misc/freebsd-doc-* ports have been updated to the new doc toolchain,
and use a somewhat different arrangement of directories and symlinks,
which pkg 1.17 does not handle well.

Users are encouraged to delete the misc/freebsd-doc-* ports, then
reinstall the new ones without using the pkg upgrade facility.

20211006:
  AFFECTS: users of net/kafkacat
  AUTHOR: sergey@akhmatov.ru

  kafkacat has been renamed to kcat upstream.
  So switch to net/kcat instead.

20211004:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  The NetBox 3.0 release contains major changes, so at least items 1.), 2.)
  and 3.) must be checked before proceeding with the upgrade!

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  1. Please ensure that your local installation of net-mgmt/netbox is at
     the 2.11 release before attempting to upgrade to NetBox 3.0 or later.

  2. Please also note that the previously deprecated secrets functionality
     has been removed with NetBox 3.0.  This means, all of the secrets still
     remain in the database once upgraded, only the secrets functionality on
     the part of NetBox is no longer given.

     In order to continue to be able to access the stored secrets as usual
     (and then possibly migrate them to another solution, e.g.
     security/vault), please install the security/py-netbox-secretstore port
     once NetBox has been upgraded to 3.x and follow its installation
     instructions how to enable the plugin.

  3. If plugins are used, they should be temporarily deactivated to avoid
     disruptions during the upgrade process.

  4. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20211004:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-pyjwt
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@FreeBSD.org

  To make it possible to easily import py-pyjwt v2.x the current port was
  moved to a versioned directory.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -o www/py-pyjwt1 www/py-pyjwt
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fo www/py-pyjwt1 www/py-pyjwt
  If you use pkg with binary packages:
        pkg set -o www/py-pyjwt:www/py-pyjwt1

  AFFECTS: x11-wm/cage, x11-wm/hikari, x11-wm/labwc, x11-wm/sway, x11-wm/wayfire
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  SUID option has been removed in favor of seatd-launch(1) which doesn't
  require special handling in every consumer and doesn't bypass group
  permissions. If you've already enabled seatd service or use consolekit2
  then nothing changes. Otherwise,

    $ sway
    00:00:00.001 [ERROR] [wlr] [libseat] [libseat/libseat.c:83] No backend was able to open a seat
    00:00:00.001 [ERROR] [wlr] [backend/session/session.c:84] Unable to create seat: Function not implemented

    00:00:00.001 [ERROR] [sway/server.c:53] Unable to create backend

  can be fixed by

    $ ck-launch-session sway

  or

    $ seatd-launch sway

  or

    # sysrc seatd_enable=YES
    # service seatd start
    $ sway

  Replace "sway" with your compositor e.g., "cage", "hikari", "labwc", "wayfire".

20210907:
  AFFECTS: consumers of math/eigen[23]
  AUTHOR: adridg@FreeBSD.org

  math/eigen2 has been marked deprecated. There do not seem to be any
  consumers in FreeBSD ports.

  math/eigen3 has had its options re-vamped. The default options previously
  pulled in multiple useless library dependencies. The options also forced
  a specific BLAS implementation. The new options depend only on the
  default BLAS (whatever USES=blaslapack picks), but this can be turned
  off. The previous multiple useless libraries -- which are not useless
  when running the tests in Eigen -- are now hidden behind the default-off
  TEST option.

  Users of a carefully-tuned Eigen build should re-evaluate the options
  available.

20210902:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The vim ports have been completely reworked to take advantage of flavors.

  The biggest change is that the `vim' package is now console-only. If
  you want the GTk3 GUI, you'll need to install the `vim-gtk3' package
  instead. All the GUI toolkits have their own package now: vim-gtk3,
  vim-gtk2, -athena, -motif, and -x11. The vim-tiny package still exists.

  Also: only python3 bindings are included now. There are very few plugins
  written in Perl or Ruby, so there really wasn't a need to bundle those
  languages with Vim. They still exist as OPTIONS, so you can still enable
  them if you'd like. Also, support for py27 has been dropped.

20210901:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/ampache
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  With the upgrade to Ampache 5.0.0, the root Ampache folder has changed
  to %%WWWDIR%%/ampache/public.  Please update your web server aliases,
  for example if you use Apache, then in httpd.conf make sure the lines
  look like this:

  Alias /ampache /usr/local/www/ampache/public

  <Directory "/usr/local/www/ampache/public">

  If you have customised your .htaccess files to allow for a different
  alias, you'll need to move them to the new location after upgrading:

  # sh -c 'cd /usr/local/www/ampache && for f in */.htaccess; do mv $f public/$f; done'

  More upgrade notes can be found on Github:

  https://github.com/ampache/ampache/releases/tag/5.0.0

20210823:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mu
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mu now uses XDG Base Directory Specification for the default
  locations for various files.  The mu database now lives under
  ~/.cache/mu rather than ~/.mu by default.  After upgrading,
  move the contents under ~/.mu to ~/.cache/mu.

20210823:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfixadmin
  AUTHOR: ports.maintainer@evilphi.com

  The 3.2->3.3 upgrade requires generating a new setup password hash.

20210818:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  databases/redis6 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install databases/redis6
    or
  # portmaster -o databases/redis6 databases/redis
    or
  # portupgrade -o databases/redis6 databases/redis

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/beats7
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  Beats may not be sending data to some distributions of Elasticsearch

  In this release, Elastic is enabling a licensing change that was broadly
  communicated earlier in 2021. This change would imply that 7.13 instances of
  Beats would fail to connect to 7.10 or earlier open source distributions of
  Elasticsearch and Kibana.

  The most visible effect is that sysutils/beats7 users can expect
  difficulties to send data to Elastic instances hosted in AWS.

  Changing "*." to "." should make your bindings work again.

20210704:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/qtchooser
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  QtChooser allows you to select your version of Qt among those installed.
  However, this tool is no longer supported upstream and will not be
  available for Qt6.

  By default, our Qt installations are done in:
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/qt${QT_VERSION} as recommended.
  We have added symbolic linking for the main binaries to
  ${LOCALBASE}/bin with the suffix -qt5.

20210620:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab2
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The openhab v3 port has been committed. Upstream has removed the
  version from the name, as such the FreeBSD port follows in all places
  (start script name, directory names, ...).
  Users are encouraged to migrate from misc/openhab2 to misc/openhab.

  No automatic config migration is available Both versions can be
  installed in parallel, but an users has to take care to not run
  both at the same time on the same port.

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/mesa-libs and x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  Some libraries from mesa-libs are now provided by libglvnd while
  others were renamed. nvidia-driver already used libglvnd but bundled
  a copy which is now provided as a separate package. When building
  outside poudriere make sure to remove mesa-libs and nvidia-driver
  first in order to avoid conflict with libglvnd.

  typical items needs to be changed - file bug reports in that case,
  preferably with tested patches:

  - The IlmBase parts Imath and half are now repackaged as Imath
  - The IlmThread and Iex libraries are now part of OpenEXR
  - Some header files were rearranged accordingly, into
    ${LOCALBASE}/include/OpenEXR vs. ${LOCALBASE}/include/Imath
  - Some code needs a few #include statements added, often
    #include <ImfHeader.h> or #include <ImfFrameBuffer.h>
  - Some classes were removed, and the C++11 standard library
    features need to be used, f. i. std::numeric_limits.
  - Some code used Int64 or SInt64 should use uint64_t or int64_t.

  Detailed porting hints are available here:

  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/oldschool-pc-fonts
  AUTHOR: evgeniy@khramtsov.org

  x11-fonts/oldschool-pc-fonts has been upgraded to 2.2. This version
  changed names of many fonts. If you have configuration files with
  specific font names set, you need to update your configurations
  after upgrade.

20210406:
  AFFECTS: users of www/phpvirtualbox
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  www/phpvirtualbox has been updated to version 6.1. This new version
  only supports version 6.1 of VirtualBox.

  Version 5.x of phpvirtualbox has been preserved as
  www/phpvirtualbox-legacy. If you require support for VirtualBox
  5.x please install this version. Remember to copy your configuration
  file in the new legacy installation.

20210328:
  AFFECTS: users of www/caddy
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The default locations for caddy runtime files have changed.

  - Caddy's runtime log is now /var/log/caddy/caddy.log
    (was /var/log/caddy.log)

  - Automatic SSL certs are now stored in /var/db/caddy/data/caddy
    (was /root/.local/share/caddy)

  - Configuration autosaves are now stored in /var/db/caddy/config/caddy
    (was /root/.config/caddy)

  You can change these defaults. See /usr/local/etc/rc.d/caddy for the
  list of settings.

20210322:
  AFFECTS: users of net/wireguard
  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  A wireguard kernel implementation supporting FreeBSD 12.1 and newer was
  added as net/wireguard-kmod recently.

  The new default for users of net/wireguard is the kernel module.

  If you experience problems with it you can switch back to wireguard-go
  by removing net/wireguard-kmod and making sure net/wireguard-go is
  installed.
  The userland tools wg-quick(8) and wg(8) try to use kernel support if
  the kernel module is available and otherwise fall back to wireguard-go
  automatically. Config files are fully compatible.

20210317:
  AFFECTS: users of security/strongswan
  AUTHOR: driesm@FreeBSD.org

  The stroke starter interface has been deprecated by upstream
  for some time now.  The default interface for controlling the charon
  daemon has switched from stroke to vici. Users still using the
  legacy config files such as ipsec.conf and ipsec.secret (stroke, starter)
  can easily revert to the old behavior by:

  # sysrc strongswan_interface="stroke"

  It is recommended to use the vici interface which is configured by swanctl.conf.
  Check : https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Fromipsecconf
  to ease the transition from ipsec.* to swanctl.conf

20210313:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/phpipam
  AUTHOR: marko.cupac@mimar.rs

  ipaddresses table in phpipam database is likely to contain incorrect datetime
  values which prevent successful upgrade.  Make sure to create backup of
  phpipam database.  Before starting upgrade wizard in web interface run the
  following SQL query on phpipam database:

    UPDATE ipaddresses SET lastSeen='1970-01-01 00:00:01' WHERE lastSeen < '0000-01-01 00:00:00';

20210310:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/redisearch
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/redisearch port has been updated to the recent stable
  release - v2.0.  Users wanting to stay on v1.6 can replace
  textproc/redisearch with textproc/redisearch16 with one of the
  following commands:

  # pkg install textproc/redisearch16
    or
  # portmaster -o textproc/redisearch16 textproc/redisearch
    or
  # portupgrade -o textproc/redisearch16 textproc/redisearch

  NOTE: The textproc/redisearch16 brings a new name for the module,
  i.e. redisearch16.so, so be careful.

20210309:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/virtualbox-ose has been updated to 6.1.18. This new
  version only works on amd64 hardware.

  Previous version 5.x of the virtualbox ports have been preserved
  as emulators/virtualbox-ose-legacy and similarly named ports for
  the other parts.

  If you can't run the latest version or wish to stay with the old
  version, please install the legacy ports.

  Also the additions at present build successfully only for amd64.
  If you need i386 additions you can fallback to the old legacy
  ones.

  NOTE: There is no support for moving saved running machine states
  across major updates of virtualbox. It is recommended to properly
  shutdown all virtual machines before upgrading. Otherwise the saved
  state can simply be discarded after the upgrade, if it's not
  important to preserve it.

  It should also be possible to downgrade to the legacy ports and
  shutdown the machine properly from the saved state and then upgrade
  back again.

20210302:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs-devel
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  If you get the error "Symbol's value as variable is void: minor-modes",
  rebuild the offending Emacs packages.  See
  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2021-02/msg01164.html
  for details.

20210220:
  AFFECTS: users of math/py-mathics
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  math/py-mathics has been split into several ports, and Mathics Core
  only provides a rudimentary command-line shell called mathics.
  To get the same functionality as in 1.x, you need to install either
  mathicsscript or Mathics-Django.

  AFFECTS: users of games/mangband
  AUTHOR: adridg@FreeBSD.org

  The client has updated from 1.1.3 (which has a single public server
  left) to the current 1.5.3 (which has more public servers). If you
  update, you can NOT connect to the old server any more. Remember
  to finish your game before updating.

20210208:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailscanner
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  The clamavmodule has finally been removed after a long deprecation
  period.  Please remove all references to it in your mailscanner.conf as
  it will now count as a syntax error and may stop MailScanner starting!

20210204:
  AFFECTS: users of www/unit
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for NGINX Unit's state directory has changed.  It
  was moved from /usr/local/libexec/unit to /var/db/unit in order to
  avoid write operations on /usr/local filesystem.

20210130:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opencv-core
  AUTHOR: tcberner@FreeBSD.org

  graphics/opencv-core has been reintegrated into graphics/opencv.
  So there is no longer a circular dependency
     opencv-core -> ffmpeg -> opencv

  If you experience problems updating the packages, try
      pkg delete -f opencv-core

20210124:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  The Django templating language (DTL) is no longer supported for export
  templates.  Please ensure that all export templates use Jinja2 before
  upgrading.

  Also the support for embedded graphs was completely removed and several
  changes to the REST API were made.  Please check the changelogs for
  further details.

20210114:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/matterircd
  AUTHOR: norrland@nullbyte.se

  Commandline switches

  Switched to viper for cmdline parsing, which does not support "short" flags.
  You'll need to use --flag instead of -flag. Eg ./matterircd --debug
  Bridge specific configuration is now only in configuration file. This means
  the following flags have been removed: -restrict,-mmteam,-mmserver,
  -mminsecure,-mmskiptlsverify.
  You can set those in matterircd.toml, see the example file.

  Config changes

  BlacklistUser feature for slack has been renamed to DenyUsers.
  JoinMpImOnTalk feature has been renamed to JoinDM and is available for
  slack/mattermost
  JoinInclude, JoinExclude now support regexp (see matterircd.toml.example)
