This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: Users of audio/clementine-player
  AUTHOR: sbruno@FreeBSD.org

  The audio/clementine-player port has been updated to v1.3.1, the latest
  upstream release.  The music database code now has a hard dependency on
  databases/sqlite having the FTS3_TOKENIZER option enabled.  This has 
  been made the default option in databases/sqlite.

  Without this option, clementine-player will crash on startup.

20160510:
  AFFECTS: Users of biology/seqan
  AUTHOR: junovitch@FreeBSD.org

  The biology/seqan port has been split into biology/seqan (only the
  library) and biology/seqan-apps for the programs based on SeqAn. Both
  ports are based on version 2.1.1 of the SeqAn repository. There is a new
  biology/seqan1 port with version 1.3 of SeqAn for backwards compatibility,
  but this port will likely be deprecated in the next year so please update
  your software to SeqAn2.

20160505:
  AFFECTS: Users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bradleythughes@fastmail.fm

  The www/node port has been updated to node.js v6.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. Users of node.js v5.x are encouraged to upgrade as
  soon as possible, as upstream support will end two months from now.

  The www/node5 port has been created to aid users transition. Use one of
  the following commands to continue using node.js v5.x:

  # pkg install node5
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node5 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node5 www/node

20160503:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  LibreSSL 2.3 has removed SSLv3 support completely which leads to issues
  with a number of ports. Patches for many of these issues can be found
  on https://wiki.freebsd.org/OpenSSL/No-SSLv3

  After upgrading to 2.3.4, manually update all packages that depend on
  any of the libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and
  libtls) since the versions of these libraries have changed. Normally,
  you can obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20160501:
  AFFECTS: Users of mail/dspam
  AUTHOR: junovitch@FreeBSD.org

  dspam has been modified to no longer run as root:mail by default.
  Existing configuration must be adjusted to reflect using a non-privileged
  port and the /var/run/dspam directory for PID and socket files.  If you
  need dspam to run as root for your mail setup, you can use the SETUID
  config option to enable the old insecure behavior.

20160229:
  AFFECTS: users of www/nginx and www/nginx-devel
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The ${MODULESDIR}, default directory for dynamic modules, has been
  changed from ${ETCDIR}/modules to ${PREFIX}/libexec/${PORTNAME}.
  It's highly recommended to review existing configuration files of
  nginx, i.e. ${PREFIX}/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.

20160424:
  AFFECTS: Users of net-mgmt/icinga2
  AUTHOR: lme@FreeBSD.org

  The creation of Icinga2 directories and files in /var is now controlled 
  by the /etc/rc.conf variable icinga2_mkvar.  Earlier ports always 
  created the /var entries, but could slow startup significantly when /var 
  was a normal disk rather than a RAM disk.  icinga2_mkvar defaults to 
  "NO".

20160415:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/chromaprint
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  chromaprint has been updated to version 1.3.1 and includes a shared
  library bump. PORTREVISIONS have been bumped on affected ports.
  If you are using binary pkg, 'pkg upgrade' will do the right thing.
  Users of portmaster/portupgrade must rebuild all ports which depend
  on chromaprint.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -w -r chromaprint
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr audio/chromaprint

20160414:
  AFFECTS: Users of www/tt-rss
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  Tiny Tiny RSS can use a database running on a separate server.
  Previously, in this case, you had to set the option DBLOCAL; this option
  has been removed and replaced by a settable run-time flag: now you
  should set
  ttrssd_local_db="NO"
  in your /etc/rc.conf .

20160414:
  AFFECTS: Users of graphics/kipi-plugin-googledrive and graphics/kipi-plugin-picasaweb
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  DigiKam and its related ports have been updated to 4.14.0, the latest
  stable upstream release.

  The graphics/kipi-plugin-googledrive and graphics/kipi-plugin-picasaweb
  have both been merged into the new graphics/kipi-plugin-googleservices
  following a move done upstream.

  Those two ports must be removed, and graphics/kipi-plugin-googleservices
  should be used instead.

20160413:
  AFFECTS: All users of www/node-devel
  AUTHOR: bradleythughes@fastmail.fm

  www/node-devel was outdated and has been removed. Upstream no longer
  releases a development version. You can use the www/node port to get
  node.js 5.x by running one of the following commands:

  # pkg install node
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node www/node-devel
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node www/node-devel

20160413:
  AFFECTS: multimedia/x264
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  LSMASH replaced GPAC by default. If you use BATCH=y in /etc/make.conf
  and hit below error make sure to re-run "make config".

  ====> You cannot select multiple options from the MP4 radio
  *** Error code 1

20160412:
  AFFECTS: Users of net/samba42 and net/samba/43
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba 4.2.x and 4.3.x ports have been updated to address
  BadLock(http://badlock.org) vulnerability, as well as few other
  discovered.

  Please note that Samba 4.1.x and older versions are also affected by 
  the issues fixed with this release but are not supported anymore. It is
  strongly recommend to upgrade to a recent version at your earliest 
  convenience.

  The security updates include new smb.conf options and a number of
  stricter behaviours to prevent Man in the Middle attacks. Between these
  changes, compatibility with a large number of older software versions
  has been lost in the default configuration.

  For more information about the related behaviour changes and the
  security issues please visit:

20160411:
  AFFECTS: Users if databases/influxdb
  AUTHOR: cheffo@freebsd-bg.org

  To upgrade to InfluxDB 0.12, you must be on version 0.10 and all shards must
  be in TSM format (the default storage engine starting with InfluxDB 0.10).
  See the 0.10 documentation [1] for how to convert b1 and bz1 shards to TSM. If
  any b1 or bz1 shards are present, InfluxDB 0.12 will not start.

  Next, you need to update your metastore *before updating to 0.12.* [2]

  AFFECTS: All users of www/pecl-http
  AUTHOR: bofh

  www/pecl-http has been updated to the latest 3.x stable release, which 
  supports php70+ and a new port www/pecl-http2 has been created for the
  2.x branch.

  Should users want to continue to use version 2.x, replace www/pecl-http with
  www/pecl-http2 as follows:

  Using packages:

    # pkg delete pecl-http
    # pkg install pecl-http2

  Using ports:

    # portupgrade -o www/pecl-http2 www/pecl-http

  OR

    # portmaster -o www/pecl-http2 www/pecl-http

20160404:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby21
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.1 to 2.2.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.1 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.1 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.1

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby22 lang/ruby21
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.2

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby21:lang/ruby22
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.2.\* -fr lang/ruby22

20160404:
  AFFECTS: mail/spamassassin
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Support for SSLv3 has been removed from SpamAssassin, because
  SSLv3 is a Bad Idea. No direct option is provided to re-enable it.
  If your setup requires use of SSLv3, some instructions are available
  in FreeBSD PR 208225.

20160331:
  AFFECTS: security/clamav-unofficial-sigs
  AUTHOR: lukasz@wasikowski.net, sf@maxempire.com

  This version of clamav-unofficial-sigs is eXtremeSHOK's fork.
  Configuration file location has changed from
  %PREFIX%/clamav-unofficial-sigs.conf to
  %PREFIX%/clamav-unofficial-sigs/

  master.conf and os.conf hold default values, local changes should
  be placed in user.conf.

20160324:
  AFFECTS: print/ghostscript9-base
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The default Ghostscript port has changed from print/ghostscript9-base,
  which is no longer developed, to print/ghostscript9-agpl-base.  Package
  users will upgrade automatically.  Ports users can stick with the old
  port by adding "DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ghostscript=9" to /etc/make.conf, or
  move to the new port with:

      portmaster -o print/ghostscript9-agpl-base ghostscript9-base
  or: portupgrade -o print/ghostscript9-agpl-base print/ghostscript9-base

  And if you have ghostscript9-x11 installed:

      portmaster -o print/ghostscript9-agpl-x11 ghostscript9-x11
  or: portupgrade -o print/ghostscript9-agpl-x11 print/ghostscript9-x11

  Note that print/ghostscript9-agpl-base is licensed under the AGPLv3
  while print/ghostscript9-base is licensed under the GPLv3.

20160317:
  AFFECTS: security/openvas-client
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenVAS ports have been updated from version 2 to version 8.  All
  components have been renamed and rearranged.  The old OpenVAS client
  no longer exists.  Instead there is a web interface provided by
  security/greenbone-security-assistant or a command-line interface
  provided by security/openvas-cli.

20160311:
  AFFECTS: print/hplip
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  HPLIP has been updated to verion 3.16.2.  As part of the update support
  for the hpijs/foomatic-rip filter has been dropped.  This has long been
  unsupported upstream.  If you used this filter with your printer you'll
  have to remove the printer with HP Device Manager and then add it back as
  a new device.

20160311:
  AFFECTS: print/cups-base, print/cups-client, print/cups-image
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  The cups-base, cups-client and cups-image packages have been combined
  into one cups package.

  If you build your own ports the easiest way to update is to delete these
  packages first and then build and install print/cups.

  If you are using binary packages, depending on the packages installed on
  your system, pkg(8)'s solver might get confused. In this case do not proceed
  with the upgrade but delete first the packages:

  pkg delete -fg "cups*"

  Then usual upgrade process: pkg upgrade

  The device URI of USB printers has changed so you have to adjust the
  printer configuration.  Go to http://localhost:631/printers/.  Click on
  your printer and select "Modify Printer" in the Administration drop-down.
  You should then be able to select the new URI of the printer.  The web
  interface requires cookies and JavaScript to function properly so make
  sure your browser does not block them.

  The package also installs a devd(8) configuration file now that gives
  cups access to USB printers.  Unless you have any special needs you can
  remove any devd(8), devfs.conf(5) or devfs.rules(5) configuration related
  to cups that you may have added in the past.

20160306:
  AFFECTS: net-mgmt/yaf

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfixadmin
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  Caveat when updating to version 2.93: If you have an existing
  configuration and are NOT using the recommended practice of putting your
  settings changes in config.local.php:

  Copy config.inc.php to config.local.php prior to upgrading, then revise
  config.local.php for the current version afterward.

  Postfixadmin will not function correctly unless correct and complete
  data structures are placed in config.inc.php. Therefore the file must be
  upgraded as part of the package and any changes to config.inc.php will
  be overwritten.

  Detailed information regarding this procedure is provided in step 3 of

  Varnish has been updated to 4.1.0. As part of the update an effort has
  been made to increase the security of the varnish daemons by utilizing
  separate UIDs. Users who upgrade will likely run into a permissions
  issue as a result. The simplest solution is to delete files varnish
  will recreate with the correct permissions and to adjust permissions
  of existing log files.

  The following changes will allow you to start varnishd, varnishlog,
  and varnishncsa successfully:

  # rm -r /usr/local/varnish/$(hostname)
  # rm /var/run/varnishlog.pid
  # rm /var/run/varnishncsa.pid
  # chown varnishlog /var/log/varnish.log
  # chown varnishlog /var/log/varnishncsa.log

  Please also note that the syntax for binding to additional IPs has
  changed in 4.1.0. Multiple listening addresses are now specified by
  using multiple -a arguments. In rc.conf it would look like this:

  varnishd_listen="x.x.x.x:80 -a y.y.y.y:80"

  The subversion upgdate to 1.9 branch introduces new "old" subversion
  port devel/subversion18.

  If you don't want to update your subversion installation, run

        pkg set -n subversion:subversion18

  AFFECTS: users of security/sshguard-ipfw
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  The sshguard update to 1.6.2 introduces a rewritten IPFW backend. The
  previous approach was to insert individual block rules with a
  predefined  numbered range. This does not scale well and is not
  flexible so the design was scrapped. The new approach utilizes IPFW
  tables. The sshguard IPFW backend now inserts offenders into hardcoded
  table 22.

  To continue blocking the attackers effectively you will need to add a
  block rule like the following:

  ipfw add deny all from 'table(22)' to any

  AUTHOR: sbruno@FreeBSD.org

  The Jemalloc update at svn r286871 introduced some TLS enhancements
  for MIPS targets that require a bit of workaround.  Users who want
  to build MIPS packages should update their host systems past r286871
  prior to upgrading their qemu-user-static/qemu-sbruno ports.

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/ffmpeg
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  ffmpeg has been updated to the version 2.8.
  If you are using binary pkg, 'pkg upgrade' will do the right thing.
  Users of portmaster/portupgrade must rebuild all ports which depend
  on ffmpeg.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -w -r ffmpeg
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr multimedia/ffmpeg

20150916:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/jpeg
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  Default implementation of jpeg has been switched from graphics/jpeg to
  graphics/jpeg-turbo.  To perform the upgrade, use instructions below.

  If using binary packages: 'pkg upgrade' will do the right thing.  If it
  doesn't and complains about 'Cannot solve problem using SAT solver', run
  'pkg delete -f jpeg' before 'pkg upgrade'.

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o graphics/jpeg-turbo jpeg

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -f -o graphics/jpeg-turbo graphics/jpeg

  If you compile your ports and want to keep using IJG's jpeg implementation,
  add this line to your /etc/make.conf file:
  JPEG_PORT=graphics/jpeg

20150914:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Binary package users can ignore this.

  The way lang/perl5* ports install themselves has changed.  From now on, only
  the default Perl port (currently 5.20), or the version listed in
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS, will install /usr/local/bin/perl.

  If you are NOT using the default version of Perl (as of right now, it is
  5.20) you MUST add a line setting the version you are using to your
  /etc/make.conf, to preserve /usr/local/bin/perl:

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=	perl5=5.xx

  If your Perl package name is not called perl5-5.xx.y but perl5.xx-5.xx.y,
  you will need to rename it so that portupgrade and portmaster do not get
  confused:

    pkg set -n perl5.xx:perl5

  After this date, to migrate from one Perl version to the other, you must
  first put the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line in your make.conf, and then, for example,
  if you want to move from 5.20 to 5.22, do:

	pkg set -o lang/perl5.20:lang/perl5.22
	portmaster `pkg shlib -qR libperl.so.5.20`

  If you do not do that, you will replace your default Perl 5.20 installation
  (one that has /usr/local/bin/perl) with an installation that does not have
  /usr/local/bin/perl, and it will break everything.

20150908:
  AFFECTS: users of print/texlive-base
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  pdfclose and pdfopen utilities in print/texlive-base are now in a separate
  port print/xpdfopen.  While upgrading print/texlive-base, a conflict may
  occur between pdfclose utility installed by an old print/texlive-base and
  one being installed by print/xpdfopen.  If it occurred on your system,
  remove the installed print/texlive-base first by using the following
  command:

   # pkg delete -f texlive-base

20150901:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/libreoffice
  AUTHOR: jkim@FreeBSD.org

  editors/libreoffice has been updated to 5.0.1.  However, FreeBSD 9.x is
  no longer supported because it requires C++11-capable library installed
  in the base.  If you cannot upgrade your system or still want 4.3.x for
  some reason, use editors/libreoffice4.

20150822:
  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/ghostscript{7,8,9,9-agpl} have been split into
  print/ghostscript{7,8,9,9-agpl}-{base,x11}.
  print/ghostscript*-nox11 ports have been removed.

  The -base installs Ghostscript binaries, libgs, and other data files
  and it depends on no X11 library.  The -x11 installs a small shared
  library to enable x11* devices in the installed -base package.

  In most cases, Ghostscript is installed as a dependency.  A port/package
  which requires Ghostscript will automatically pick up -base, and
  when x11* devices required it will pick up -x11 in addition.

  If one wants to install Ghostscript manually and full compatibility
  with the previous versions, just install -x11 because it installs
  -base as a dependency.  Combination of the two provides the same
  functionality as before.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  7.10.2 and Haskell Platform has been removed.  As a result, it is
  recommended to rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports and the
  lang/ghc port itself in one of the following ways:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  In case of pkg(8), it is probably safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.  For
  example:

  # pkg query "%ro" ghc > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc

  In ghc-pkgs.txt, check and remove all the packages that have been moved,
  then:

  # pkg install -y `cat ghc-pkgs.txt`

  s6-notifywhenup has been removed as of v2.2.0.0. Any run scripts
  using readyness notification must be updated to use a notification
  fd instead.

  s6-svc options have changed for sending syncronous up/down timeouts.
  Any management or wrapper scripts using those options will need to
  be updated.

  "Readyness notification support" in s6-supervise.html.

20150812:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/icinga and net-mgmt/icinga2
  AUTHOR: lme@FreeBSD.org

  The Icinga port has been split into two ports: net-mgmt/icinga-core
  which contains the Icinga 1.x backend and net-mgmt/icinga-classicweb
  which contains the Icinga classic web (CGI) interface. The latter can
  be both used with Icinga 1.x and the Icinga 2 port (net-mgmt/icinga2).
  A new meta-port net-mgmt/icinga was added which depends on both new
  ports, so updating the Icinga port should be transparent.

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/moosefs-master and other moosefs packages
  AUTHOR: feld@FreeBSD.org

  MooseFS ports have been updated to 2.0.72-1. Upstream has been
  providing a private package repository to distribute newer releases of
  MooseFS. These changes have now made it into the ports tree. This has
  resulted in splitting up the sysutils/moosefs-master port into several
  new ports:

  sysutils/moosefs-cli
  sysutils/moosefs-cgi
  sysutils/moosefs-cgiserv
  sysutils/moosefs-metalogger

  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, assuming you are
  migrating from 5.18 to 5.20, do:

  Portupgrade users:
	portupgrade -o lang/perl5.20 -f lang/perl5.18

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.20 lang/perl5.18

	portmaster -f `pkg shlib -R libperl.so.5.18|tail +2`

  NOTE:
    Perl has been removed from base more than ten years ago, so it was way past
    time for the /usr/bin/perl symlink to be removed from the port.  If for
    some strange reason, you still need it, you will have to create it
    manually.

  IMPORTANT:
    In case you have not updated your system in a while, and specifically,
    followed the 20141126 instructions regarding the new Perl layout, you

  On first launch, the rc script will move the /usr/local/etc/namedb directory
  into the chroot, and create a symlink to it.

  Note that, if you're running from within a jail, you need to have a
  /var/named/dev devfs created beforehand, with the null and random devices.

  AFFECTS: Users of net/asterisk* and net/pjsip ports
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Due to conflicts between base OpenSSL and ports provided OpenSSL
  library, which is required by net/libsrtp, the srtp support has
  to be removed from the default asterisk13 port configuration,
  otherwise a not working binary would be generated.

  To get SRTP support working in the asterisk ports make sure all
  dependencies are linked against the same SSL library implementation
  to avoid runtime conflicts. On 10.1 everything will work fine
  unless ports SSL libraries are explicitly installed. On older OS
  versions(10.0 and earlier) you will need to compile all ports
  with WITH_OPENSSL_PORT=yes.

  To get working SRTP support in asterisk13 with the pjsip backend
  it is also needed to enable the EXTSRTP option in the pjsip port.

  If the CURL option is enabled also make sure the ftp/curl port
  is using a GSSAPI implementation linking to the same SSL
  implementation the other ports are using (BASE or NONE if you're
  using base OpenSSL, GSSAPI_HEIMDAL GSSAPI_MIT otherwise). If an
  incompatible option is being used the curl module will cause
  asterisk to fail on startup due to mixing calls to OpenSSL from
  base and from ports.

  AFFECTS: Users of security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  The port now uses VersionAddendum for the port version string. Setting
  the value to "none" in your sshd_config and restarting openssh will allow
  removing the version from the banner.

  share/fonts

  The Xorg servers now are looking there by default

  If you experience font related issues, view the output of

20150304:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@highsecure.ru

  After upgrading of libressl you should manually update all packages that
  depending on this library since its version has been changed. Normally,
  you could obtain the list of dependent software by running the following
  command:

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20150301:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby20
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.0 to 2.1.

  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.0 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.0

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade -f

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby21 lang/ruby20
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.1

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby20:lang/ruby21
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.1.\* -fr lang/ruby21

  program to access the daemon or the GUI, install net-p2p/bitcoin-utils
  to reinstall them.

20150220:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP

  The default PHP version has been updated from 5.4 to 5.6.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages

  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  MYSQL, PGSQL, LDAP, and REDIS options are removed from port, as
  they're moved upstream to a separate project, which is yet to
  release snapshots. If you need those options, then please install
  "mail/opensmtpd" port instead. To do that:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o mail/opensmtpd mail/opensmtpd-devel

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o mail/opensmtpd mail/opensmtpd-devel

20150206:
  AFFECTS: users of net/serviio
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The java dependency changed from java 7 (java/openjdk7 if you haven't
  installed another java 7 implementation) to java 8 (e.g. java/openjdk8).
  If serviio is the only reason that java 7 is installed, you can delete
  java 7 after the update to serviio 1.5.0.

  The Java Polling Watch Service used in Serviio 1.5 aggressively searches
  for file system updates. Until the Serviio poller is re-enabled in 1.5.1,

  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.5 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql= 5.5

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

20150118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/thttpd
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  thttpd was updated to version 2.26, which brings several user-noticeable
  changes to the port:

    - Default WWW root was changed from ${PREFIX}/www/data to more expected
      (and standard) ${WWWDIR} (${PREFIX}/www/thttpd), be sure to check and
      adjust your thttpd configuration file and/or web layout accordingly;
    - Default CGI pattern was changed to "/cgi-bin/*"; this goes better in
      line with default installation;
    - Default data MIME type was changed to "application/octet-stream";
    - thttpd's own htpasswd(1) program, which was previously installed as
      thttpdpasswd(1) to avoid conflict with other webservers, is now being
      renamed to thtpasswd(1); this not just makes it shorter, but is more
      consistent with popular GNU/Linux distributions;
    - Index pages for directories are not generated by default from now on
      for security reasons; an option (INDEXES) is provided to turn them
      back on if they are wanted;
    - IPREAL option (to respect (pass on) "X-Forwarded-For" header) is now
      turned on by default: it is often required when thttpd is used as a
      CGI server behind nginx (http://wiki.nginx.org/ThttpdCGI).

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.48, which uses a different wire
  protocol than 2.40 did.  In order to support synchronization with
  other computers where Unison is still at version 2.40, a new port
  net/unison240 has been created.  It provides unison240 and if that is
  GTK2-enabled, also unison240-text.  This unison240 port can be
  installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

  The X.Org server (x11-servers/xorg-server) is updated to 1.14. All
  ports which provide X.Org drivers must be updated simultaneously, i.e.
  x11-drivers/xf86-*, emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions, net/tigervnc,
  etc.

  The input device autodetection backend is switched from HAL to devd.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl now links all .so it builds with libperl.so, it makes upgrading from one
  Perl major version to another way easier.  For binary package users, it means
  pkg upgrade will detect the libperl.so.x.yy change, and reinstall the
  affected packages.  For users using ports, it will save rebuild time as it's
  easier to detect what ports really need to be rebuilt.

  Ports users are encouraged to rebuild ports that install files in SITE_ARCH.
  If using Perl 5.18, run:

  With portupgrade:

    portupgrade -f `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

  With portmaster:

    portmaster `find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/mach/5.18 -name '*.so'|xargs pkg which -qo|sort -u`

  AFFECTS: users of TeXLive
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Several scripts in print/texlive-base have been moved to
  devel/tex-kpathsea.  Upgrading them can fail because texlive-base
  depends on tex-kpathsea, and the new tex-kpathsea tries to install
  files which were installed by the old texlive-base.  The following
  error message indicates this situation:

    pkg-static: tex-kpathsea-6.2.0_1 conflicts with texlive-base-20140525_3 (installs files into the same place).  Problematic file: /usr/local/bin/kpsewhere

  To solve this problem, remove both of tex-kpathsea and texlive-base first
  and install the new versions:

	# pkg delete -f tex-kpathsea texlive-base

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  The CentOS ports infrastructure has replaced Fedora 10 as default.

  1. Please delete all remaining f10 ports/packages:

     # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*

  2. Persistently update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:

     compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18

    This step is necessary on all FreeBSD versions, apart from 11.0-CURRENT
    (after revision 271982).

  3. Reinstall all software depending on Linux emulation.
     As an example, reinstall linux-firefox:

     # portmaster -r linux-firefox
       or
     # portupgrade -f www/linux-firefox
       or
     # pkg install linux-firefox

  If difficulties are encountered, please follow the UPDATING entry 20140922
  but skip step 2 (OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT and OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS
  in /etc/make.conf). In case these steps do not fix the issues, please submit
  an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing
  list.

  Users who need to continue using Fedora 10 base and userland should do the
  following instead:

  1. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:

      OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f10
      OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f10

  2. Downgrade the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf on FreeBSD versions
     newer than and including 11.0-CURRENT (after revision 271982).

       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16

  This is all that is needed to continue using an existing Fedora 10 Linux base
  and userland.

  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  With the recent split of multimedia/x264 in library and binary and library
  components, if an application that uses libx264 is updated before x264 itself,
  multimedia/libx264 will conflict with the existing x264 package. Delete
  this package before continuing any update that depends on it:

  depend on libx264, such as ffmpeg.

20141126:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The directories where Perl modules are installed has changed.  All
  affected ports' PORTREVISION have been bumped, so upgrading should
  be as painless as possible.  The old directories have been kept in
  the default Perl @INC to make it even more painless.

  The default Perl has been switched to lang/perl5.18.  These examples
  are for switching from lang/perl5.16, if you are running a different
  version, replace lang/perl5.16 with the origin of the Perl you have
  installed.

  Binary package users:

    # pkg upgrade -f

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
        pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.18):
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.18 -f lang/perl5.16

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
        portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.18

  Portmaster users:
        portmaster -o lang/perl5.18 lang/perl5.16

        Conservative:
        portmaster p5-

        Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
        portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: If the "perl5-" glob matches more than one port you will need to specify
        the name of the installed Perl package explicitly.  You can get its name

  AUTHOR: gblach@FreeBSD.org

  Enlightenment has been updated to 0.19.1. Some of e-modules can't be build
  with updated Enlightenment, these modules has been marked as broken.
  E-modules which work with new Enlightenment has been renamed to
  x11-wm/e-module-*. To update these modules you must call the following
  commands (substituting the name of module in place *):

  # portmaster -o x11-wm/e-module-* x11-wm/e17-module-*
  # portmaster -o x11-wm/e-modules x11-wm/e17-modules

  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The header and library files have been moved from PREFIX/{include,lib} to
  PREFIX/{include,lib}/heimdal at r373047 to fix a library dependency
  confusion when software attempts to link a Heimdal library in base and
  an external library in LOCALBASE/lib at the same time.

  All of packages which depend on security/heimdal have to be recompiled
  and reinstalled because of this library location change.

  AFFECTS: users of x11/gnome2, graphics/clutter and lang/vala
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME 3.14 was imported. Because this is a big change some manual help is
  needed. Please use the following instructions to update.

  Make a list of the installed ports:
  # pkg info > ~/installed-ports-list

  Delete the old and conflicting packages:
  # pkg delete clutter gnome-utils gnome-panel gnome-keyring vala-vapigen \
      guile gcalctool gnome-media libgnomekbd gnome-themes at-spi
  # pkg delete gnome-screensaver gnome-applets bug-buddy \
      evolution-exchange evolution-webcal gnome-system-tools \
      seahorse-plugins gnome-control-center

  For package users the following lines will be enough:
  # pkg upgrade
  # pkg install gnome3

  For ports users should do the following:
  # portmaster -a
  # portmaster x11/gnome3

  After these steps, check with the list we made earlier if your favorite
  ports are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

	# pkg delete -f kde-runtime-4\*

20141008:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby19
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 1.9 to 2.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 1.9 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 1.9 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=1.9

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby20 lang/ruby19
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.0

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby ruby-iconv portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby19:lang/ruby20
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.0.\* -fr lang/ruby20

  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Due to the way pkg works please note that the configuration
  variables MAILDROP_SUID and MAILDROP_SGID, despite keeping their
  old names, are now required to contain a valid username and
  groupname existing on the system in which the package will be
  installed, while in the past numeric uids and gids worked fine.

  Wrong values will cause pkg to skip installing the setuid binaries
  on the system.

  Please check your configuration.

  AFFECTS: users of comms/usbmuxd
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  libusbmuxd.so was split from comms/usbmuxd into comms/libusbmuxd.
  Remove usbmuxd before upgrading to avoid conflicts:

  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/calibre
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The dependency on graphics/py-imaging in calibre has been changed
  to using the graphics/py-pillow port.

  Due to this change automatic updating of the port will not work
  correctly.

  It is suggested to remove calibre and py-imaging from the system
  and then reinstall calibre again using binary packages or ports.

  AFFECTS: users of net/foreman-proxy
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  In version 1.6 Foreman Smart Proxy splits its configuration into multiple
  ruby files located in PREFIX/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d.
  The configuration of each service (dhcp, dhs, bmc, etc.) has been moved
  into a dedicated file.

  You can use a bundled script to convert your old settings to new settings:
  PREFIX/share/foreman/extra/migrate_settings.rb

20140926:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Bash supports a feature of exporting functions in the environment with
  export -f.  Running bash with exported functions in the environment will
  then import those functions into the environment of the script being ran.
  This resulted in security issues CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169, commonly
  known as "shellshock".  It also can result in poorly written scripts being
  tricked into running arbitrary commands.

  To fully mitigate against this sort of attack we have applied a non-upstream
  patch to disable this functionality by default.  You can execute bash
  with --import-functions to allow it to import functions from the
  environment.  The default can also be changed in the port by selecting the
  IMPORTFUNCTIONS option.

20140926:
  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk and net/asterisk11
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The asterisk ports have been modified to have the LUA option
  turned on by default to make such functionality available to users
  of binary packages.

  Some care should be taken before upgrading by people not using Lua
  to avoid the sample extensions.lua file from being loaded on reload
  after updating the asterisk port/pkg.

  Users compiling from ports not interested in LUA support are advised
  to disable the option before updating.

  People using binary packages(or not wanting to disable the LUA
  option in the port) not using the Lua functionality should add:

	noload => pbx_lua.so

  to the PREFIX/etc/asterisk/modules.conf file, if using the
  autoload=yes option in that same file. People not autoloading
  modules don't need to perform any special action.

  If asterisk is rebooted and the pbx_lua module gets loaded on a
  system were it should not, it will load the example extensions.lua
  configuration file adding unexpected logic to your dialplan. In
  such a case following the above steps and reloading asterisk will
  fix the problem.

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-f10 and emulators/linux_base-c6
  AUTHOR: xmj@FreeBSD.org

  The complete drop-in replacement linux-c6 port infrastructure is in
  ports and will shortly replace the current linux-f10- ports as default.

  To switch to the linux-c6 infrastructure:

  0. Back up all your vital information!
  1. Remove the current linux base port and all linux-f10- ports:
       # pkg delete -f linux_base-f10 linux-f10-\*
  2. Add these lines to /etc/make.conf:
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=c6
       OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=c6
  3. Make sure no Linux application is running.
  4. Update the Linux kernel version in /etc/sysctl.conf:
       compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
     Make it take effect immediately:
       # sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18
  5. Install emulators/linux-c6.

  These steps are usually sufficient. If there are difficulties, expand
  step 1 to:

  1a. Remove all ports which depend on the linux base port.
  1b. Remove the linux base port.
  1c. Clean the /compat/linux/ directory.

  If there are any other difficulties not fixed by these extended steps,
  please submit an issue report in Bugzilla and send an email to
  FreeBSD's emulation@ mailing list.

  AFFECTS: users seeing build errors about missing *.la files
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  We are in the process of adjusting or, if possible, removing libtool archives
  (*.la files) from all ports because they can otherwise cause overlinking
  between packages.  This is the problem where in the dependency chain A->B->C
  an extra link is added from A to C even if A does not use C directly.  This
  makes some updates to port C expensive because then both A and B have to be
  rebuilt instead of just B.

  This is mostly behind the scenes work that you won't notice.  In fact most
  ports have already been converted.  You may however run into build errors
  about missing *.la files if a port update in the past went wrong and left
  behind *.la files with references to other *.la files that are no longer
  there.  In this case, please run the following command:

  find /usr/local/lib -name '*.la' | xargs grep -l 'libfoo\.la' | xargs pkg which
  (Replace libfoo\.la with the *.la file that is missing.)

  This command will print a list of *.la files that refer to the missing *.la
  file and what package they belong to.  First, where it says "not found in
  the database", remove the *.la file.  After removing all such files, where
  it says "installed by package X", rebuild X.  Eventually the list printed by
  that command will be empty and the build error should be gone.

  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/pkg, ports-mgmt/pkg-devel
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Pkg has been updated to 1.3.7. This fixes registration and tracking of
  shared libraries. All earlier versions of Pkg incorrectly marked some
  shared libraries and used the wrong name for some.

  Please note announcement for special instructions at:
    http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports-announce/2014-August/000086.html

  - Users need to run 'pkg update -f' and 'pkg check -Ba' after upgrading to
    pkg-1.3.7 and before updating any other packages. This avoids needing to
    reinstall anything not needed due to changed shlibs.
     For binary package users:
      # pkg install ports-mgmt/pkg
      # pkg update -f
      # pkg check -Ba
      # pkg upgrade
     For port users:
      # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg build deinstall install clean
      # pkg check -Ba
  - People building packages for serving to other systems need to rebuild
    all packages with 1.3.7.

  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  libjpeg-turbo installs its own unique library (libturbojpeg.so) and
  a drop-in replacement for libjpeg.so. The drop-in replacement has been
  split off into graphics/jpeg-turbo; libjpeg-turbo now installs only
  libturbojpeg.so.

  If you were using the libjpeg.so from graphics/libjpeg-turbo, you
  should install graphics/jpeg-turbo AFTER upgrading the libjpeg-turbo
  port.

  AFFECTS: users of TeXLive
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  TeXLive in Ports Collection has been updated to TL2014.

  When upgrading print/texlive-base on a system which has
  TL2012 packages, the following error may occur:

  pkg-static: texlive-base-20140525 conflicts with texlive-texmf-20120701_4

  Please remove texlive-texmf-20120701_4 first in that case.

  If you still get a similar "conflict of install files" error,
  please remove all of tex-* and texlive-* packages and then
  see if ${PREFIX}/share/texmf-dist directory are empty.  If not,
  installing TeXlive can fail.  Removing files in the directory
  manually will fix the installation problem.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4, databases/db4[1-7]*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  HEADS UP: for some applications that store their data in Berkeley DB
  databases, you may have to export the data before the upgrade and
  reload it afterwards.  Detailed instructions are at
  <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

  The older databases/db4* ports providing versions 4.0 to 4.7
  inclusively have been removed, and 4.8 has been deprecated.
  The default Berkeley DB version is now 5.3.
  (6.x has a different license, but will be eligible as default on
  systems that build ports from source and have db6 installed.)
    All enabled and working ports have been changed such that they use
  Berkeley DB 4.8 or newer, and an -exp run has been made.

  After you have performed the first steps from the Wiki documentation,
  and have arrived at a step that reads "build all applications", then
  type as privileged user and without the hash sign:

  # Tools/scripts/BDB-upgrade-helper.sh

  The helper script requires that ports-mgmt/portmaster or
  .../portupgrade is installed, will try to upgrade your applications
  with either of these tools (portmaster preferred), and if that succeeds,
  it will attempt to delete the packages if confirmed interactively.

20140815:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/ilmbase and graphics/OpenEXR
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenEXR and ilmbase (Industrial Light and Magic) shared object
  names have changed.  You must rebuild all packages that require either
  of these libraries, by using one of these commands:

  # portmaster -r ilmbase -r OpenEXR
    or
  # portupgrade -fr graphics/ilmbase graphics/OpenEXR

  The PORTREVISIONs of all ports that require ilmbase and/or OpenEXR
  have been bumped.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to version
  7.8.3 and Haskell Platform to 2014.2.0.0.  Hence it is recommended to
  rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports and the lang/ghc port
  itself by one of the following commands:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc

  If you use pkg(8) then it is just safer to remove all the GHC-dependent
  packages along with GHC and reinstall everything from scratch.
  Something alone these lines may work:

  # pkg query "%ro" > ghc-pkgs.txt
  # pkg delete -y lang/ghc
  # pkg install -y `cat ghc-pkgs.txt | grep -Ev "/hs-(haskeline|terminfo|transformers|xhtml)"

  IMPORTANT: Perform a backup of the ajaxplorer installation and
  the databases backing it(if you're using that feature).

  First manually remove the ajaxplorer port and install www/pydio
  afterwards.

  Further steps will be available in the pkg-message, which can
  be shown with these commands:

	# pkg info -D pydio

  AFFECTS: users of databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Oracle Berkeley DB 6 has been upgraded to version 6.1.19.  Since the
  previous 6.0 version, the log file format has changed in 6.1.
  Depending on applications used, you may need to take action BEFORE you
  upgrade.  For details, please see the online upgrade manual at
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/upgrading/upgrade_process.html>
  <http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_04/html/installation/upgrade_61_toc.html>

  Note: if you've got Apache installed and depending on db6, you may
  need to upgrade it separately BEFORE upgrading other ports, such as
  Apache modules.

  After that, you must rebuild all applications that link to db6 because
  the shared library name has changed with the upgrade.  To do that:

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r db6-
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr databases/db6

20140714:

  AFFECTS: users of comms/smstools3
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The smstools3 startup screen has been modified to allow smsd to
  change uid/gid by itself. The rc options smsd_logfile, smsd_user
  and smsd_group are not supported anymore, user, group and log
  filename should be specified in the configuration file.

  The sample configuration file has been updated to have defaults
  equivalent to the old ones.

20140624:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/p5-Bucardo
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The bucardo_ctl script has been renamed to bucardo, so, to follow the naming,
  the bucardo_ctl_enable rc variable has been renamed to bucardo_enable.

20140622:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  If you have both security/gnupg AND security/gnupg1 installed, gpgme will
  now automatically detect and use security/gnupg.  Specifically, it will
  search for gpgconf(1) first and use the paths for the binaries provided
  by it.  Failing that, it will search for a binary named "gpg".

  It is no longer possible to specify the location of the gpg binary at
  buildtime to differentiate between version 1.x and version 2.x.  The port
  options GNUPG1 and GNUPG2 now merely add their respective versions of gnupg
  as build and runtime dependencies.

20140618:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/m17n-* textproc/*m17n*
  AUTHOR: Nikola Lecic <nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net>

  devel/m17n-db now incorporates a set of user-contributed input methods and
  a conversion script, formerly available through textproc/m17n-contrib.
  Delete textproc/m17n-contrib first and then update/install devel/m17n-db.

20140616:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: lev@FreeBSD.org

  The subversion port has been overhauled. Some optional parts were extracted
  into separate ports. These ports are:

  www/mod_dav_svn
    instead of option MOD_DAV_SVN.
  security/subversion-gnome-keyring
    instead of option GNOME_KEYRING.
  security/subversion-kwallet
    instead of option KDE_KWALLET.

  If you used devel/subversion with one (or more) of these non-standard
  options, you should install the appropriate port(s) after upgrading
  subversion.

  "mod_dontdothat" is installed unconditionally by www/mod_dav_svn port (it
  depended on the TOOLS option before), but is not activated by default, you
  may need to edit apache's configuration file.

  The devel/subversion port now installs svndiff, svndiff3 and svndiff4
  commands if TOOLS option is enabled. They was skipped before.
  The official names "diff", "diff3" and "diff4" are prefixed with "svn" to
  avoid conflicts with base and other diff versions.

  All libraries and binaries are now stripped if the MAINTAINER_DEBUG
  option is not selected (including all sub-ports, like bindings
  and mod_dav_svn).

20140611:

20140420:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba4 port now re-uses the same logic and startup script as Samba41. So,
  to get net/samba4 runing you need to rename samba4_enable in /etc/rc.conf
  to the samba_sever_enable.

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140416:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg graphics/dri graphics/libGL and related ports
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD 10-STABLE and
  FreeBSD 9-STABLE.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg ports but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  For users in need of working console when using KMS drivers (intel and
  radeon graphics cards) please use the new vt(9) console driver.
  For more information, see https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics and
  https://wiki.freebsd.org/Newcons .

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL

  The library version of the above libraries has been brought in line
  with what upstream expects. To do this all users of these ports need
  to be rebuilt. Portrevisions have been bumped as a consequence.

  # portmaster -r freetype2 -r libxml2 -r pixman -r freeglut -r libxcb
  or
  # portupgrade -rf freetype2 libxml2 pixman freeglut libxcb

  lang/dmd and lang/dmd2 have switched places. Dmd 1.x is no longer supported
  by digitalmars.com and is now the secondary dmd port in the collection.
  Dmd2 is the primary port. What this means to dmd users is that dmd1 is now
  used to invoke dmd 1.x and the dmd command (instead of dmd2) now invokes
  dmd 2.x.

20140413:
  AFFECTS: Users of Python and pkg >= 1.2.7_1
  AUTHOR: koobs@FreeBSD.org

  There have been reports of the following error when upgrading Python ports:

    pkg-static: Plist error, directory listed as a file: <name>.egg-info

  The cause is an outdated or unpatched version of setuptools or distribute
  installed by the user, or leftover from previous upgrades being used during
  the `setup.py install` phase. pkg >= 1.2.7_1 now generates an error where
  previously it did not.

  Users should inspect their ${LOCALBASE}/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages
  directory, and remove any entries that reference versions of
  setuptools or distribute *not* provided by ports or packages.

  Examples of entries that may be removed are:

    1) distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg
    2) setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg
    3) *Any* version of setuptools directly from PyPI via pip or easy_install

  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5 and lang/php55 with Apache module
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The Apache PHP module has been separated from the main PHP port.
  If you had the APACHE OPTION selected, you have to perform the
  following steps:

  1) update your lang/php* options (i.e. 'make config')
  2) rebuild lang/php* port
  3) install www/mod_php* port

  It is *mandatory* to build both ports with the same DEBUG and ZTS
  options, so if you have a threaded Apache (i.e. worker or event MPM)
  you have to select the ZTS option in lang/php* port.

20140307:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-setuptools dependent ports
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  devel/py-setuptools is being used for every python ports (if USE_PYDISTUTILS
  defined) since r336553. Due to PKGORIGIN limitation, we cannot build one
  python port with python27 and the other with python33 since they require
  different setuptools versions which have same PKGORIGIN. With the addition
  of py-setuptools{27,32,33}, we could now have py27-foo and py33-bar coexist
  in one system.

  Note that this is only a short-term solution. It does not help if you need
  coexistence of one port with different python versions, e.g. py27-foo and
  py33-foo.

  Please rebuild all ports that depend on devel/py-setuptools and use
  devel/py-setuptools{27,32,33} instead.

  XX represents python version (27, 32 or 33) in the following steps.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools:devel/py-setuptoolsXX

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o devel/py-setuptoolsXX devel/py-setuptools

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl 5.12 has been removed.  The default Perl is lang/perl5.16.

  pkg(8) users:
    1) Update the origin to point to 5.16:
       pkg set -o lang/perl5.12:lang/perl5.16

    2) Upgrade perl and all dependencies:
       pkg install -Rf lang/perl5.16

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
       pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
       portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f lang/perl5.12

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
       portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

    Conservative:
      portmaster p5-

    Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
      portmaster -r perl-

    Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port specify the name of
      the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.  Also, depending on when
      perl 5.12 was installed last, the prefix may be perl-, perl5- or
      perl5.12-.

20140113:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba41
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  With the introduction of Samba 4.1 corresponding port lost SWAT support
  and made WINBIND support mandatory. As samba4 introduced additional 'samba'
  daemon to the tripplet of nmbd/smbd/winbindd to avoid confusion startup
  script for samba41 was renamed to 'samba_server'. To start the whole band
  up it's enough to add to the rc.conf:

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140112:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libical
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The libical port was updated to 1.0.0. Due to the shared library bump
  and the removal of the .la file, all ports that use libical need to be
  rebuilt.

  # portmaster -r libical
   or
  # portupgrade -fr libical
   or
  # pkg install -fR libical

  AFFECTS: users of lang/go
  AUTHOR: jlaffaye@FreeBSD.org

  Third party Go packages installed via the ports tree are no longer installed
  in GOROOT (PREFIX/go) but in a specific path: PREFIX/share/go

  Affected ports had their PORTREVISION bumped.
  To reinstall these packages via the ports tree, it is needed to deinstall
  them first (the build will fail if the `go` command detects that they
  already exists in GOROOT).

  If you are using these third party Go packages for local Go development,
  you have to add this new path to your GOPATH environment variable.

  The MINIMAL and MODULES options have been removed from archivers/p7zip,
  which now unconditionally installs the 7z, 7za and 7zr, as if the MINIMAL
  option was previously unset.

  The RAR decompression codec, whose source code has a more restrictive
  license that forbids its use for creating RAR archives, has been moved to
  a separate port, archivers/p7zip-codec-rar.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/ruby-bdb or ports-mgmt/portupgrade and databases/db5 or databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  databases/db5 and databases/db6 have recently been updated to fix
  bugs. This changed their patchlevel version.

  However, ruby-bdb used to break during the db[56] upgrade due to a bug
  described in <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=184921>.

  THEREFORE, YOU MUST MANUALLY UPGRADE databases/ruby-bdb INDIVIDUALLY
  TO 0.6.6_2 OR NEWER WHEN USING portupgrade AGAINST databases/db[56]
  PORTS. To achieve that, type:

  # portupgrade databases/ruby-bdb
  or
  # portmaster -x 'db*' databases/ruby-bdb

  before proceeding with other upgrades.

  Should you have corrupted the portupgrade databases, or if ruby-bdb
  refuses to work with the upgraded db* port with errors such as "DB
  needs compatible versions of libdb & db.h", then rebuild the ruby-bdb
  port manually, and fix the portupgrade databases:

  # make -C /usr/ports/databases/ruby-bdb all deinstall install clean
  # pkgdb -fu
  # portupgrade -f db5 db6

  This should return portupgrade to normal operation.

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg, graphics/libGL, graphics/dri, all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD CURRENT.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg port but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    and then
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Berkeley DB versions before and excluding 4.8 have been marked deprecated.
  New port installations should be based on Berkeley DB 5 or 6.

  Note that Oracle Berkeley DB 6 is under the more restrictive Affero GPL v3
  license, be sure to review if using that fits your requirements.

  You can add WITH_BDB_VER=5 or WITH_BDB_VER=6 to /etc/make.conf to have all
  applications that get rebuilt use Oracle Berkeley DB 5 or 6, respectively.

  DO NOT FORCE DELETE older BerkeleyDB packages, that breaks the upgrade
  tools.  Instead, first rebuild the ports that depend on it, then
  remove the old Berkeley DB versions.

  Berkeley DB ports should be able to build/install with an older and a
  newer version version both installed if WITH_BDB_VER is set.  If a
  port then grabs the old Berkeley DB version, that is an issue with the
  port that requires Berkeley DB, and should be reported to the
  maintainer.

  If you are interested in upgrading now already, we have instructions
  at <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The THREADS option has been enabled by default in all Perl. If you're using
  binary packages you need to do :

    # pkg install -Rf perl5

  If you're not using binary packages, and want to switch from non threaded
  Perl to threaded Perl, you need to recompile and reinstall most ports
  depending on Perl. Supposing you have Perl 5.16, you would do:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: The installed Perl package was named perl and is now named perl5, if
	you have not updated your installation in a long time, you may need to
	use "perl-" here.

  AFFECTS: users of dns/nsd
  AUTHOR: erwin@FreeBSD.org

  dns/nsd was updated to the new 4.0.0 major release.

  This version replaces the nsdc control program with nsd-control.
  This requires some manual setup with nsd-control-setup and editing
  of the config files. nsd-control is incompatible with nsdc so when
  that is used in scripts, these should be adapted.  More information:
  http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/svn/nsd/tags/NSD_4_0_0_REL/doc/NSD-4-features

  NSD version 3 is still supported in dns/nsd3.  To keep the old
  version:
  # portmaster -o dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # portupgrade -fo dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # pkg set -o dns/nsd:dns/nsd3

  BIND was removed from the base system.  It is now self-contained
  in ${PREFIX}/etc/namedb, and chroot and symlinking options are
  no longer supported out of the box.

  For users of FreeBSD 9.x and earlier, the LINKS option is no longer
  enabled by default, but still supported.  No other changes should
  affect those users, and updating without changing already set options
  will keep the system in the same state.

  New way to override the default version of a language in the ports
  tree.

  The make variable, DEFAULT_VERSIONS, allows users to override the
  default version defined by the ports tree.

  For example, to declare specific versions for Perl, Ruby and Tcl/Tk,
  it would be defined as:

	DEFAULT_VERSIONS=	perl5=5.18 ruby=2.0 tcltk=8.6

  Today, this only is supported by Perl, Ruby, and Tcl/Tk.

  AFFECTS: 10-CURRENT users with any port depending on converters/libiconv
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  10-CURRENT after r254273 (committed on August 13, 2013) has an
  implementation of iconv enabled by default in libc.

  NOTE: after r341775 (committed on January 29, 2014) and other
  following commits, a few ports, including devel/glib20, depend
  on the converters/libiconv again due to missing functionality in the
  base iconv implementation.

  Due to this change some major overhauling of the ports tree has
  been necessary to move the ports to using that implementation.

  People using pkgng binary packages should have little problems,
  "pkg upgrade" will update all software to not depend on libiconv
  anymore, once updated packages are available. Please make sure to
  perform a "pkg autoremove" after that and check that libiconv is
  correctly removed by it.

  If you are using ports the update requires some manual intervention.
  The following procedure should be followed:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update

  AFFECTS: users of lang/python*
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/python* ports do not install links to 2to3, idle, pydoc, python
  and other binaries anymore. Those were moved into the lang/python2 and
  lang/python3 ports respectively. This change brings us closer to the goal
  of making Python ports usable with different Python versions at the same
  time.

  If you have lang/python2* or lang/python3* installed, please also install
  the associated lang/python2 or lang/python3 port.

  1. update lang/python2* and/or lang/python3*
  2. install lang/python2 and/or lang/python3
  3. install/update lang/python

20130816:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opendx and math/octave-forge-octcdf
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  These two ports have changed the science/netcdf dependency to
  science/netcdf4.  It is recommended that the science/netcdf package
  be deinstalled before rebuilding these ports, otherwise you are likely
  to face port conflicts when building future ports.

20130806:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/eric4
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  Since PKGVERSION=4.5.13_1 the default file destination has changed from
  ${PYTHON_SITELIBDIR}/eric4 to ${DATADIR}.

20130731:
  AFFECTS: users of glib20
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/gio-fam-backend port was removed in the glib 2.36 update.
  Since the gio-fam-backend port was used in USE_GNOME=glib20, all
  dependencies need to be rebuilt. The removal of gio-fam-backend isn't
  critical, glib20 using programs should work just fine if the port is still
  installed. It is not clear however, if glib20 will use the new kqueue
  backend or the old fam backend.

  Note that users of pkg packages can just run the pkg delete command after
  their next update.

  # portmaster -r gio-fam-backend
  # pkg_delete gio-fam-backend-\* (for pkgng: pkg delete gio-fam-backend)
  # portmaster -a

    or

  # portupgrade -rf gio-fam-backend
  # pkg_delete gio-fam-backend-\* (for pkgng: pkg delete gio-fam-backend)
  # portupgrade -a

  AFFECTS: users of Qt 3 and KDE 3
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  All ports based on Qt 3 (including KDE 3 but also ports which used Qt 3
  as a graphical toolkit) expired on 20130701 because Qt 3 and KDE 3 were
  no longer maintained upstream.  These ports have been removed today.

  Users of KDE 3 are advised to switch to another desktop environment
  provided in the Ports Collection, e.g. KDE 4 or Xfce.

  Users of Qt 3 are advised to upgrade to the Qt 4 counterpart(s).

  AFFECTS: users of net/openafs
  AUTHOR: bjk@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenAFS 1.6.5 release is a security release which requires substantial
  configuration changes to the AFS servers in addition to the software update,
  in order to be fully protected.  The entry for OPENAFS-SA-2013-003 on
  http://www.openafs.org/security/ has links to the upgrade documentation.
  The procedure involves rekeying the cell to a non-DES krb5 key, stored in
  a krb5 keytab named rxkad.keytab in PREFIX/etc/openafs/server/.

  AFFECTS: users of japanese/mozc-server and japanese/mozc-el
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The bin/mozc_emacs_helper program is now built and installed by
  japanese/mozc-server because the build processes are heavily
  overlapped with each other and the helper program does not depend on
  most of what mozc-server does actually.  To upgrade them, please remove
  mozc-el first to prevent a conflict with the installed bin/mozc_emacs_helper.

  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The logcheck port now provides a configuration option controlling
  installation of the crontab file. When installing the port interactively,
  the port option is enabled by default to mimic previous behavior.

  When the port is installed non-interactively (BATCH=yes) the crontab
  file *will not* be installed automatically. If the EXAMPLES port option
  is enabled, the crontab file can be installed manually at a later time
  from EXAMPLESDIR/crontab.in.

  AFFECTS: users of www/zend-framework
  AUTHOR: wg@FreeBSD.org

  zend-framework has been updated to 2.2.1 and old 1.12.0 has been copied
  to www/zend-framework1. If you wish to stay with the older version run:

  # portmaster -o www/zend-framework1 www/zend-framework
    or
  # portupgrade -fo www/zend-framework1 www/zend-framework
    or
  # pkg set -o www/zend-framework:www/zend-framework1

  AFFECTS: users of net/avahi-gtk
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  Avahi was updated to 0.6.31, due to changes in the avahi-gtk port it will
  be necessary to remove the avahi-gtk port before updating.
  Users of pkg packages can skip this step.

  # pkg_delete -f avahi-gtk\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f avahi-gtk

  # portupgrade net/avahi-gtk

20130711:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/py-ldns
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The dns/py-ldns port now only installs the Python bits, and depends on
  dns/ldns.  Because of that, you cannot just do a regular upgrade, it
  would install dns/ldns overwriting existing files and removing them when
  removing the old version of dns/py-ldns.

  # pkg_delete -f py-ldns-\*
  # cd /usr/ports/dns/py-ldns && make clean && make install clean
    or
  # pkg delete -fg py-ldns-\*
  # pkg install -f dns/py-ldns

  AFFECTS: users of www/ajaxplorer
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Ajaxplorer was updated to 5.0.1. This is a major update and some
  manual intervention may be needed.

  Before upgrading you should preserve the following files in WWWDIR
  (defaults to PREFIX/www/ajaxplorer) if you have customized them:

  conf/bootstrap_conf.php
  conf/bootstrap_context.php
  conf/bootstrap_plugins.php
  conf/bootstrap_repositories.php

  and put them back after the upgrade.

  If you are using a database backend you will need to manually
  update your database table using the sql script the port will
  install at WWWDIR/conf/conf/4.2.3-5.0.0-db-upgrade.sql

  Don't forget to check the documentation about upgrading from
  version 4.x at:

  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The KDE Software Compilation 4.10.4 was committed a few days ago, and
  version 4.10.5 was committed today.

  They include better support for using clang as the compiler, but that
  requires recompiling all KDE ports which depend on x11/kdelibs4. Most
  ports which fall into this category are already part of the KDE Software
  Compilation and have been updated to version 4.10.5, but those released
  separately need to be rebuilt manually.

  If you are building your KDE ports with clang, doing the following is
  recommended:

  # portmaster -r kdelibs-4\*
    or
  # portupgrade -fr x11/kdelibs4
    or
  # pkg install -fR x11/kdelibs4

  Alternatively, to avoid rebuilding the ports which are part of the 4.10.5
  update:

  # portmaster -x \*-4.10.5\* -r kdelibs-4\*
    or
  # portupgrade -x \*-4.10.5\* -fr x11/kdelibs4

20130627:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Since June 22nd, portmaster no longer relies on 'WITH_PKGNG' to be defined,
  or ports to be checked out to enable pkgng support.

  It now considers whether or not pkg is installed and registered with itself.

  I.e., if this returns data, pkgng is considered in use:

    # pkg info pkg

  It's possible that you may have tested pkgng in the past, ran pkg2ng, and
  never fully committed to it by setting WITH_PKGNG. If this is the case,
  uninstall pkg with pkg_info/pkg_delete and also remove the stale database,
  rm /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite.

  This could manifest itself as portmaster -L showing the wrong versions, or
  portmaster no longer detecting installed packages correctly.

  Note that PORTS still require WITH_PKGNG=yes in make.conf if you are not
  running CURRENT.

20130627:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba36
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba has updated format of it's printing tdbs (ntprinting.tdb, ntforms.tdb,
  ntdrivers.tdb) to include character encoding. When updating from Samba 3.5
  or earlier to Samba 3.6 or 4.0 these tdbs need to be migrated to new registry
  based printing management. This implies also character conversion.

  You have to specify the correct code page for the conversion, see iconv -l.
  The mostly used one is Windows Latin1 which is CP1252.

  You can correctly view the tdb with:

  # net printing dump encoding=CP1252 /path/to/ntprinters.tdb

  or migrate it with e.g.:

  # net printing migrate encoding=CP1252 /path/to/ntprinters.tdb

  If you migrate printers it is suggest to do it in the following order:

  ntforms.tdb
  ntdrivers.tdb
  ntprinting.tdb

  Don't forget to rename, move or delete these files in /var/db/samba after
  the migration.

20130623:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/mikutter003
  AUTHOR: tota@FreeBSD.org

  net-im/mikutter003 has been removed from the ports tree because the
  Twitter API version 1.0 was deprecated on 2013-05-07 and mikutter003,
  which uses the API 1.0, won't work.
  Please consider using net-im/mikutter instead of this.

  1. deinstall mikutter003
  2. upgrade Ruby to 1.9( or later) (see the entry 20130527)
  3. install net-im/mikutter

20130623:
  AFFECTS: users of www/magento
  AUTHOR: melvyn@magemana.nl

  Magento has been updated to 1.7.0.2 on 2013-06-03. With it a stricter file
  system policy is enforced on the port. If you (or your customer) rely heavily
  on Magento Connect via the backend to install extensions, your quickfix is:

  # chown -R www: ${PREFIX}/www/magento
  # chmod -R u+w ${PREFIX}/www/magento

  The more conservative approach:
  # chown -R www: ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/code/{local,community} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/{design,locale} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/{downloader,skin}

  # chmod -R u+w ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/code/{local,community} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/{design,locale} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/{downloader,skin}

  The conservative approach will alert you to extensions that try to write in
  Magento core, while allowing clean extensions to install properly (corner
  cases may exist).

20130619:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  devel/subversion has been upgraded from 1.7.10 to 1.8.0

  If you want to upgrade, and use http/https access to repositories,
  please check, that the SERF option is enabled, as NEON support
  is gone. Also, mod_dontdothat and svnauthz_validate are
  now enabled with one option TOOLS, among other new tools
  and SVNMUCC is enabled always.

  subversion-1.7.x is available as devel/subversion17

  To stay on subversion-1.7.x set in /etc/make.conf
  WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=17
  and use the following command

  # pkg set -o devel/subversion:devel/subversion17
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion17 devel/subversion

20130614:
  AFFECTS: users who set port options in make.conf
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  Configuring options in make.conf using variables like OPTIONS_SET and
  OPTIONS_UNSET now also suppresses the option dialog for those options.
  This means that when building a port the option dialog will only appear if
  there are truly new options that have not been configured before using either
  the dialog or make.conf.  This allows you to set options like DOCS, NLS,
  X11, etc. once for all ports and not have option dialogs pop up if those are
  the only options.  For a list of variables you can set in make.conf to
  control options see Mk/bsd.options.mk.

20130612:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl* and any port that depends on it

  lang/perl5.12 has been upgraded from version 5.12.4 to 5.12.5
  lang/perl5.14 has been upgraded from version 5.14.2 to 5.14.4
  lang/perl5.16 has been upgraded from version 5.16.2 to 5.16.3

  The directory structure where Perl is installed has also been modified:
  "major.minor" is now used instead of "major.minor.patchlevel".

  The "perl-after-upgrade" script has been removed.

  Please rebuild all Perl ports and all ports that depend on it:

  rebuild or reinstall all the dependent ports by one of the following
  commands:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc
    or
  # pkg install -fR lang/ghc

  Note that prefixes used for hs- ports (Cabal packages) have been

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby18
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 1.8 to 1.9. First, stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you'll need to rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  If you use portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby19 lang/ruby18
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-1.9

  If you use portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby18
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby19 # if you have it installed
  # portupgrade -f ports-mgmt/portupgrade
  # portupgrade -x ruby-1.8.\* -fr lang/ruby18

  After these steps are complete, you can pkg_delete ruby 1.8 if you
  no longer need it.

  If you use pkgng:
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby18:lang/ruby19
  # pkg install -fR lang/ruby19

  If you wish to keep the 1.8 version as default, add the following lines
  to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 1.8 as default version.
  #
  RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.8

  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  X.Org, including libraries and some drivers, was updated.  If you are
  running the default X.Org distribution, no special upgrade procedure
  should be necessary.

  If you are running with WITH_NEW_XORG= make sure to update and rebuild
  all installed drivers since xorg-server has been updated.

20130520:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/elasticsearch
  AUTHOR: tj@FreeBSD.org

  This is the first stable release based on Lucene 4. We recommend testing
  the upgrade before doing it in production.

  Upgrading from 0.20 requires a full cluster restart.

  In order to be able to downgrade, stop indexing new data, issue a flush
  request, do the upgrade and only enable indexing of new data once you
  are certain that you no longer need to downgrade.  Once new data has
  been indexed, downgrading is no longer possible. To be extra safe, back
  up your data before upgrading.

  AFFECTS: users of net/activemq
  AUTHOR: tj@FreeBSD.org

  The JVM used by activemq has changed to OpenJDK 7. You will need to
  make sure javavmwrapper is configured to use the installed
  java/openjdk7 JVM.

20130512:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/hs-git-annex
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  On FreeBSD, git-annex incorrectly calculated SHA256 hashes for files
  added to the annex repository due to the BSD-style output of
  /sbin/sha256.  The result of this is silent data corruption.

  This problem has been fixed, but every file stored in an annex
  repository will fail a `git-annex fsck` after the upgrade.  Thus,
  before updating, it is wise to issue the command below and restore the
  files.

  $ git-annex uninit

  Corruptions can then be found by finding all files with the same hash.
  Note that only files that were mishashed to the same location are a
  problem.

  AFFECTS: users of TeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  One can now choose TeXLive or teTeX by using TEX_DEFAULT.
  Specifying TEX_DEFAULT=texlive, almost all of ports which use TeX
  will install and depend on TeXLive-based ones.  Note that the
  default value is still "tetex" and the two cannot coexist.  You need
  to remove all of the TeX-related packages based on teTeX to try
  TeXLive.

20130507:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/usbmuxd or comms/libimobiledevice
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  libusbmuxd and libimobiledevice versions have changed. Please, rebuild

  libplist Python bindings were split from the main port. To get them you
  need to install devel/py-libplist.

20130506:
  AFFECTS: users of TeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  TeXLive ports have been imported.  Although most of ports still depend
  on teTeX at this moment, they will be converted to use TeXLive.

  The directory layout of them is as follows.  Please use print/texlive-full
  if you are not familiar with how each component works.  Finer-grained
  ports will be added (specifically, meta ports for smaller installation
  and so on).  Note that the full installation needs around 3GB of disk space.

  teTeX-based ports and TeXLive are mutually exclusive.  This means TeXLive
  ports cannot be installed when teTeX is already installed.  You need
  to remove all of the TeX-related packages based on teTeX to try TeXLive.
  Migration procedure will be announced when conversion of the port
  dependency is completed.

  * Meta port
   - print/texlive-full: meta port to install all of the TeXLive components

  * Libraries
   - devel/tex-kpathsea: kpathsea library
   - devel/tex-web2c: WEB2C toolchain and TeX engines
   - print/tex-ptexenc: character code conversion library for pTeX

  * Base part of the TeXLive
   - print/texlive-base: binary programs in TeXLive
   - print/texlive-texmf: macro and font data in TeXLive
   - print/texlive-infra: tlmgr dependency (Perl modules)
   - print/tex-formats:

  * TeX Formats
   - print/tex-formats: TeX, LaTeX, PDFTeX, AMSTeX, ConTeXT, CSLaTeX,
       EplainTeX, METAFONT, MLTeX, PDFTeX, TeXsis
   - print/tex-aleph: Aleph/Lambda

  AFFECTS: users of security/libgcrypt and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The libgcrypt port has been updated to 1.5.2 and all shared libraries
  versions have been bumped. So you need to rebuild all applications that
  depend on libgcrypt. Do something like:

  # portmaster -r libgcrypt
    or
  # portupgrade -rf libgcrypt

  Alternatively, you may install sysutils/bsdadminscripts, run pkg_libchk and
  rebuild all detected ports:

  # pkg_libchk | tee /tmp/rebuild
  # awk -F':' '/libgcrypt.so/ {print $1}' /tmp/rebuild | sort | uniq \

  This only affects people who are _building_ binary packages for pkgng. If you
  are building from ports please ignore this. This step is optional.

  It is recommended to rebuild all packages and then have your users run 'pkg

20130424:
  AFFECTS: users of print/psutils-a4 or print/psutils-letter
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/psutils-a4 and print/psutils-letter have been merged into a single port
  print/psutils.  The default paper size in psnup(1), psresize(1), and
  pstops(1) is now selected via an environment variable and/or a configuration
  file of libpaper(3).  For more detail, see papersize(5) and paperconfig(8)
  manual page.    If you prefer A4 or letter size by default as the old
  version did, please install print/papersize-default-a4 or

  AFFECTS: users of */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  Due to some unexpected dynamic linking problems, Haskell Cabal ports with
  binaries that link to their own libraries may not work.  With default
  configuration, the following ports are known to have this problem:
  Agda, BNFC, pandoc, and uuagc.  (Their port revision are now bumped.)

  In general, it is recommended to rebuild the port if you are
  experiencing that the corresponding binary will not start, e.g.:

  % agda
  Shared object "libHSAgda-2.3.2-ghc7.4.2.so" not found, required by "agda"

20130329:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster

  the instructions in pkg-message to fix the filesystem permissions on
  OpenSMTPD spool directories.

20130327:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.10.1. kdelibs4 does no longer
  directly use aspell or hspell, to regain their functionality enable
  corresponding option in textproc/enchant.
  A number of ports have been split and must be deinstalled before
  upgrading:

  # pkg_delete -f kdegames-4\* kde-workspace-4\* kde-wallpapers-4\*

20130319:
  AFFECTS: users of ports
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Ports now use ports-mgmt/dialog4ports to render and interact with the
  options dialog in 'make config'. This will be automatically built and
  installed on the first use.

  dialog4ports provides a new UI able to represent all the features provided
  by the new options framework.

  AFFECTS: users of converters/libiconv and devel/gettext
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  libiconv now handles the lib/charset.alias file instead of devel/gettext.
  If you are using pkgng 'and' upgrading from source with portupgrade or
  portmaster, first delete gettext, upgrade libiconv, then reinstall gettext.

  This will break sudo, so you *must* do this in a root shell (sudo -i)
  if you use sudo.

  # pkg delete -f devel/gettext
  # portmaster converters/libiconv devel/gettext
    or
  # pkg delete -f devel/gettext
  # portupgrade converters/libiconv devel/gettext

  # portupgrade -fo textproc/apache-solr3 textproc/apache-solr
    or
  # pkg set -o textproc/apache-solr:textproc/apache-solr3

20130218:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4-devel
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  The port was renamed into net/samba4 and is going to replace older
  development version of Samba4. You can upgrade it with:

  # portmaster -o net/samba4 net/samba4-devel

  In case you want to upgrade from net/samba36 make sure, that you've
  made backup of /usr/local/etc/smb.conf and the content of /var/db/samba/
  directory.

  There is no direct upgrade path from Samba3 to Samba4, but you can
  always try:

  # portmaster -o net/samba4 net/samba36

  Make sure you've read instructions from the supplied README.FreeBSD
  file and read all the relevant pages on http://wiki.samba.org/

  We still miss necessary support for Samba4 from base ntpd and bind9,
  port versions are also are not ready yet, but been worked on.

  Please note, that Samba4 is still in it's early days, so there are
  bugs both from my side and it's own, so be careful with placing it
  into production.

20130206:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/boxbackup
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  The default location of the configuration files changed from
  /usr/local/etc/box to /usr/local/etc/boxbackup. Move your

     mv /usr/local/etc/box /usr/local/etc/boxbackup

20130206:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/wbar
  AUTHOR: nivit@FreeBSD.org

  wbar has been updated to 2.3.4. The new version uses a different icon
  for the dock background, so you have to replace the old one in your
  config file ~/.wbar

  Replace

    i: /usr/local/share/pixmaps/wbar/osxbarback.png

  with

    i: /usr/local/share/pixmaps/wbar/dock.png

20130206:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libtasn1 and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  libtasn1 has been updated to 2.14 and all shared libraries versions have
  been bumped. So you need to rebuild all applications that depend on
  libtasn1.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -r libtasn1
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr security/libtasn1
  If you use pkgng with binary packages:
        pkg install -fR security/libtasn1

20130206:
  AFFECTS: users of Tcl/Tk

20130205:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  Note that the recent devel/libffi update caused some breakage in the Haskell
  ports with the DYNAMIC option enabled.  The problem has been identified and
  fixed since then.  All Haskell ports have been updated to their latest stable
  versions or bumped as DYNAMIC is enabled by default.

  Hence it is recommended to rebuild or reinstall all ports depending on GHC
  by one of the following commands:

  # portmaster -w -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc
    or
  # pkg install -fR lang/ghc

20130205:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/libreoffice
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  LibreOffice has been updated to 3.6.5 with a bundle version of libcmis. The

  it to version 0.3.

20130205:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  gnutls has been updated to 2.12.23 and all shared libraries versions have
  been bumped. So you need to rebuild all applications that depend on
  gnutls.

        portmaster -r gnutls
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr security/gnutls
  If you use pkgng with binary packages:
        pkg install -fR security/gnutls

20130204:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zfstools
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  The zfstools package has dropped the 'rubygem-' prefix and now installs
  its binary files to PREFIX/sbin instead of PREFIX/bin.

20130204:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/qt4-phonon, multimedia/qt4-phonon-gst
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  kde-runtime and kde-workspace ports have been split, they must be
  deinstalled before running any port upgrade tool:

  # pkg_delete -f kdemultimedia-4\* kdenetwork-4\* \
    kde-workspace-4\* kde-runtime-4\*

20130202:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: rm@FreeBSD.org

  deluge port had switched to using libtorrent-rasterbar 0.16 as backend. Since
  both of the versions of libtorrent are conflicting with each other, you need
  to deinstall libtorrent-rasterbar-15 and libtorrent-rasterbar-15-python first
  and then update deluge as usual. Please also keep in mind, that deluge does
  not work via http-proxy when libtorrent-rasterbar 0.16 is used.

20130131:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/boost-libs
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  It is recommended to move to another FastCGI implementation, e.g. PHP-FPM
  (lang/php5).

20130113:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  security/openvpn has been upgraded to the IPv6-capable v2.3.0.
  This upgrade moves easy-rsa into a separate package in
  security/easy-rsa that is pre-selected as default run-time dependency,
  and changes installed file layout a bit.

  security/openvpn22 retains the prior OpenVPN 2.2.2 version.
  If you want to continue using this version, use one of these commands:

  # portmaster -o security/openvpn22 security/openvpn
    or
  # portupgrade -o security/openvpn22 security/openvpn
    or

20130110:
  AFFECTS: everyone using csup(1), net/cvsup, or cvs(1) to update the
  ports tree
  AUTHOR: wblock@FreeBSD.org

  On February 28, 2013, the CVSup and CVS services will end:
  http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports-announce/2012-September/000026.html

  csup(1), net/cvsup, and cvs(1) will no longer be able to update the
  ports tree.  Please switch to one of the alternate update methods of
  portsnap(8) or devel/subversion before that time.  The Handbook has
  information on using these update methods:
  http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html

20130108:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libvanessa_socket, mail/perdition
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  The update of devel/libvanessa_socket to 0.0.12 (used by Perdition)
  adds IPv6 support.  If the hostname in bind_address has both IPv4 and
  IPv6 addresses in DNS, then Perdition will ONLY listen on IPv6.

  If you prefer to continue to use IPv4, you need to change the
  bind_address in /usr/local/etc/perdition/perdition.conf to use an
  explicit IPv4 address.  This can be in addition to, or instead of,
  the current hostname, depending on whether you want to use IPv6 or
  not.  If your Perdition server does not have an IPv6 address
  listed in DNS, this change does not affect you.

20130108:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cfengine*
  AUTHOR: gjb@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/cfengine has been created as a master port for the set of
  sysutils/cfengine* ports.  Users interested in tracking the latest
  stable branch of cfengine should update their port origins to use
  the new port, for example:

  # portmaster -o sysutils/cfengine sysutils/cfengine33
    or
  # portupgrade -fo sysutils/cfengine sysutils/cfengine33
    or
  # pkg set -o sysutils/cfengine33:sysutils/cfengine

  Users that switch their port origin and later wish to remain on
  a particular cfengine release can override the default version by
  adding CFENGINE_VERSION to /etc/make.conf, where CFENGINE_VERSION
  is a value from:

    # make -V VERSIONS

20130103:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/docproj*
  AUTHOR: doceng@FreeBSD.org

  textproc/docproj no longer requires WITH_JADETEX to be set to 'yes' or
  'no', and by default, will enable the JADETEX dependencies.

  The textproc/docproj-jadetex port has been removed as a result of this
  change.

  Users that have installed textproc/docproj and have set
  WITH_JADETEX=no during compile time should update the package origin
  to use textproc/docproj-nojadetex:

  # portmaster -o textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-nojadetex
  or
  # portupgrade -fo textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-nojadetex
  or
  # pkg set -o textproc/docproj-nojadetex:textproc/docproj

  Users that have installed textproc/docproj-jadetex should update the
  package origin to use the textproc/docproj port:

  # portmaster -o textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-jadetex
  or
  # portupgrade -fo textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-jadetex
  or
  # pkg set -o textproc/docproj-jadetex:textproc/docproj

  Users that have installed textproc/docproj and have set
  WITH_JADETEX=yes will not need to make any changes.

20130103:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/baresip
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Baresip is tightly linked to the versions of audio/re and audio/rem, and
  will not build against different versions.

  To update without problems, the -R flag for portupgrade is mandatory, or
  build will fail.  Portmaster and pkgng will handle this correctly.

20130103:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  VirtualBox has been updated and does now depend on devel/kBuild instead
  of devel/kBuild-devel. Both are in conflict with each other so this has
  to be resolved manually. kBuild is only a build dependency so it is safe
  to remove installed kBuild before updating.

  # pkg_delete -f kBuild-\*

20130102:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSMTPD port has been updated to the latest portable snapshot. There

  been changed from 44 to 0. Please rebuild all ports that depends on it:

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -r libical
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr devel/libical
  If you use pkgng with binary packages:
        pkg install -fR devel/libical

20121228:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/innotop, multimedia/zoneminder
  net-mgmt/netdot, ports-mgmt/tinderbox, ports-mgmt/tinderbox-devel
  sysutils/watchmen, www/MT

  The above mentioned ports were converted to depend on
  databases/p5-DBD-mysql. That will cause messages like

  ===>  p5-DBD-mysql-4.021 conflicts with installed package(s):
        p5-DBD-mysql55-4.021

  To prevent this run one of the following commands to fix the
  dependencies.

  # portmaster -o databases/p5-DBD-mysql databases/p5-DBD-mysql55
    or
  # portupgrade -fo databases/p5-DBD-mysql databases/p5-DBD-mysql55
    or
  # pkg set -o databases/p5-DBD-mysql55:databases/p5-DBD-mysql

20121220:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  Note that the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler has been updated to
  version 7.4.2.

  Please rebuild or reinstall all dependent ports by issuing one of the

        pkg install -fR devel/icu

20121212:
  AFFECTS: users of openldap24-client who uses SASL
  AUTHOR: Xin Li <delphij@FreeBSD.org>

  There is a change in the openldap24-client port which removes the SASL
  option.  If the user previously install openldap24-client, but enabled

  database. Also see UPDATING entry 20121010 if you are on a recent CURRENT
  and do not want to use pkg.

  This is optional and not currently required.

  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg install clean
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster config build deinstall install clean
  # echo 'WITH_PKGNG=yes' >> /etc/make.conf

20121010:
  AFFECTS: users of CURRENT (OSVERSION >= 1000017)
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  The ports tree is now using pkgng as the default package manager
  for HEAD.  This only affects users of CURRENT -- users of other
  branches need not take any action.

  To keep pkg_install as the default package manager, use the new
  WITHOUT_PKGNG knob in make.conf

  To make the switch:

  1) Set WITHOUT_PKGNG=yes in make.conf and upgrade all your ports to
  the latest available versions using your favourite tools.

  2) Install ports-mgmt/pkg

  3) Remove WITHOUT_PKGNG from make.conf and run:

	# pkg2ng

  The options for ImageMagick have been changed to match commonly used
  option names. If you are using a customized build, please reconfigure
  your port options with "make config".

  AFFECTS: users of net/spread and net/spread4
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The ports net/spread and net/spread4 are using now the
  reserved UID/GID 282 instead (user|group)next.

20120722:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mutt-devel has been moved to mail/mutt, since 1.5 has been around
  for a while.

  Should you wish to stick with version 1.4 at this time;

  # portmaster -o mail/mutt14 mutt

20120721:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/libogg
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  There is a new version of libogg (1.3.0) and the shared library version
  has been bumped (ogg.7 to ogg.8).  All ports that have an identifiable
  direct dependency on this library have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.
  However, some ports that pull in the library indirectly may continue to
  look for the old version.  To ensure that all are updated, perform this
  step:

  # portmaster -r libogg
  or
  # portupgrade -rf libogg

20120717:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The options of ProFTPD have been made much more user-friendly.
  As the modules are all shared libraries, all possible modules are built
  and installed. The following modules are now in separate slave ports:

  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_odbc: mod_sql_odbc
  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_sqlite: mod_sql_sqlite
  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_tds: mod_sql_tds
  net/proftpd-mod_ldap: mod_ldap and mod_quotatab_ldap

20120716:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The following port options have been reorganized:
  The OPENLDAP option has been renamed to LDAP.
  The MAGNET and CML options have been withdrawn in favor of new LUA option.

20120716:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  The postscreen-to-smtpd protocol has changed.  To avoid "cannot
  receive connection attributes" warnings and dropped connections,
  execute the command "postfix reload".

20120716:
  AFFECTS: Nobody
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  The FreeBSD ports tree switched from CVS to Subversion. A Subversion
  to CVS exporter is in place to continue the support of CVSup.

20120709:
  AFFECTS: users of math/metis
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  The older version of metis has been moved to math/metis4, and
  math/metis has been updated to 5.0.2.  Dependent ports still use
  the old API, and the different versions of metis cannot coexist, so
  most users should update with:

  # portmaster -o math/metis4 math/metis
  # portmaster -r math/metis4

  or the equivalent.

20120702:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/couchdb
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org, Adam Strohl <adams-ports@ateamsystems.com>

  The couchdb port has an unfortunate side effect; versions before 1.2.0
  will clobber local.ini.  The port will refuse to build if that file is
  present and an earlier version is installed, however no such protection
  can be afforded to package installation.

  To upgrade from 1.1.0 and earlier, simply move PREFIX/etc/couchdb/local.ini
  out of the way until the upgrade is complete.

20120702:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/mikutter
  AUTHOR: tota@FreeBSD.org

  The net-im/mikutter has been updated to 0.1.1.810 which is required
  Ruby 1.9.2 or later. Before upgrading this port, please see the entry
  20110822 in this file to upgrade Ruby to 1.9.

  If you want to stay with 0.0.3 (requires Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2 or later),
  please run the following command:

  # portmaster -o net-im/mikutter003 net-im/mikutter
    or
  # portupgrade -o net-im/mikutter003 net-im/mikutter

20120630:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.16 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.12, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f perl-5.12.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

  The default version for Perl has also been changed from 5.12 to 5.14.

20120623:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/xfce4-utils
  AUTHOR: xfce@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been discontinued, and installs files that conflict with
  the new versions of misc/xfce4-appfinder and x11-wm/xfce4-session.

  # pkg_delete -f xfce4-utils-\*
  # portmaster misc/xfce4-appfinder x11-wm/xfce4-session

20120618:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db5
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/db5 port has been upgraded to BerkeleyDB 5.3.  This
  entails a shared library bump.

  Before upgrading this port, check if your applications use
  transactional data bases, and if they do, prepare them for a log file
  format upgrade.  YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE YOU UPGRADE THE DB5 PORT!  See:
  http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_02/html/upgrading/upgrade_process.html

  All packages that depend on db5 need to be rebuilt due to the shared
  library version change.  The full changelog is at
  http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/products/berkeleydb/html/changelog_5_3.html

  To upgrade the packages that need Berkeley DB 5, please
  issue one of the following commands (depending on your preferred tool):

  # portmaster -r db5-5
    or
  # portupgrade -fr databases/db5

20120616:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The lighttpd startup script has been changed and is now compatible to the
  apache startup script. The "reload" subcommand now sends a SIGHUP to the
  process and triggers cycling of log files. The new command "graceful"
  performs a graceful restart (similar to former "reload") and "gracefulstop"
  performs a graceful stop. The "check" command has been replaced with
  the "configtest" command.

20120615:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/akonadi
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The latest Akonadi update includes critical bug fixes. Manual
  intervention is required for people using local MySQL database (the
  default configuration) as backend:

  $ akonadictl stop

  Wait a bit, and make sure that akonadiserver and akonadi_control are
  not running. Kill them if needed. Then, you have two alternatives:

  $ mysql_install_db --force \
    --defaults-file=~/.local/share/akonadi/mysql.conf \
    --datadir=~/.local/share/akonadi/db_data \
    --basedir=$(dirname `dirname $(which mysql_install_db)`)
  $ rm ~/.local/share/akonadi/mysql.conf

  ...or...

  $ rm -r ~/.local/share/akonadi

  In the latter case, Akonadi will have to recache your personal data
  (might take a while). Akonadi is only a cache, no data will be lost.
  Then:

  $ akonadictl start

20120613:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/djvulibre and graphics/djvulibre-nox11
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  DjVuLibre been updated to 3.5.25.3.  The Qt 3.x GUI support that was in
  graphics/djvulibre has been removed (users of this GUI should consider
  switching to the new Qt 4.x GUI in graphics/djview4), and
  graphics/djvulibre-nox11 has been merged back into graphics/djvulibre.
  To update DjVuLibre, you can use:

  # pkg_delete djvulibre-\?.\*
  # portmaster -o graphics/djvulibre djvulibre-nox11

  You should then update any installed ports that link to the djvulibre shared
  library: converters/pdf2djvu, graphics/djview4, graphics/okular, and --
  if optional djvulibre support was enabled -- graphics/ImageMagick,
  graphics/apvlv, and graphics/evince.

20120612:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql-libpqxx
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  postgresql-libpqxx has been updated to 4.0. If you want to stick
  with version 3, install postgresql-libpqxx30:

  # portmaster -o databases/postgresql-libpqxx30 postgresql-libpqxx

20120612:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/gdal
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Language bindings (Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby) were moved to separate
  ports. Please install them if required. The new ports are:

    Perl binding:   graphics/p5-Geo-GDAL
    PHP binding:    graphics/php-gdal
    Python binding: graphics/py-gdal
    Ruby binding:   graphics/ruby-gdal

20120605:
  AFFECTS: users of net/p5-ZConf
  AUTHOR: vvelox@vvelox.net

  Please append '.set' to all sets for the FS backend. This was done to prevent
  collisions between config and set names. Previously the config
  "someConfig/default" would collide with the set "default" for "someConfig".

20120603:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  Note that The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler and the Haskell Platform
  have been updated to versions 7.4.1 and 2012.2.0.0, respectively.  At the
  same time, all Haskell ports have been updated to their latest working
  versions.

  To follow the changes, please issue one of the following commands
  (depending on the tool used):

  # portmaster -r ghc
    or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc


20120531:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/png
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The PNG library has been updated to version 1.5.10.  Please rebuild all
  ports that depend on it.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -r png-
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr graphics/png

20120531:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/koffice-kde4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KOffice 2 has been replaced by Calligra. You are encouraged to
  deinstall any KOffice port and install equivalent Calligra ones:

  # pkg_delete \*koffice\*
  # portmaster editors/calligra <additional l10n ports>

20120530:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql*-server
  AUTHOR: jgh@FreeBSD.org

  Affected users are those who use the crypt(text, text) function with
  DES encryption in the optional pg_crypto module. Passwords affected
  are those that contain characters that cannot be represented with
  7-bit ASCII. If a password contains a character that has the most
  significant bit set (0x80), and DES encryption is used, that character
  and all characters after it will be ignored.

20120530:
  AFFECTS: users of net/nss-pam-ldapd
  AUTHOR: scheidell@FreeBSD.org

  The net/nss-pam-ldapd port no longer provides an option for SASL. This has
  been sourced out to the new net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl port, to accommodate
  users using packages (see ports/162240). Users with openldap-sasl-client
  installed are encouraged to change the port's origin to:
  net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl using their favorite ports management tool.
  Example for portmaster:
  portmaster -o net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl nss-pam-ldapd

20120527:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/qt4-gui
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Qt started using the raster graphics system engine, which relies on
  shared memory. Be sure to check pkg-message.

20120525:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kdepim4, deskutils/kdepim4-runtime
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  kdepim4 has been updated to 4.8.3. For those who prefer old
  kdepim-4.4.11.1 deskutils/kdepim44* ports have been added.
  To stay with kdepim-4.4.11.1 run the following commands:

  # portmaster -o deskutils/kdepim44-runtime kdepim-runtime-4\*
  # portmaster -o deskutils/kdepim44 kdepim-4\*

20120525:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.8.3. Several ports were split,
  thus manual intervention into update procedure is required:

  # pkg_delete -f kde-runtime-\* ruby\*-kdebindings-korundum\* \
    kalgebra-4\* kdeaccessibility-4\* kdeutils-4\* kde-baseapps-\* \
    plasma-applet-icontasks\*
  # portmaster -a

  AFFECTS: users of dns/poweradmin
  AUTHOR: Edmondas Girkantas <eg@fbsd.lt>

  Some database changes have been made between version 2.1.4 and 2.1.5,
  upgrading needs to be done manually by running the following SQL:

  For MySQL users:

  ALTER TABLE `zones` ADD `zone_templ_id` INT( 11 ) NOT NULL;
  ALTER TABLE zones ENGINE = InnoDB;
  ALTER TABLE zone_templ ENGINE = InnoDB;
  ALTER TABLE zone_templ_records ENGINE = InnoDB;

  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  PHP has been updated to 5.4. Suhosin patch has been disabled until the
  new version will be released (soon). Suhosing extension will take more
  time. LINKTHR option is now enabled by default, be sure to flag it if
  you are updating using an old saved configuration. sqlite2 extension
  has been permanently removed.
  If you want to remain at PHP 5.3, a new port (lang/php53) has been
  created for such purpose.

20120513:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/smokeping
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Smokeping has been updated to 2.6.7, and the web server configuration
  has changed. FastCGI is now preferred. Please check the documentation
  that your web server configuration is OK.

20120512:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/p5-XML-SAX
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  p5-XML-SAX (X-S) was split into p5-XML-SAX-Base (X-S-B) and p5-XML-SAX for
  version 0.99.  Since X-S-B now installs some files formerly installed by X-S
  the package for X-S must be deinstalled before updating X-S.

  # pkg_delete -fx p5-XML-SAX
  # portmaster textproc/p5-XML-SAX

  (users of pkgng can substitute pkg_delete with pkg delete)

20120511:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/xpdf
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  In order to allow graphics/xpdf and graphics/poppler-utils to coexist,
  graphics/xpdf binaries have been moved from ${LOCALBASE}/bin to
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf. The symlink ${LOCALBASE}/bin/xpdf points to
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf/xpdf. However the other utilities installed by
  the xpdf port conflict with poppler-utils, no symlinks are maintained.
  Applicaions and scripts which use the pdf* utilities provided by
  graphics/xpdf must reference them using their new location, specify
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf in $PATH, or use the same utilities provided by
  graphics/poppler-utils.

20120510:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gitolite
  AUTHOR: milki@rescomp.berkeley.edu

  gitolite has been split into two ports: devel/gitolite for 3.x and
  devel/gitolite2 for 2.x

  gitolite 3.x is NOT "API" compatible with gitolite 2.x and requires
  additional manual migration steps which can be found in the online
  documentation.

  http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/install.html#migr

  Current users wishing to continue using gitolite 2.x should run:

  # portmaster -o devel/gitolite2 gitolite
    or
  # portupgrade -o devel/gitolite2 gitolite

20120430:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-google-api-python-client
  AUTHOR: nivit@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 1.0.b8. This new version has important
  changes which might break your code:

  * apiclient.anyjson has moved to oauth2client.anyjson.
  * Some calls, for example, taskqueue().lease() used to require
    a parameter named body. In this new release only methods that
    really need to send a body require a body parameter, and so
    you may get errors about an unknown 'body' parameter in your call.
    The solution is to remove the unneeded body={} parameter

  See http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/wiki/PyDoc for
  more information.

20120426:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/libreoffice

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix, mail/postfix2[6-8]
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  The latest update to these ports adds support to turn off
  the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.1.
  These protocols are known to cause inter-operability issues
  with certain services, e.g. hotmail.  If using TLS with Postfix,
  please consult the RELEASE_NOTES for information about possible
  workarounds.

  files based on the examples provided.

20120404:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/net-snmp
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  The net-snmp startup script now specifies a new pid_file to avoid a
  conflict that existed with bsnmpd.  As a result, the startup script
  cannot find currently running versions of snmpd.

  You will need to either stop the daemon before upgrading or locate the
  PID of snmpd and manually kill it after upgrade.  Then, start the daemon
  as you normally would.

20120326:
  AFFECTS: users of www/tomcat7

20120308:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8 and lang/perl5.10
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 and lang/perl5.10 have been removed since they've
  been EOL upstream for 3yrs and 2yrs respectively.  The default
  of lang/perl5.12 has not changed (yet).  Conditional checks for
  perl < 5.12 have been removed.  UNLESS you have PERL_VERSION=5.8.x
  or PERL_VERSION=5.10.x in /etc/make.conf you need take no action.
  If you do, you will have to recompile all perl dependant ports after
  updating your ports tree.  Please see entry 20110517 for help.

  # portmaster -w devel/pcre
    or
  # portupgrade devel/pcre

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: pgj@FreeBSD.org

  GHC has been updated to version 7.0.4, and Haskell Platform to version
  2011.4.0.0, and other Haskell ports are also updated to their Haskell
  Platform versions or latest versions.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  Postfix 2.9.0 contains several major changes, some of which could
  result in incompatible or unexpected behavior.  Regardless of the
  version from which you are upgrading, please carefully review the
  RELEASE_NOTES before proceeding.

20120126:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd and ftp/proftpd-mysql
  AUTHOR: Martin Matuska <mm@FreeBSD.org>

  The proftpd port has been updated to 1.3.4 and changed to use
  dynamically loadable modules. Please add corresponding LoadModule
  directives to your configuration file, like in the following example:

    LoadModule mod_tls.c

  The modules mod_sql_mysql and mod_sql_postgres are now outside of the
  main proftpd port:
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_mysql
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_postgres

  The proftpd-mysql port has been removed, use the alternative port:
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_mysql

20120121:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/vdr
  AUTHOR: Juergen Lock <nox@FreeBSD.org>

  The vdr ports have been updated to 1.7.22 which involves at least
  two changes:

  - svdrpsend.pl is now called svdrpsend.

  - The ttxtsubs channels.conf format has changed so if you use that
    plugin you need to edit /usr/local/etc/vdr/channels.conf for the
    channels you want to receive teletext subtitles on - see:

        /usr/local/share/doc/vdr-plugin-ttxtsubs/HISTORY

20120116:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  From the upstream RELEASE_NOTES:

  Instead of terminating immediately with a "fatal" message when a
  database file can't be opened, a Postfix daemon program now logs
  an "error" message, and continues execution with reduced
  functionality.

  Specify "daemon_table_open_error_is_fatal = yes" to get the
  historical behavior (immediate termination with "fatal" message).

  Logfile-based alerting systems may need to be updated to look for
  "error" messages in addition to "fatal" messages.

  By default the Postfix SMTP server no longer reports transcripts
  of sessions where a client command is rejected because a table is
  unavailable.  To receive such reports, add the new "data" class to
  the notify_classes parameter value. The reports will be sent to the
  error_notice_recipient address as before. This class is also used
  by the Postfix SMTP client to report about sessions that fail
  because a table is unavailable.

20120116:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xcb-util
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  x11/xcb-util was updated to 0.3.8 and was split in new modules.
  Dependencies were adjusted but main port symbols were moved to a single
  library, xcb-util.so.  For this reason, all dependent ports must be
  recompiled.If you use portmaster, run:

  # portmaster -R -r xcb-util-0

  Or for portupgrade:

  # portupgrade -r xcb-util-0\*

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.14
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.14 has been updated to 5.14.2.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.14.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.14 from lang/perl5.{8,10,12} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20110517 in this file.

20111205:
  AFFECTS: users of ruby-gnome ports
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  ruby-gnome has been updated to 1.0.3. Some of them have been removed
  since they are no longer included upstream. The meta port is
  now x11/ruby-gnome2. To update run the following command:

  # portmaster -o x11/ruby-gnome2 x11/ruby-gnome2-all

  You may also wish to remove the old ports using:

  # portmaster -s

20111130:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/nsd
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  The database format of nsd.db has changed as of version 3.2.9.

  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  The new versions of flpsed and dillo have switched from
  x11-toolkits/fltk2 to the new fltk 1.3.0 from x11-toolkits/fltk.
  Users who have customizations specific to fltk2 may need to consult
  the fltk 1.3 documents in order to adjust their local settings. For
  dillo, some commonly-used key bindings have changed, and new
  configuration options are available: consult dillorc.dist and
  keysrc.dist for details.

20111019:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/thunderbird or www/seamonkey with lightning
           plugin installed.
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  To get an up to date version of lightning you should use the new
  LIGHTNING option in mail/thunderbird or www/seamonkey. This option
  is not enabled by default so you have to run "make config" prior
  to the build. The old deskutils/lightning-thunderbird and
  deskutils/lightning ports should no longer be used and will be
  removed very soon.

  Like other XPIs ports, lightning now registers itself as a global
  extension and doesn't create the XPI to be installed manually.
  Upgrading users should remove lightning from their profile before
  installing Thunderbird or SeaMonkey the first time with the new
  LIGHTNING option enabled.

20111018:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  The default smtp_address_preference value is now "any" instead
  of "ipv6", meaning choose randomly between IPv6 and IPv4. With
  this the Postfix SMTP client will have more success delivering
  mail to sites that have problematic IPv6 configurations.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-subversion-freebsd
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  devel/p5-subversion-freebsd has been removed as it is no longer necessary.
  If you have it installed please run the following to switch to
  devel/p5-subversion:

  portmaster -o devel/p5-subversion p5-subversion-freebsd

  Please also see the second entry below (20111016) if haven't upgraded
  subversion yet.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC has been updated to 4.7.2. A number of files were moved between
  packages and several ports were split, thus manual intervention into
  update procedure is required:

  # pkg_delete -f raptor-1\* kdelibs-4\* kdebase-\*4\* \
    kdeaccessibility-4\* kdeedu-4\* kdegames-4\* kdegraphics-4\* \
    kdesdk-4\* kdeutils-4\* konq-plugins-4\* ktts\* nepomukcontroller\* \
    ruby\*-kdebindings\* kdebindings-smoke\*
  # pkg_delete -f kdehier4\*
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/etc/pam.d/* \
    /usr/local/etc/pam.d/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d/* \
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/services/* \
    /usr/local/share/dbus-1/services/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/system-services/* \
    /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system-services/
  # rmdir /usr/local/kde4/etc/pam.d /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d \
    /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/*services
  # rm -r /var/tmp/kdecache-*
  # portmaster misc/kdehier4

  If you have - or plan to install - net/kdenetwork4, also run:

  # portmaster -o net/linphone-base ortp

  Finally:

  # portmaster -a

  Also, remove /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d from local_startup in rc.conf(5).
  Failure to do this will cause all enabled scripts in /usr/local/etc/rc.d
  to be started twice.

  Remember to check for missing ports, bearing in mind that x11/kdebase4*
  ports were replaced by x11/kde4-* ones, ktts was replaced by jovie, while
  konq-plugins-kde4 and nepomukcontroller were removed. Then:

  # portmaster --check-depends

  You're also encouraged to run `pkg_cutleaves` or similar to check for
  orphaned ports.

  Please, note that `pkg_add -r kde4` will not install Plasma scriptengines
  and printer utilities by default anymore, and `pkg_add -r kdegames4` will
  not install Kajongg. This was made to avoid depending by default on
  kdebindings.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion, devel/subversion-freebsd,
           devel/p5-subversion, devel/py-subversion,

           all dependand ports.
  AUTHOR: Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>

  Subversion was updated to version 1.7.0 and port was reworked.

  Now there is no "devel/subversion-freebsd" port. All FreeBSD-specific patches
  are incorporated into main subversion port as options, which are turned ON by
  default.

  These options are:

  P4_STYLE_MARKERS -- change conflict markers to P4 style,
                      established for FreeBSD projects.
                      This is not mandatory for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  ENHANCED_KEYWORD -- Support for custom keywords, like
                      $ FreeBSD $ in sources.
                      This is MANDATORY for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  FREEBSD_TEMPLATE -- Standard FreeBSD commit template.
                      It is RECOMMENDED for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  Also, subversion 1.7.0 changes the working copy format,
  and a working copy can not be shared between
  subversion 1.7.0 and 1.6.x. Please, think twice before
  upgrading.

  Additional the port "devel/subversion16" was created to
  support subversion 1.6.x. Subversion 1.7.x and 1.6.x
  can not be installed simultaneously!

  Binding ports can be built with Subversion 1.7.0 (Default)
  or with Subversion 1.6.x. To build bindings with subversion 1.6.x
  you should set variable WITH_SUBVERSION_VER to "16".

  There are several ways to upgrade, depending on what you used
  before and what you want to get after upgrade.

  (a) You use devel/subversion without FreeBSD patches and, maybe,
      some bindings. You want fresh'n'new subversion 1.7.0.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion && make config
  <deselect first three options described above, if you want it>
  # portupgrade -r devel/subversion
    or
  # portmaster -R -r subversion-1.6

  (b) You use devel/subversion-freebsd and, maybe, some
      bindings. You want fresh'n'new subversion 1.7.0, again
      with FreeBSD patches.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion && make config
  <make sure that first three options are selected>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portupgrade -r devel/subversion
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portmaster -R -r subversion-1.7

  (c) You use devel/subversion without FreeBSD patches and, maybe,
      some bindings. You want good old subversion 1.6.x, again
      without again.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion16 && make config
  <deselect first three options described above, if you want it>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion
  # portupgrade -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -r devel/subversion16
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion
  # portmaster -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -R -r subversion-1.6

  (d) You use devel/subversion-freebsd and, maybe, some bindings.
      You want good old subversion 1.6.x, with FreeBSD patches.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion16 && make config
  <make sure, that first three options are selected>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portupgrade -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -r devel/subversion16
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portmaster -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -R -r subversion-1.6

20111005:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/erlang
  AUTHOR: Jimmy Olgeni <olgeni@FreeBSD.org>

  Following the R14B04 upgrade the JAVA, X11, WX and ODBC port
  options have been set to OFF by default; this will allow to replace
  lang/erlang-lite with lang/erlang for headless operation in the
  near future.

  If you need any of these options, run "make config" in lang/erlang
  before upgrading, or set your make.conf accordingly.

20111003:
  AFFECTS: users of math/qhull
  AUTHOR: Stephen Montgomery-Smith <stephen@FreeBSD.org>

  The port math/qhull has been moved to math/qhull5, and math/qhull has been
  updated to a version that is incompatible with all ports previously using
  math/qhull.  If you are upgrading a port that has math/qhull as a dependency,
  please delete the port math/qhull first, so that math/qhull5 is properly
  made as a dependency.

20110929:
  AFFECTS: users of net/py-zope.proxy, devel/py-zope.testing and
           devel/py-zope.interface
  AUTHOR: Ruslan Mahmatkhanov <cvs-src@yandex.ru>

  Several Zope ports have been renamed for consistency with their
  upstream distributions. Please run the following commands to update
  your local installations:

  If you use portmaster run:
  # portmaster -o devel/py-zope.interface devel/py-zopeInterface
  # portmaster -o net/py-zope.proxy net/py-zopeproxy
  # portmaster -o devel/py-zope.testing devel/py-zopetesting

  If you use portupgrade run:

  # portupgrade -o net/py-zope.proxy net/py-zopeproxy
  # portupgrade -o devel/py-zope.testing devel/py-zopetesting

20110928:
  AFFECTS: users of 10-current
  AUTHOR: eadler@FreeBSD.org

  There are known issues installing ports on FreeBSD 10+ due to
  bogus assumptions by various build scripts. This will not be fixed
  until 9-RELEASE is released.

  There are two workarounds:

  1) Set UNAME_r=9.9-CURRENT in your environment
  2) Set REVISION="9.9" in  ${SRCDIR}/sys/conf/newvers.sh

20110928:
  AFFECTS: users of www/nginx-devel
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  Note: 1.1.4 release introduces several API changes which may affect
  third-party modules.

20110925:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python*
  AUTHOR: lwhsu@FreeBSD.org

  The HUGE_STACK_SIZE option has been removed, now Python will use default
  thread stack size of the system.  If you want to change it, specify it
  with -DTHREAD_STACK_SIZE=<size> in CFLAGS.

20110925:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap*
  AUTHOR: ume@FreeBSD.org

  The security/cyrus-sasl2 was updated to 2.1.25.  If the SASL option
  is enabled (disabled by default), net/openldap* must be recompiled
  after upgrading cyrus-sasl2.

20110921:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/maven2 and devel/maven3
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/maven2 and devel/maven3 now rely on a wrapper port:
  devel/maven-wrapper. If you plan to upgrade the devel/maven[23] ports, you
  will have to uninstall all of them before reinstalling them.

20110917:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/tvbrowser
  AUTHOR: lme@FreeBSD.org

  From version 3.0.2 on TV-Browser doesn't include any plugins any longer. You
  are supposed to download the plugins manually, this also means that you need
  to download the appropriate channel sources plugin for your country. After
  installing it your previously configured channels are visible again. To do so,
  select "Tools -> Install / Update Plugins..." and choose the plugins you need.

20110915:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/unbound
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  unbound supports GOST from version 1.4.12 but only if dns/ldns was build
  with GOST support too. There is no way to check the option when unbound
  builds, so you should make sure the option is on in both unbound and lds.

20110914:
  AFFECTS: users of www/asterisk-stat
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  asterisk-stat depends on asterisk16 now, you will need to update asterisk
  and asterisk-addons to 1.6. Instructions on upgrading your configuration
  files are here:

  http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.6.2/UPGRADE-1.6.txt

  If you use portmaster run:
  # portmaster -o net/asterisk16 net/asterisk14
  # portmaster -o net/asterisk16-addons net/asterisk14-addons

  If you use portupgrade run:
  # portupgrade -o net/asterisk16 net/asterisk14
  # portupgrade -o net/asterisk16-addons net/asterisk14-addons

20110909:
  AFFECTS: users of net/p5-SOAP-Lite
  AUTHOR: az@FreeBSD.org

  SOAP::Transport::TCP is not a part of net/p5-SOAP-Lite
  distribution since version 0.714. If you need SOAP::Transport::TCP
  you should install net/p5-SOAP-Transport-TCP manually.

20110901:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db51
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/db51 port (Oracle Berkeley DB version 5.1) has been
  removed.  Version 5.2 of the package is available in databases/db5.
  Users of ports that depend on the removed 5.1 versions are advised
  to rebuild the affected ports.

20110830:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/racket
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  Racket has been upgraded to version 5.1.3. Due to the recent rewrite of
  the Racket graphics handling code, it is no longer possible to build
  this port without X11.

  The WITHOUT_X11 switch now controls if X11 is brought in as
  USE_GNOME/LIB_DEPENDS or BUILD_DEPENDS.

  In the latter case you will be able to build a Racket package that can
  then be deployed on a headless server.

20110829:
  AFFECTS: users of security/maia
  AUTHOR: Janky Jay, III <ek@purplehat.org>

  There have been many changes to the maia port, including renaming the rc
  script and variables from maia to maiad.  You will need to replace any
  instances of maia with maiad in /etc/rc.conf, as well as renaming /var/amavisd
  to /var/maiad.  The 'vscan' user's home directory also needs to be changed to
  /var/maiad.

  These can be done by:

  # mv /var/amavisd /var/maiad
  # sed -i.bak -e "s/^maia_/maiad_/" /etc/rc.conf
  # pw usermod vscan -d /var/maiad

20110828:
  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-{base,client,image}
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  During the update to 1.4.8, the GNUTLS option was changed from ON to
  OFF by default. Because old configuration options are saved, users
  should re-run 'make config' and explicitly deselect the GNUTLS option
  before upgrading.

20110823:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been reverted from 1.9 to 1.8. If you followed
  the procedure in the 20110822 entry, you may need to follow these steps:

  If you use portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby18 lang/ruby19
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-1.8

  If you use portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby19
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby18 # if you have it installed
  # portupgrade -f ports-mgmt/portupgrade
  # portupgrade -x ruby-1.9.\* -fr lang/ruby19

  If you wish to keep the 1.9 version as default, add the following lines
  to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 1.9 as default version.
  #
  RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.9

20110823:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libnotify and net/libproxy
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  libnotify and libproxy are updated with shared library bumps.
  This requires dependancies to be rebuild.

  # portmaster -o lang/ruby19 lang/ruby18
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-1.9

  If you use portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby18
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby19 # if you have it installed
  # portupgrade -f ports-mgmt/portupgrade
  # portupgrade -x ruby-1.8.\* -fr lang/ruby18

  After these steps are complete, you can pkg_delete ruby 1.8 if you
  no longer need it.

  If you wish to keep the 1.8 version as default, add the following lines
  to your /etc/make.conf file, and rebuild lang/ruby18 after that.

  #
  # Keep ruby 1.8 as default version.
  #
  RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.8

  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  Along with new features and bug fixes, amavisd-new 2.7.0 introduces some
  incompatibilities with previous releases.  Several variable defaults, SQL
  schemas, and other changes warrant a careful review of the RELEASE_NOTES.
  Also note that helper programs amavis.c and amavis-milter.c are no longer
  distributed with this package; for milter functionality, please shift to
  the dedicated security/amavisd-milter port.

  AFFECTS: users of java/openjdk6
  AUTHOR: jkim@FreeBSD.org

  java/openjdk6 has been updated to b23 and "WEB" option (for web browser
  plug-in and Java Web Start) has been deprecated. If you need the same
  functionality, rebuild the port with "ICEDTEA" option first, then install
  a new port java/icedtea-web with "PLUGIN" option (default). Also, if you
  have a symlink to the previous IcedTeaPlugin.so in ~/.mozilla/plugins,
  for example, you need to remove it. Note system-wide symlinks are now
  automatically created by java/icedtea-web for your convenience.

  AFFECTS: users of irc/ezbounce and irc/ezbounce-devel
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  irc/ezbounce-devel was moved to irc/ezbounce as the version previously in
  irc/ezbounce has been broken for some time and the distfile is not available
  anymore.

  If you are upgrading from a 1.0X version make sure to verify that your config
  still works. There is basic compatibility for old config files but a lot has
  changed, see http://linuxftw.com/ezbounce/files/CHANGES

  If you run irc/ezbounce-devel you need to run one of the following commands:

  # portmaster -o irc/ezbounce irc/ezbounce-devel
    or

20110618:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailscanner
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mailscanner no longer requires running of any renew-* targets to
  update the config files / wrapper scripts; it is now automatically
  performed as the port is installed -- these targets have been removed.

  As an added bonus, the binary package now performs these steps as well,
  in case you don't have a portstree handy.

  Before upgrading, please backup your PREFIX/etc/MailScanner,
  PREFIX/share/MailScanner and PREFIX/libexec/MailScanner if you
  have customised any of these directories, just in case.

20110607:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-Moose and devel/p5-Class-MOP
  AUTHOR: az@FreeBSD.org

  p5-Moose has been updated to 2.0007. Now p5-Class-MOP is a part of the
  p5-Moose distribution. Manual intervention of the update procedure is
  required:

    # portmaster -o devel/p5-Moose devel/p5-Class-MOP
    # portmaster -R -r p5-Moose-\*

  or do the same things with portupgrade.

  To check everything went fine you can run:
    # perl -Moose\ 999
  and
    # perl -MClass::MOP\ 999
  in both cases you should see output:
  version 999 required--this is only version 2.0007

20110606:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sympa
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Sympa previously used to install to ${PREFIX}/sympa, which goes against
  the general rules for hierarchy. Most files which were previously found
  in ${PREFIX}/sympa should now be found in ${PREFIX}/libexec/sympa.

  Any configuration in httpd.conf files etc will need to be updated to the
  new directory.

  Before upgrade, it is advisable to back up configuration files
  ${PREFIX}/etc/sympa.conf and wwsympa.conf since previous versions wipe these
  out on deinstall.

20110606:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The mariadb port has been split into -client, -scripts, and -server ports

  AUTHOR: nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net

  KMFL keyboard ports are now shared between IBus and SCIM KMFL IMEngines
  (textproc/ibus-kmfl and textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine). Thus, the prefix
  'scim-' is dropped from keyboard ports names.

  Similar to m17n, both engines now search engine-neutral locations,
  ${LOCALBASE}/share/kmfl/ and ~/.kmfl/. Users have to move their local
  keyboard files from ~/.scim/kmfl/ to ~/.kmfl/.

20110523:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_perl2
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  mod_perl2 was updated to version 2.0.5, this version includes

  # portmaster -R -r mod_perl2

20110522:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: vbox@FreeBSD.org

  The emulators/virtualbox-ose port has been updated to 4.0.8. If you
  want to stay with VirtualBox 3.2.x please run:

  # portmaster -o emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod-legacy emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.14 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.12, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.14):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.14 -f perl-5.12.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.14 lang/perl5.12

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20110516:
  AFFECTS: users of net/skype, net/skype-devel, net-im/skype, net-im/skype-devel
  AUTHOR: Ion-Mihai Tetcu <itetcu@FreeBSD.org>

  All skype ports were moved to net-im/:
  - skype12: unchanged, very old version (for FreeBSD 6)
  - skype20: last version with OSS support, that used to live in net/skype; the
  DISTFILE is gone from the vendor but if you happen to have it, it would be a
  way of having sound w/o needing to upgrade your base OS
  - [RECOMMENDED] skype: currently at 2.1.0.81 and the best supported
  - skype-devel: currently at 2.2.0.25, sounds is OK, video doesn't work

  To run either skype or skype-devel with fully working sound you need:
  - to run fc10 (most probably, please report what you can do with fc4):
  (OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f10,OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f10
  in /etc/make.conf for systems that doesn't have it as default)
  - In order for Skype to work OK, you need your kernel and modules to be:
	- post 2011-05-03 in on HEAD
	- post 2011-05-08 in on 7,8-STABLE
  The port tries to catch if your system version is too old, but there's a
  ~3months window where because of a lack of OSVERSION bump, this is not
  possible. So please check; and PLEASE READ THE PKGMESSAGE for setup details.
  For how to update your kernel/world, see:
  http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html

  IF YOUR OSVERSION IS NOT NEW ENOUGH, SOUND (ESPECIALLY MIC) WON'T WORK.

  If you run into problems, at very least we need to know the output of:
  $ uname -a; sysctl compat.linux | head -2; \
    grep OVERRIDE_LINUX_ /etc/make.conf; \
    cat /compat/linux/etc/alsa/pcm/pcm-oss.conf
  the skype version you are using and hardware details (eg. webcam, if related)
  I most probably will ignore any mail not containing this info since without
  it it's impossible to help.
  Please test your sound /video setup outside skype before blaming skype /
  mailing me.

20110516:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/musicpd
  AUTHOR: Chris Rees <utisoft@gmail.com>

  Musicpd now installs the binary for the server as bin/musicpd, rather than
  mpd, to remove a conflict with net/mpich2; before upgrade you should run:

  # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/musicpd stop

  Likewise, mpd.conf has been renamed musicpd.conf-- if you want to keep it
  as mpd.conf then place MPDCONF="mpd.conf" into /etc/make.conf, otherwise
  after upgrade run:

  # mv /usr/local/etc/mpd.conf /usr/local/etc/musicpd.conf

  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  Ocaml compiler and libraries suite has been updated to 3.12.
  There appears to be an ABI incompatibility with .cmi files
  generated by previous compiler versions.  Though these should
  only affect the linking process, if some application you're
  using start to misbehave after the lang/ocaml updated you're
  advised to rebuild this applications using the new ocaml version.

  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap24-client
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP has been upgraded to 2.4.25.  In this version, certain library
  routines were moved from liblutil to libldap.  If you previously built
  the library with "FETCH" support, this would cause libldap to depend on
  FreeBSD's libfetch.so library.


  As of 20110402, a local change have been introduced so OpenLDAP libraries
  link against libfetch.so when FETCH is enabled.  Normally, no further user
  interaction would be required.

  For new installations, the FETCH option have been turned off by default.

  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  The www/firefox port has been updated to 4.0. If you want to stay with
  Firefox 3.6 please run:

  # portupgrade -o www/firefox36 www/firefox
  # portupgrade -o www/firefox36-i18n www/firefox-i18n (if installed)
    or
  # portmaster -o www/firefox36 www/firefox
  # portmaster -o www/firefox36-i18n www/firefox-i18n (if installed)

  Do not select the OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS option on a system with less then
  2 GB of RAM otherwise you will run out of memory during the build.

  Please make sure all your addons are compatible with Firefox 4.0 and
  backup your ~/.mozilla directory prior to the first launch of Firefox
  4.0.

  The startup script has been renamed from firefox3 to firefox.

20110319:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-client
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The shared library version of the client library was increased to reflect
  ABI changes, and avoid compatibility problems with the client library
  in MySQL 5.1, so client programs that use the 5.5 client library should
  be recompiled against the 5.5.10 client library.
  This can be achieved with:

  # portmaster -r mysql-client-5.5
    or
  # portupgrade -fr mysql-client-5.5

20110318:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node and www/node-devel
  AUTHOR: araujo@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/node was merged with www/node-devel since there is no longer a
  development version. Also www/node has not followed the stable upstream
  prior to this update.

  To keep www/node updated in your applications, from now on you must use
  www/node instead of www/node-devel. If you have been using the www/node-devel,
  you must run one of the following commands to upgrade:

  # portmaster -o www/node www/node-devel
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node www/node-devel

20110317:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uzbl
  AUTHOR: Klaus Aehlig <aehlig@linta.de>

  The port has been updated to version as of 2011/02/15. This introduces
  the following incompatabilities.

  - $UZBL_FIFO, $UZBL_TITLE are available to scripts as environment variables,
  but not as command-line arguments.
  - environment variables are no longer expanded by the config parser
  - download handling has changed
  - cookie daemons are no longer supported

  Users are advised to change their personal configuration files/scripts accordingly.

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/duplicity
  AUTHOR: peter.schuller@infidyne.com

  sysutils/duplicity has been upgraded to 0.6.11. The old version
  (0.5.20) is retained as sysutils/duplicity05. Duplicity 0.6 should
  be generally compatible, but pay special attention to the new meaning
  of the --archive-dir command. In particular, the archive dir is now
  mandatory and defaults to ~/.cache/duplicity. You may have to
  --exclude accordingly.  In addition, it is recommended you consult
  the CHANGELOG, specifically the "New in v0.6.00 (2009/06/08)" section
  which details the checkpoint/restore feature (enabled by default) and
  its implications.

20110304:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python* and py-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Python has been changed from 2.6.x to 2.7.x.
  If you have 2.6.x installed, perform an upgrade of lang/python26 to
  lang/python27 with one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python27 lang/python26

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python27 lang/python26

  If you want to retain 2.6.x as default Python version, set the
  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION variable to 'python2.6' (without quotes) in
  /etc/make.conf, then go to lang/python and perform the following
  command:

  # portupgrade -R python

  Once the installed Python has been updated to 2.7, by using the
  method above, it is required to run the upgrade-site-packages target in
  lang/python to assure that site-packages are made available to the new
  Python version.

  If using portupgrade:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  If using portmaster:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages -DUSE_PORTMASTER

  The portmaster case can take quite some time to complete due to the lack of
  cached information that the portupgrade suite uses (specifically pkg_which).
  This is not the fault of portmaster.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/jasperserver
  AUTHOR: jhelfman@experts-exchange.com

  (taken from release notes of 4.0 from vendor)
  If you are upgrading from an older JasperServer version such as 3.5 then
  you must first upgrade to JasperServer 3.7 before upgrading to 4.0.
  Upgrading directly from JasperServer 3.5 to 4.0 is not a "certified"
  (i.e. fully QA tested) procedure.

  The steps to carry out this operation are fully documented in the
  JasperReports Server Installation Guide for the 3.7 release.  You will
  need to download the JasperServer 3.7 release package to get the relevant
  files and documentation. To download the JasperServer 3.7 WAR file
  distribution zip package, go to the JasperForge.org website and to the
  JasperServer project.

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.40, which uses a different wire
  protocol than 2.32 did.  In order to support synchronization with
  other computers where Unison is still at version 2.32, a new port
  net/unison232 has been created.  It provides unison232 and if that is
  GTK2-enabled, also unison232-text.  This unison232 port can be

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  Postfix 2.8 introduces minor incompatibilities with previous versions.
  Alias expansion, dns lookups, TLS support, milters and other features
  are affected.  To avoid surprises, carefully review the RELEASE_NOTES.

  If you upgrade from Postfix 2.6 or earlier, you must execute "postfix
  stop" and "postfix start" before you can use the postscreen(8) daemon.
  This is needed because the Postfix 2.6 "pass" master service type did
  not work reliably on some systems. If you upgrade from Postfix 2.7, or
  from Postfix 2.8 before July 25, 2010, you must "postfix reload" (or
  "postfix stop" followed by "postfix start"). This is needed because
  the queue manager to delivery agent protocol has changed.

  Also note that the optional SPF and VDA patches have not been updated
  for Postfix 2.8; as a result, they are currently disabled.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim
  AUTHOR: rea@FreeBSD.org

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] The default value for system_filter_user
  is now the Exim run-time user, instead of root.

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY is no longer
  optional and is forced on.  This is mitigated by the new build
  option TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST which defines a list of configuration
  files which are trusted; one per line. If a config file is owned
  by root and matches a pathname in the list, then it may be invoked
  by the Exim build-time user without Exim relinquishing root
  privileges.

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] The Exim user is no longer automatically
  trusted to supply -D<Macro[=Value]> overrides on the command-line.
  Going forward, we recommend using TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST with shim
  configs that include the main config.  As a transition mechanism,
  we are temporarily providing a work-around: the new build option
  WHITELIST_D_MACROS provides a colon-separated list of macro names
  which may be overriden by the Exim run-time user.  The values of
  these macros are constrained to the regex ^[A-Za-z0-9_/.-]*$
  (which explicitly does allow for empty values).

  Upgrading users are encouraged to fully study
    ftp://exim.inode.at/exim/ChangeLogs/NewStuff-4.73

  libksba has been updated to 1.1.0, and the shared library version has
  increased from .17 to .18.

  Directly- and indirectly-dependent ports have had their PORTREVISION
  bumped to facilitate rebuilding.  Please rebuild the dependent ports
  with your preferred upgrading tool:

	# portupgrade -rf security/libksba
  -or-
	# portmaster -w -r security/libksba

  If there are still ports on your system that require ksba.so.17 (either
  in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg, or non-existent), _please_ file a PR so
  that a correct direct dependency can be added.

  Once you are satisfied that no ports still depend on the old shared
  library version (libksba.so.17), you can safely delete it from the
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg directory if it is present there.

  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  The next stage in the ongoing cleanup of autotools-using ports is
  a refactoring of bsd.autotools.mk so that version numbers are no longer
  needed within the USE_AUTOTOOLS stanza.  There is either
  autoconf213/autoconf or automake14/automake (for the legacy versions,

  the amount of tree-wide patching in future on an update.

  IMPORTANT: if you have either devel/autoconf-wrapper or

  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  As of Postfix 2.7.2, 2.6.8, 2.5.11:

  Postfix no longer automatically appends the system default CA
  (certificate authority) certificates, when it reads the CA
  certificates specified with {smtp, lmtp, smtpd}_tls_CAfile or
  with {smtp, lmtp, smtpd}_tls_CApath.  This prevents third-party
  certificates from getting mail relay permission with the
  permit_tls_all_clientcerts feature.  Unfortunately, this change
  may cause compatibility problems with configurations that rely

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-server
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  If you are upgrading from a previous MySQL release, the server will exit
  during startup after finding that the proxies_priv table is missing.
  To create the table, start the server with the --skip-grant-tables
  option to cause it to skip the normal grant table checks, then run
  mysql_upgrade. Then stop the server and restart it normally.
  You can do this by temporarly setting the following line in rc.conf:

  mysql_args="--skip-grant-tables --skip-networking"

20101108:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/py-bsddb3
  AUTHOR: wen@FreeBSD.org

  py-bsddb3 update to 5.1.0. This release drops support for Berkeley
  DB 4.1, and adds support for Berkeley DB version 5.1, brand new. If
  you need Berkeley DB 4.1 support, keep using pybsddb 5.0.0. If you
  want support for Berkeley DB 5.1, remember to install the BDB library
  before installing these bindings.

20101030:
  AFFECTS: users of www/xshttpd-devel
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  The default XS-httpd configuration file locations have changed:
  The main configuration file is now $PREFIX/etc/xshttpd/httpd.conf
  and other configuration file are stored in that same directory.
  Existing configurations should be moved over manually.
  Log files now appear in /var/log/xshttpd/ by default.

20101029:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster
  AUTHOR: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org>

  The changes to bsd.port.mk in 1.652 require all portmaster users to
  upgrade to version 3.1 or later.  The best method to do this will be
  to use the port, rather than portmaster itself:

  # pkg_delete -f portmaster\*
  # cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster && make clean && make install clean

20101026:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba35
  AUTHOR: Timur Bakeyev <timur@FreeBSD.org>

  This is the latest stable release of the Samba3 distribution. It has
  been extended with the experimental support of the NFS4-like ACLs on
  ZFS partitions, thanks to the sysutils/libsunacl library by Edward
  Tomasz Napierala(trasz). This support haven't been tested thoroughly,
  so try it on your own risk.

  This port reverted back to the pre- net/samba34 layout of the
  directories and now they are again $PREFIX/etc/samba, /var/run/samba,
  /var/log/samba, /var/db/samba and /var/spool/samba respectively.

  In case, you are upgrading from net/samba34, please rename
  corresponding samba34/ subdirectories into samba/ ones. Upgrades from
  older versions of Samba and fresh installations should be seamless.

20101015:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/llvm-devel who use clang
  AUTHOR: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

  The clang portion of devel/llvm-devel has been split out and now
  resides in lang/clang-devel.  If you have devel/llvm-devel installed
  in order to use clang, you will need to install the clang-devel port
  when upgrading.

20101003:
  AFFECTS: users of www/typo3
  AUTHOR: Helmut Schneider <jumper99@gmx.de>

  www/typo3 has been repocopied to www/typo343. If you need to continue with
  the old stable version please run

  # portmaster -o www/typo343 www/typo3
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/typo343 www/typo3

  Please remember to change the path of your config files too.

20101003:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/kismet
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  This update includes major changes in how Kismet works and is configured.
  Clients, servers, drones, and configuration files must be updated to work
  with the new version.  Map support has not yet been added.

  See the kismet README for details.

20100929:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zfsnap
  AUTHOR: Aldis Berjoza <aldis@bsdroot.lv>

  Since timestamp format changed you need to use -o option with -d
  option in order to be able to delete old snapshots. Note however that
  you don't need -o when creating new snapshots, unless you want to keep
  using the old timestamp format.

  See http://wiki.bsdroot.lv/zfsnap for more info.

20100927:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  Incompatibility with snapshot 20100912
  ======================================
  - If your DNSBL queries have a "secret" in the domain name, you must
    now censor this information from the postscreen(8) SMTP replies.
  - The postscreen "continue" action is now called "ignore". The old
    name is still supported but no longer documented.
  - The postscreen_hangup_action parameter was removed. Postscreen
    now always behaves as if "postscreen_hangup_action = drop".
  - The postscreen_cache_retention_time default was increased from
    1d to 7d, to avoid deleting results from expensive deep SMTP
    protocol tests too quickly.

  Incompatibility with snapshot 20100827
  ======================================
  - The Postfix SMTP client no longer appends the local domain when
    looking up a DNS name without ".".
    Specify "smtp_dns_resolver_options  = res_defnames" to get the old
    behavior, which may produce unexpected results.

20100924:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  nvidia-driver does not install vdpau library and headers anymore, they
  are now provided by multimedia/libvdpau port. To avoid conflict, please
  rebuild nvidia-driver port before upgrading your ports and before
  installing multimedia/libvdpau.

20100921:
  AFFECTS: users of p5-Compress-Zlib, p5-IO-Compress-*
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The p5-Compress-Zlib, p5-IO-Compress-Base, p5-IO-Compress-Zlib and
  p5-IO-Compress-Bzip2 ports have been replaced by p5-IO-Compress.
  Users of Perl 5.10 and higher do not need to install this module
  because it is already included in the standard perl distribution.

20100920:
  AFFECTS: users of security/stunnel
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  In stunnel-4.34, the DH support is no longer configurable by the user,
  but always enabled when OpenSSL supports it instead.  This means that
  it will now most probably be enabled on the supported versions of FreeBSD.
  If this leads to problems with old SSL clients, I will look into making
  it configurable at build time again.

20100917:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk
  AUTHOR: marius@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/cdrtools-cjk port has been removed, as the required functionality is
  now available in cdrtools 3.0.0 in the standard sysutils/cdrtools port.

 20100915:
  AFFECTS: autoconf, automake
  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  autoconf has been updated from 2.62 to 2.67 -- all ports depending on
  autoconf-2.62 have had their PORTREVISIONs update, so a standard
  port updating method will suffice.

  USE_GETTEXT has been extended to also accept 'build' and 'run' for
  ports which need devel/gettext as a BUILD- or RUN-time dependency only.
  No port should now be directly depending on devel/gettext in Makefiles.

20100915:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk
  AUTHOR: marius@FreeBSD.org

  Version 3.00 of sysutils/cdrtools breaks but at the same time also
  obsoletes sysutils/cdrtools-cjk as mkisofs now employs iconv for
  character conversion. Consequently sysutils/cdrtools-cjk is marked
  BROKEN and the use of USE_CDRTOOLS=cjk as well as USE_CDRTOOLS together
  with the WITH_CJK knob left in a broken state until bsd.port.mk is
  updated by portmgr@ accordingly. Once USE_CDRTOOLS is updated to no
  longer refer to sysutils/cdrtools-cjk the latter will be removed.
  Previous users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk should switch to using
  sysutils/cdrtools instead, which might require not using the WITH_CJK
  knob until said update of bsd.port.mk has happened.

20100915:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been updated to 5.12.2.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.12.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.12 from lang/perl5.{8,10} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20100715 in this file.

20100912:
  AFFECTS: ftp/curl
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  With version 7.21.1, the cURL port is built with stricter compiler
  checking by default (the -Werror flag is passed to the C compiler,
  making it treat any warnings as fatal errors).  If you experience
  problems building cURL, re-run "make config" in the ftp/curl
  directory and disable the WERROR knob.

20100912:
  AFFECTS: www/tdiary-devel, japanese/tdiary-devel
  AUTHOR: tota@FreeBSD.org

  The stable tDiary ports, www/tdiary and japanese/tdiary, have been
  updated to 3.0.0. The development versions of tDiary have been merged
  from www/tdiary-devel to www/tdiary and from japanese/tdiary-devel to
  japanese/tdiary, respectively.

  If you have been using the www/tdiary-devel or japanese/tdiary-devel,
  you run one of the following commands to upgrade:

  - www/tdiary-devel
	# portmaster -o www/tdiary www/tdiary-devel
	or
	# portupgrade -o www/tdiary www/tdiary-devel

  - japanese/tdiary-devel
	# portmaster -o japanese/tdiary japanese/tdiary-devel
	or
	# portupgrade -o japanese/tdiary japanese/tdiary-devel

  Before upgrading, please read the following for more details:

20100907:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/pecl-fileinfo
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  If you are using php 5.3 (lang/php5) and fileinfo extension, you
  should switch to sysutils/php5-fileinfo port:

	portmaster -o sysutils/php5-fileinfo sysutils/pecl-fileinfo

20100904:
  AFFECTS: net/netcat
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Rename nc to netcat to prevent /usr/bin/nc shadowing /usr/local/bin/nc

20100902:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports has been updated to 4.5.1. A number of files were moved
  between packages, manual intervention into update procedure is required:

  # pkg_delete -f kdehier4\* kdelibs-4\* kdebase-4\* kdebase-runtime-4\* kdebase-workspace-4\*
  # rm -rf /usr/local/kde4/share/PolicyKit/policy
  # cd /usr/ports/misc/kdehier4 && make install clean
  # portmaster -a

20100901:
  AFFECTS: users of www/rubygem-rails
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Rails has been updated to 3.0.0.  As always, make sure you check the
  changes at http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/.

20100817:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The modules mod_geoip and mod_h264_streaming have been moved into slave
  ports: www/lighttpd-mod_geoip and www/lighttpd-mod_h264_streaming

20100818:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The default lighttpd configuration file locations have changed.
  The main configuration file is now: $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
  and includes other configuration files from $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/

  For compatibility with old-style configurations, if the lighttpd_conf
  variable is not set in /etc/rc.conf, $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd.conf takes
  precedence over $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

20100815:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis and databases/redis-devel
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The redis configuration file, redis.conf, have been changed, some options
  removed in newer versions (>=2.0).  In some cases, redis-server with
  older configuration might does not run at startup.

  If you run into startup problems, re-edit configuration file.

20100813:
  AFFECTS: www/opera
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  If you run opera without gtk or kde4, the browser might crash on shutdown.
  In this case go to about:config and change "Dialog Toolkit" from 0 to 4.

20100811:
  AFFECTS: multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2, which is not maintained upstream, has been
  replaced with new port, multimedia/mp4v2. The shared library version
  has been changed with this update, thus all ports that depends on
  mp4v2 library must be rebuilt:

	portmaster -o multimedia/mp4v2 multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2
	portmaster -a

20100731:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/ccache
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  Users upgrading from 2.4 release should clear the old cache directory with:

        # ccache --clear

20100730:
  AFFECTS: users of www/neon28 and www/neon29
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Makes neon29 our default neon library in the ports tree. The www/neon28
  has been removed and www/neon29's shared library version has been changed.
  You will have to rebuild all ports that depend on www/neon29. Do this:

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o www/neon29 www/neon28
	portmaster -r neon29-

  Portupgrade user:
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o www/neon29 -f neon28-\*
	pkgdb -Ff
	portupgrade -rf neon29-\*

20100728:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/nltk
  AUTHOR: clsung@FreeBSD.org

  Nltk has been upgraded to 2.0b8 which depends on devel/py-yaml now.
  You need to deinstall nltk before upgrading, since the previous port
  will delete files installed from py-yaml during its deinstall phase.

  Use, for example:

    # pkg_delete nltk-2.0b7,1
    # portsnap fetch update
    # cd /usr/ports/textproc/nltk/
    # make install clean

20100727:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libgcrypt
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  libgcrypt has been upgraded to 1.4.6 which has a shared library version
  bump.  You need to reinstall all ports that depend on it.  Use something
  like this:

	portupgrade -rf libgcrypt
	portmaster -r libgcrypt

20100722:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: Phillip <pneumann@gmail.com>

  The database schema and the format in which persistent messages are
  stored have both changed since the last release (1.7.2). When
  starting, the RabbitMQ server will detect the existence of an old
  database and will move it to a backup location, before creating a
  fresh, empty database, and will log a warning.

20100715:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.10, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.12):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.12 -f perl-5.10.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.12 lang/perl5.10

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches  more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20100626:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/ibus-mozc
  AUTHOR: daichi@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/ibus-mozc port has been updated to version 0.11.383.102,
  and separated into 5 ports to cope with upcoming new port
  japanese/scim-mozc.

    o japanese/mozc-server
    o japanese/mozc-tool
    o japanese/mozc-additions
    o japanese/ibus-mozc
    o devel/py-gyp-devel

  You can not upgrade with portupgrade or portmaster. To upgrade, you
  must deinstall japanese/ibus-mozc first and then install the new
  japanese/ibus-mozc.

  For example:

    # pkg_delete ja-ibus-mozc-0.11.365.102_1
    # portsnap fetch update
    # cd /usr/ports/japanese/ibus-mozc/
    # make install clean

20100617:
  AFFECTS: users of security/{dirmngr|gnupg}
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The security/libassuan port has been updated to version 2.0.0, and
  the applications listed above have been updated to use it as of versions
  1.1.0 and 2.0.15 respectively.  If you HAVE NOT updated your libassuan
  port as described in the 20100613 entry, you can simply update all 3
  ports together (libassuan, dirmngr if installed, and gnupg) using your
  normal upgrade path.  If you HAVE updated to libassuan-1, then you need
  to do the following before upgrading dirmngr and gnupg.

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o security/libassuan security/libassuan-1

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o security/libassuan libassuan-1

  If you use neither:

	pkg_delete -f libassuan*

  Please note, libassuan version 2.0.0 is now a shared library, so unlike
  the previous version it is now a runtime dependency and cannot be deleted
  after you are done building dirmngr and/or gnupg.

20100613:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kdepim4, and  security/{gpa|opensc}
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The security/libassuan port has been updated to version 2.0.0, however,
  the applications listed above are not yet compatible with it.  Therefore
  security/libassuan-1 has been created until they can be updated, and the
  ports listed above have been updated to depend on it.  You must first
  replace your existing libassuan with version 1 in the new location, then
  you can update the ports listed above normally.

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o security/libassuan-1 security/libassuan

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o security/libassuan-1 libassuan

  If you use neither:

	pkg_delete -f libassuan*

20100609:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/libogg and audio/libao
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  There are new versions of libogg (1.2.0) and libao (1.0.0) and the
  shared library versions have been bumped (ogg.6 to ogg.7, ao.3 to ao.4).

  All ports that have an identifiable direct dependency on these libraries
  have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.  However, some ports that pull in
  the libraries indirectly may continue to look for the old versions.  To
  ensure that all are updated, perform this step:

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -rf libogg libao

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -r libogg libao

20100605:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/gstreamer-plugins-good and
	   multimedia/gstreamer-plugins-bad
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  Certain plugins were moved from the -bad port to the -good port.  Please
  follow instructions below before proceeding with normal update steps:

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster gstreamer-plugins-bad

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -R multimedia/gstreamer-plugins-bad

20100602:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/mono
  AUTHOR: romain@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with Mono 2.6, the Moonlight compiler and assemblies are not
  installed by the lang/mono port anymore.  They are however provided by
  the multimedia/moonlight port.

  If you are doing some Silverlight development, install multimedia/moonlight
  after updating lang/mono.

20100530:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  Another version of gettext (0.18), and another shared library version
  bump (from intl.8 to intl.9), so:

  All ports that have an identifiable known direct dependency on gettext
  have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.  If after upgrading:

	# portupgrade -rf gettext
	# portmaster -w -r gettext

  The upgrade of devel/gobject-introspection may fail because it is looking
  for libintl.so.8.  In this case, do the following:

	# cd /usr/ports/devel/gobject-introspection
	# make clean
	# make deinstall
	# make install clean

  Then continue your upgrade procedure normally.

  If there are still ports on your system that are looking for libintl.so.8
  (either in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg, or non-existent), _please_ file
  a PR so that a correct direct dependency can be added.

  Once you are satisfied that no ports still depend on the old versions (such
  as libgettextpo.so.4 and libintl.so.8) you can safely delete them from the
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg directory if they are present there.

20100524:

	   x11/xmobar, x11-wm/xmonad, x11-wm/xmonad-contrib
  AUTHOR: pgj@FreeBSD.org

  The following ports have been renamed to improve consistency among Haskell
  Cabal ports:

    - devel/darcs           -> devel/hs-darcs
    - ports-mgmt/porte      -> ports-mgmt/hs-porte
    - textproc/pandoc       -> textproc/hs-pandoc
    - x11/xmobar            -> x11/hs-xmobar

    - x11-wm/xmonad-contrib -> x11-wm/hs-xmonad-contrib

  Please follow these steps below to update Haskell ports that you have
  installed:

  1) Reinstall the renamed Haskell port dependencies (see previous entry).
     Note that this will possibly require that you remove the affected leaf
     (aforementioned) ports as well;

  2) Reinstall the renamed application(s) you use.

20100524:
  AFFECTS: users of hs-* ports
  AUTHOR: pgj@FreeBSD.org

  2) Rebuild the renamed ports and all ports that depend on them.

20100518:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/pylint
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The pylint user configuration files have been changed slightly in newer
  versions (>=0.20.0).  In some cases, older configurations might crash
  pylint at startup.

  If you run into startup problems, make sure you remove the .pylintrc
  configuration settings and the .pylint.d directory from your home
  directory:

	$ rm ~/.pylintrc
	$ rm -rf ~/.pylint.d

20100518:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr0, devel/apr1, www/apache20, www/apache22
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  devel/apr port has been renamed to devel/apr1.

  WITH_APR_FROM_PORTS=yes for www/apache22 has been dissolved and may be
  removed from your configuration files; devel/apr1 is always used now.

  Please manually delete apache-2.\* if installed _before_ updating using
  either portmaster or portupgrade:

	pkg_delete -f apache-2.\*

  Then, if you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o devel/apr1 devel/apr

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o devel/apr1 devel/apr

  Finally, reinstall Apache port if you deleted it earlier and update ports as
  usual (`XX' below is either 20 or 22):

	portinstall www/apacheXX

20100512:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache20
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  The rc.d script has been renamed:

	apache2.sh -> apache2

  You'll need to update any crons wrappers, etc. for the new paths.

  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated from 4.3.5 to 4.4.3. A number of libraries
  was moved between packages. The recommended update procedure is to delete
  kdelibs-experimental*, kdebase-4*, kdebase-workspace-4*,
  kdebase-runtime-4*, kdepim-4*, kdepim-runtime-4*, and then update ports as
  usual and install desired KDE 4 ports:

    # pkg_delete -f kdebase-\*4\* kdepim-\*4\* kdelibs-experimental-\*4\*
    # portmaster -a (or portupgrade -aR)

  In order to enabled Nepomuk semantic desktop search you have to install
  databases/virtuoso (you don't need to manually configure or run virtuoso
  server).

20100511:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/redland RDF engine
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Redland RDF engine has been split into redland itself and rasqal engine.
  The recommended update procedure is to delete redland, then update ports
  as usual and install desired RDF ports:

	   multimedia/phonon, and multimedia/phonon-gstreamer
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  WITH_QT_PHONON global knob has been introduced to allow selection between
  multimedia/qt4-phonon* ports (a bit outdated Phonon, which is shipped with
  Qt 4) and multimedia/phonon* ports.  Since KDE SC 4.4 now requires fresh
  Phonon, multimedia/phonon* ports are installed by default.

  If you don't use KDE, you may set WITH_QT_PHONON=yes in /etc/make.conf
  and continue to use Qt 4 Phonon implementation ports.

  If you want to use KDE SC 4.4 (or if you want the latest Phonon), do not
  define WITH_QT_PHONON, delete multimedia/qt4-phonon* ports, and install
  multimedia/phonon*:

  If you use portmaster:

    portmaster -o multimedia/phonon multimedia/qt4-phonon
    portmaster -o multimedia/phonon-gstreamer multimedia/qt4-phonon-gst

  If you use portupgrade:

    portupgrade -f -o multimedia/phonon multimedia/qt4-phonon

  AFFECTS: users of mail/nullmailer on FreeBSD 6.X
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The nullmailer port was recently updated with an rc.d script to correctly
  daemonize nullmailer-send with daemon(8).  On FreeBSD 6.X, daemon(8) does
  not support "[-u user]" command-line switch, causing the nullmailer rc.d
  script failure to start nullmailer-send.

  Support for "[-u user]" command-line switch was recently MFC'd to 6-STABLE
 (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=bin/146266).  FreeBSD 6.X users
  should patch and install daemon(8) by one of the methods described below.

  If /usr/src is not yet populated, csup the 6-STABLE sources and run these
  commands:

    cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/daemon
    make install
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nullmailer start

  If /usr/src is already populated with sources from a previous 6.X release,
  use these commands:

    cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/daemon
    fetch 'http://people.freebsd.org/~glarkin/pr-links/daemon/patch-daemon.c'
    fetch 'http://people.freebsd.org/~glarkin/pr-links/daemon/patch-daemon.8'
    patch -p0 daemon.c < patch-daemon.c
    patch -p0 daemon.8 < patch-daemon.8
    make install
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nullmailer start

  AFFECTS: users of www/squid*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with squid* the directory containing the default cache and log
  directory was changed from $PREFIX/squid/ to /var/squid/.

  The default values for the following Squid configuration parameters have
  changed as shown below:

  cache_log from $PREFIX/squid/logs/cache.log to /var/squid/logs/cache.log
  cache_store_log from $PREFIX/squid/logs/store.log to /var/squid/logs/store.log
  pid_filename from $PREFIX/squid/logs/squid.pid to /var/squid/logs/squid.pid
  coredump_dir from $PREFIX/squid/cache to /var/squid/cache

  Please check whether you need to define any of these variables in your
  squid.conf to the old defaults explicitly before updating, especially if
  you have set up automated log processing or automated log rotation.  If you
  define pid_filename in your squid.conf, you should also set squid_pidfile
  to the same value in /etc/rc.conf, cf. $PREFIX/etc/rc.d/squid.

  AFFECTS: users of math/libgmp4
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default gmp version in FreeBSD is now 5.0.x.  The port directory
  changed from math/libgmp4 to math/gmp.  An entry has been added to MOVED
  and all depending ports revisions have been bumped, so the update should
  be handled correctly by usual port management tools such as portupgrade.

  Portmaster users, please do the following before upgrading ports that
  depend on gmp:

	portmaster -o math/gmp math/libgmp4

  AFFECTS: users of net/dgd
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The kernel library has been separated from the main net/dgd port into its
  own net/dgd-kernel port so that all libraries are on an equal footing.
  This also reflects the split of the kernel library out from the main DGD
  distribution.

  If you wish to continue to use the kernel library you'll need to install
  net/dgd-kernel after updating to dgd-1.4.1_2.

  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox
  AUTHORS: beat@FreeBSD.org, mandree@FreeBSD.org (Java plugin)

  The www/firefox port has been updated to 3.6.  From now on www/firefox
  will contain the most recent version of Firefox.  Older but still
  supported releases will be available in www/firefox3 and www/firefox35.

  In order to update to Firefox 3.6 please delete your older installed
  version of Firefox first and install www/firefox afterwards.  Please
  make sure all your addons are compatible with Firefox 3.6 and backup
  your ~/.mozilla directory prior to the first launch of Firefox 3.6.

  Note that in order to use Java with Firefox 3.6, you need to install
  java/openjdk6, build it with the "WEB" option enabled and use the Iced
  Tea plugin.  To achieve the latter, each user needs to create a
  symlink to the Icedtea plugin as described in the Browsers/Firefox and
  Java[tm] Plugin section in the handbook:

	ln -s /usr/local/openjdk6/jre/lib/IcedTeaPlugin.so \
	$HOME/.mozilla/plugins

  AFFECTS: users of Mesa3D libraries and x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  If you want to use Mesa3D 7.6.1 and libdrm 2.4.17 rather than 7.4.4
  and 2.4.12, you must define WITHOUT_NOUVEAU global macro, at least,
  enabled on graphics/libGL*, graphics/libglut, graphics/dri,
  graphics/mesa-demos, and graphics/libdrm.  And please give up using
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau.

  At this time, I cannot enable latest Mesa3D and libdrm, because they
  break xf86-video-nouveau.  But old (current?) Mesa3D and libdrm do not
  break any drivers.

  AMD Radeon HD 2xxx/3xxx/4xxx users: If you use AMD Radeon HD [234]xxx
  series, please define WITHOUT_NOUVEAU global macro.  You can then use
  OpenGL Hardware Accelerator feature on these series.

20100206:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4-devel
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Default configuration file was moved to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/smb4.conf to
  avoid conflicts with the installed net/samba3?.  Also, userland utils
  are not installed by default, which should also help with the parallel
  setup of Samba3 and Samba4.

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 3 and KDE 3
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  When building qt33 and kdelibs3 (at least), while they are installed,
  because of -L/usr/local/lib being passed too soon, the currently installed
  libraries are used instead of the ones from the build.  This makes the
  build fail if you updated any of the libraries these Qt/KDE libraries are
  linked against (e.g. libjpeg).

  For the moment the workaround, when you get to this, is to move the old lib
  out of the way, e.g.:

    mv /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so.old && \
    cd /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/qt33/ && make && \
    mv /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so.old /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so && \
    portmaster -C x11-toolkits/qt33 (or portupgrade -w qt-33\*) ...

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba34
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  This port was developed with the generous help of Florent Brodin.

  The default passdb backend has been changed to `tdbsam'! That breaks
  existing setups using the `smbpasswd' backend without explicit
  declaration! Please use `passdb backend = smbpasswd' if you would like
  to stick to the `smbpasswd' backend or convert your smbpasswd entries
  using e.g. `pdbedit -i smbpasswd -e tdbsam'.

  The `tdbsam' backend is much more flexible concerning per user
  settings like `profile path' or `home directory' and there are some
  commands which do not work with the `smbpasswd' backend at all.

20100130:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/sdl_mixer and graphics/sdl_image
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The SDL_mixer and SDL_image libraries have new shared library versions.
  Please rebuild all ports that depend on them.

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -r sdl_mixer-
	portmaster -r sdl_image-

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -fr audio/sdl_mixer
	portupgrade -fr graphics/sdl_image

20100125:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/openal and graphics/openal-soft
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The default OpenAL implementation was switched to audio/openal-soft.
  To update all ports correctly, the following steps have to be performed.

	pkg_delete -f openal-\*

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o audio/openal-soft audio/openal
	portmaster -r audio/openal-soft

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -ro audio/openal audio/openal-soft

  If you want to stick with audio/openal, please specify the following ports
  make flag within /etc/make.conf (or an appropriate configuration file for
  your ports):

	WANT_OPENAL=si

20100122:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/policykit and sysutils/polkit
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Due to a recent change in sysutils/policykit, both sysutils/policykit,
  and sysutils/polkit need to be rebuilt, but in a certain order.  First,
  upgrade sysutils/policykit to 0.9_6.  Then, force rebuild and reinstall
  of sysutils/polkit.  If you do not do this, applications which depend
  on polkitd will fail.

20100113:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  Port has been renamed to emulators/virtualbox-ose to reflect that we are
  using the OSE version.  A separate port for the kernel modules has been
  created: emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod.

  Please see http://wiki.freebsd.org/VirtualBox for update instructions.

20100107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  security/openvpn has been moved to security/openvpn20 and upgraded to 2.0.9.
  security/openvpn has been upgraded to 2.1.1, and security/openvpn-devel has
  been removed.

  Regular upgrades of the security/openvpn port should succeed without
  manual intervention, but if you want to stick to openvpn 2.0 or if you
  had been using openvpn-devel, manual intervention is needed, as
  follows:

  If you'd been using the security/openvpn-devel port, please use one of
  these commands for upgrading:

    portmaster -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn security/openvpn-devel

    portupgrade -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn security/openvpn-devel

  If you want to stick to openvpn 2.0, please use one of these two
  upgrade commands:

    portmaster -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn20 security/openvpn

    portupgrade -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn20 security/openvpn

20100106:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/websvn
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default install directory for websvn has changed from
  ${PREFIX}/www/data/websvn to ${PREFIX}/www/websvn.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your settings
  and data, please do the following:

	mv /usr/local/www/data/websvn /usr/local/www

  Then update as usual.

20091227:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/grok
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  The sysutils/grok port has been completely re-written. Configuration files

  be made to work with the new version.

20091226:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/ndoutils
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading you'll need to run ./upgradedb; see UPGRADING file.

20091214:
  AFFECTS: users of net/grdc
  AUTHOR: avl@FreeBSD.org

  Grdc has been renamed to Remmina upstream, and the port was also renamed
  to reflect this.  After installing remmina port you will need to download
  the ``grdc2remmina.sh'' script and run it as your normal user(s) that
  have ~/.grdc.  The script will only create ~/.remmina directory and move
  grdc config files to the new path; it does not affect anything else.

	$ fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~avl/script/grdc2remmina.sh
	$ sh grdc2remmina.sh

20091213:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/zabbix, net-mgmt/zabbix-agent
  AUTHOR: Jim Riggs <ports@christianserving.org>

  In order to simplify configuration and better separate the different
  components of Zabbix, the former zabbix port has been split into three:
  zabbix-server, zabbix-proxy, and zabbix-frontend.  Each component has
  distinct functionality and may be installed independently on separate
  systems.  The existing zabbix-agent port remains.

  Additionally, the new zabbix-frontend port now (correctly) installs the
  PHP frontend in PREFIX/www/zabbix.  The old zabbix port installed the
  files in PREFIX/share/zabbix/php.  Web server configurations must be
  updated accordingly.

  Finally, Zabbix has been updated to version 1.8.  Not everyone may be
  able to upgrade from version 1.6 immediately, though, so 1.6.8 versions
  of the ports are also available as zabbix16-server, zabbix16-proxy,
  zabbix16-agent, and zabbix16-frontend.

20091206:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 0.11.1, which no longer enables kqemu by
  default (if built with KQEMU knob on), now you also have to explicitly
  pass -enable-kqemu (or -kernel-kqemu as with the previous versions)
  if you want to use it.  Also note the 0.11 stable branch is the last
  qemu branch that still supports kqemu, so if you depend on reasonably
  fast emulation on FreeBSD you should start looking for alternatives
  some time soon.  (VirtualBox?)

20091120:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfixadmin
  AUTHOR: Terry Sposato <tabmow@freenode.net>

  Due to a bug in the previous postfixadmin port, existing users need to
  backup their config.inc.php before they upgrade to postfixadmin-2.3 or
  later and put it in place after the upgrade is complete.

20091120:
  AFFECTS: users of security/f-prot
  AUTHOR: Tim Bishop <tdb@FreeBSD.org>

  The main f-prot command is now named fpscan.  Virus definitions are
  updated using the fpupdate command.  fpupdate will automatically run
  from periodic every day.  To disable set the following option in
  /etc/periodic.conf:

	fpupdate_enable="NO"

  The f-prot port now only works on i386.

20091118:
  AFFECTS: users of java/jboss5
  AUTHOR: Jonathan Chen <jonc@chen.org.nz>

  The JBoss directory structure has been reorganised to follow hier(7)
  guidelines more closely; in particular, transient and deployment files
  were moved to /var/jboss5, thus allowing /usr to be read-only.

20091118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/redmine
  AUTHOR: Bernhard Froehlich <decke@bluelife.at>

  After the upgrade you need to generate a session secret before restarting
  the application.  This is to protect you from cross-site request forgery.
  From your Redmine directory, simply run the following command once:

	# rake config/initializers/session_store.rb

  then upgrade as usual:

	# rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

20091114:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/win4bsd
  AUTHOR: Mario S F Ferreira <lioux@FreeBSD.org>

  The new port now depends on emulators/kqemu-kmod instead of installing
  its own version.  Therefore, you should make sure that no other kqemu.ko
  modules are installed:

	# pkg_delete -f win4bsd\*
  	# rm -f /boot/kernel/kqemu.ko
  	# pkg_delete -f kqemu-kmod\*
  	# portinstall emulators/win4bsd

  Do not forget to enable kqemu on rc.conf since win4bsd will not work
  without it.

20091018:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql54-server
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  After the upgrade the server may fail to start due to changes in the
  default values of innodb_log_files_in_group and innodb_log_file_size,
  which differ from those in earlier 5.4 releases.

  You should discard the old InnoDB log files and let MySQL 5.4.3 create
  new ones.  It is necessary to shut down your current server cleanly so
  that no outstanding transaction information remains in the log.

  See here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.4/en/news-5-4-3.html

20091014:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/heirloom-mailx
  AUTHOR: Alexander Logvinov <avl@FreeBSD.org>

  Since SourceForge switched to the new File Release System,
  mail/heirloom-mailx has wrong package name.  All users who have
  mail/heirloom-mailx installed after 22 August 2009 should run the
  following commands:

	# pkg_delete "\-mailx-12.4_1"
  or
	# rm -r /var/db/pkg/-mailx-12.4_1

	# rm -r /var/db/ports/-mailx

  AFFECTS: users of archivers/lzmautils, archivers/lzmautils-devel
  AUTHOR: Christian Weisgerber <naddy@FreeBSD.org>

  The XZ Utils distribution has superseded LZMA Utils, so the xz port has
  been added and the lzmautils ports have been removed.  To perform the
  move, run one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:

	# portupgrade -o archivers/xz lzmautils\*

  If using portmaster:

	# portmaster -o archivers/xz archivers/lzmautils
  or
	# portmaster -o archivers/xz archivers/lzmautils-devel

  as applicable.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-postfwd
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@tandon.net>

  The recipient rate-limiting feature is now called via rcpt() command

  AFFECTS: users of www/epiphany, x11/yelp, graphics/librsvg2,
	   x11/toolkits/py-gnome-extras, and www/epiphany-extensions
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The default Gecko provider has been changed from www/firefox to
  www/libxul.  Firefox 2.x is now marked FORBIDDEN for security reasons,
  and libxul is new, stable, and preferred Gecko provider.  Libxul uses
  the same Gecko engine as Firefox 3.0.x.

  Some ports may fail to upgrade or run when both www/firefox and libxul
  are installed on the same system.  To make sure everything runs smoothly,
  uninstall www/firefox, then install libxul, then upgrade the affected
  ports.

20090915:

  AUTHOR: Denis Shaposhnikov <dsh@wizard.volgograd.ru>

  Please read the following:

    https://oss.gonicus.de/labs/gosa/wiki/DocumentationInstallingUpdatingGOsa

  before upgrading this port.  And don't forget to check your slapd.conf
  because gosa scheme files were changed.  Should you have any problems
  during LDAP migration step, try to restart your PHP process.

20090911:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.10
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.10 has been updated to 5.10.1.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.10.  Please see its
  manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.10 from lang/perl5.8 please follow
  instructions in the entry 20090328 in this file.

  AFFECTS: users of gstreamer-plugins-bad gstreamer-plugins-good
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  Due to the move of several plugins from gstreamer-plugins-bad to
  gstreamer-plugins-good, it is necessary to update gstreamer-plugins-bad
  first:

	portupgrade -R gstreamer-plugins-bad

  The port emulators/linux-systemsimcell has been updated to 3.1.25.
  Systemsimcell emulator now has a new dependency: x11-toolkits/linux-f10-blt.
  So you need to switch to linux-f10 ports in order to use 3.1.25 version.

  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  GnuTLS has been updated to 2.8.3 and all shared libraries versions have
  been bumped.  So you need to rebuild all applications that depend on
  gnutls.  Do something like:

	portupgrade -rf gnutls

  AFFECTS: users of astro/celestia and KDE
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  Celestia can now be compiled with KDE 3 frontend (you can enable it with
  CELESTIA_UI=kde when building).  It is very feature-rich, as it offers
  contextual menus, toolbars, KDE integration, internationalization,
  bookmarks, etc.  If you use Celestia and KDE as your desktop, you might
  want to rebuild the port so it integrates into your environment better.

20090815:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  Dovecot has been updated to version 1.2.3.  The configuration file has
  changed significantly.  Please see http://wiki.dovecot.org/Upgrading/1.2
  for details of what this means.

20090804:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon*, x11/kdebase4*, deskutils/kdepim4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE 4 has been updated to version 4.3.0.  KDE now uses qt4-phonon;
  multimedia/phonon and multimedia/phonon-gstreamer are deprecated in
  favor of their qt4 equivalents.  You can still use multimedia/phonon-xine
  however.  A number of files have been moved between packages.  The
  recommended update procedure is to delete phonon, phonon-gstreamer,
  kdebase-*4*, kdepim-4*, then update ports as usual and install desired
  KDE 4 ports:

    # pkg_delete -f phonon-4\* phonon-gstreamer\* kdebase-\*4\* kdepim-4\*
    # portmaster -a (or portupgrade -a)
    # cd ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde4 && make config && make install clean

20090804:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/dbus-qt4, devel/qt4-designer
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Qt 4 ports have been updated to 4.5.2.  The recommended update procedure
  is to delete qt4-dbus and qt4-designer, then update ports as usual.
  Install qt4-designer if needed.

20090802:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libtool15 and devel/libltdl15
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/libtool15 and devel/libltdl15 ports have been moved to libtool22
  and libltdl22, respectively, then updated to 2.2.6a. You will need to run
  portmaster or portupgrade to properly perform the upgrade:

  If using portmaster:

	portmaster -o devel/libtool22 devel/libtool15
	portmaster -o devel/libltdl22 devel/libltdl15

  If using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o devel/libtool22 libtool-1.5\*
	portupgrade -o devel/libltdl22 libltdl-1.5\*

  After that, you will need to rebuild all ports that depend on libltdl.
  Since all dependent ports' PORTREVISIONs have been bumped, you can run
  portupgrade or portmaster with `-a' option to complete the upgrade.

20090801:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  An updated libdrm and xf86-video-nouveau have been committed.  These

  multimedia/mlt.

20090613:
  AFFECTS: users of www/hudson
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  Hudson is now running as a standalone process and no longer relies on
  Apache Tomcat.  As such, it should now be configured by defining
  hudson_* variables in rc.conf.  See comments from rc.d script for further
  details.

  The default setup is using the same port numbers and HTTP URL prefix as
  before in order to reduce the effort of upgrading the port.  Hence, it
  may conflict with some running Apache Tomcat instance.  To fix this
  problem, you may either deinstall www/tomcat6, or use the following
  settings in hudson_args from /etc/rc.conf:

    --httpPort=??? --ajp13Port=???

20090611:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Two rc.d scripts have been renamed:

	apache22.sh -> apache22
	htcacheclean.sh -> htcacheclean

  You'll need to update any crons wrappers, etc. for the new paths.

20090608:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python* and py-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Python has been changed from 2.5.x to 2.6.x.
  If you have 2.5.x installed, perform an upgrade of lang/python25 to
  lang/python26 with one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python26 lang/python25

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python26 lang/python25

  If you want to retain 2.5.x as default Python version, set the
  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION variable to 'python2.5' (without quotes) in
  /etc/make.conf, then go to lang/python and perform the following
  command:

  # portupgrade -R python

  Once the installed Python has been updated to 2.6, by using the
  method above, it is required to run the upgrade-site-packages target in
  lang/python to assure that site-packages are made available to the new
  Python version.

  If using portupgrade:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  If using portmaster:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages -DUSE_PORTMASTER

  The portmaster case can take quite some time to complete due to the lack of
  cached information that the portupgrade suite uses (specifically pkg_which).
  This is not the fault of portmaster.

20090606:
  AFFECTS: users of java/eclipse
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The update to 3.4.2 changes the location of the metadata for eclipse to
  be more in line with what is used on other platforms.  This means that
  after the update plugins that have been installed by a user with the
  built in Update Manager will need to be reinstalled.

20090605:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  Version 2.6.1 introduced a POLA violation by expecting aliases.db to be
  in /etc/mail/aliases.db (not /etc/aliases.db).  With this version the
  location is reverted to the right place.

  If you updated your installation to 2.6.1 you need to run newaliases(1)
  again after you installed 2.6.2.

20090603:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/font-mplus-ipa (and old japanese/ipa-ttfonts)
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  IPAUIGothic has been updated to a version included in IPA font
  version 002.03 and added as a separated port
  "japanese/font-ipa-uigothic".  And the font-mplus-ipa has been
  updated to remove the old IPAUIGothic.

  Thus the old ipa-ttfonts is almost equivalent to font-ipa +
  font-ipa-uigothic + font-mplus-ipa.  Note that these three packages
  have different licenses from each other.

20090601:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/cvs-devel
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  cvs-devel no longer installs /bin/cvs and /bin/cvsbug. These are now

  of this change with respect to your path.

20090531:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/viewvc
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  viewvc.conf and templates are not compatible to 1.0.x version, even the
  database scripts have changed.  For details see:

  http://viewvc.tigris.org/source/browse/*checkout*/viewvc/trunk/docs/upgrading-howto.html

20090530:
  AFFECTS: users of Japanese and Chinese fonts
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Ports for Japanese fonts have been reorganized in the following way:

	japanese/ipa-ttfonts -> japanese/font-mplus-ipa
	japanese/ipa-ttfonts -> japanese/font-ipa
	japanese/kochi-ttfonts -> japanese/font-kochi
	japanese/mplusfonts -> japanese/font-mplus
	japanese/sazanami-ttf -> japanese/font-sazanami
	japanese/shinonome -> japanese/font-shinonome
	japanese/umefont -> japanese/font-ume
	japanese/vlgothic -> japanese/font-vlgothic

  While basically these are port name changes for consistency,
  installation directories are also changed:

	font files -> ${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}/*
	symlinks -> ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/{TTF,OTF,fontname,...}/*
	symlinks -> ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/{TTF,OTF,misc,fontname,...}/*

  A user-visible one is that the directory name "TrueType" is replaced
  with "TTF".

  Also, japanese/font-std and chinese/font-std have been added as
  standard fonts used in the Ports Collection.  Currently they
  contain:

	std.ja_JP/Mincho
	std.ja_JP/Gothic
	std.ja_JP/Ryumin-Light
	std.ja_JP/GothicBBB-Medium
	std.zh_CN/STHeiti-Regular
	std.zh_CN/STSong-Light
	std.zh_CN/MSung-Light
	std.zh_CN/MHei-Medium

  under ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/.  They are just symlinks to
  corresponding font files.  The symlink names are based on popular
  PostScript font names.

  Applications should refer the font files via XLFD or fontconfig
  first.  If they need a direct reference to the font file, please use
  files in std.*/*.  This is because direct reference to a specific
  font name in an application configuration file makes the maintenance
  difficult when the font file name is changed, for example.

20090516:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/viewvc
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  OPTION APACHE2 has been changed to APACHE (WITH_APACHE)
  WITH_APACHE2 is deprecated and is being removed.
  APACHE_PORT will be pulled in when WITH_APACHE is selected

20090516:
  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-base and portupgrade
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The print/cups port has been split into multiple ports.  If upgrading

  provided with the port before restarting bacula.

20090410:
  AFFECTS: users of www/trac-email2trac
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  bin/email2trac.py and bin/delete_spam.py are now installed without the
  .py extension to make the suid run_email2trac work and match the online
  documentation.  If you were using them in scripts or alias entries, you
  will need to update paths accordingly.

20090401:
  AFFECTS: users of Fedora 8 Linux infrastructure ports
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  ATTENTION! Those ports are not default for any version of FreeBSD for now
  and may be used with FreeBSD versions 7.2 and above (8-CURRENT is better)
  using compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 and linux_base-f8. Please, note that
  2.6.16 is not fully supported on 7.x (ex., some syscalls are missing
  and cannot be MFCed due to a native FreeBSD ABI breakage).

  For more information about transition please read item "20070327: AFFECTS:
  users of emulators/linux_base-fc6". That note may be used for upgrading
  to linux_base-f8 and Fedora 8 Linux infrastructure ports as well.

  If you want to switch to linux-f8 ports, please define at /etc/make.conf:

	OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f8
	OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f8

20090328:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.10 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.8, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.10):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.10 -f perl-5.8.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portmaster -o lang/perl5.10 lang/perl5.8
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches  more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20090327:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  After version 0.95 clamav-milter does not accept parameters by command
  line.  If you are using $clamav_milter_flags on rc.conf to set its
  parameters you will need to move to new ${PREFIX}/etc/clamav-milter.conf.

20090319:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash3
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  With the addition of shells/bash version 4.x, people wanting to stick
  with bash 3.x should perform the following update:

	$ portupgrade -f -o shells/bash3 bash

20090318:
  AFFECTS: users of www/suphp
  AUTHOR: yzlin@cs.nctu.edu.tw

  The suPHP port has been upgraded to 0.7.x. This new version of suPHP has
  some new features and changes for the configuration file:

    - Multiple path (with patterns) & variable substitution support for
      docroots
    - Double-quoted strings at section '[handlers]'
      ex. application/x-httpd-php="php:/usr/local/bin/php-cgi"

  These changes may lead to internal server error if without modifications
  of the configuration file from previous version.

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of www/geeklog
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  To follow the standards this port has received a small reworking.

  WWW_DIR (that defaulted to PREFIX/www/data/geeklog) is deprecated,
  use WWWDIR (defaults to PREFIX/www/geeklog).

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: skylord@linkline.ru

  ejabberd's UID and GID have changed (PR ports/105122). Users are advised
  to check all configuration files and data in /var/spool/ejabberd to
  ensure everything has the correct owner/group.

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/lire
  AUTHOR: edwin@FreeBSD.org

  Lire now requires DBD::SQLite, which uses SQLite 3.0.  This means that the
  Lire database format has changed.  If you have one or more old Lire stores,
  you will need to convert each of them from SQLite2 format to SQLite3 like
  this:

	$ sqlite oldstore.db .dump | sqlite3 newstore.db

  This assumes that you have both SQLite2 and SQLite3 installed on your
  system, and that the names of the command line interface for the old and
  new version are `sqlite' and `sqlite3' respectively (this is at least
  correct for Fedora).

20090310:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mythtv
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The upgrade from version 0.20 to version 0.21 should be transparent.
  Any changes to the database structure should be applied automatically.

  However, it is strongly recommended that you back up your database before
  installing a new version of MythTV.

  For example:

	$ mysqldump -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -c > mythtv_backup.sql

  To restore (assuming that you've dropped the database):

	$ mysql -u root
	mysql>create database mythconverg;
	mysql>exit
	$ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < mythtv_backup.sql

20090309:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libusb on CURRENT
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  FreeBSD libusb20 was renamed to libusb in r189585 and thus, being fully
  compatible with libusb20, replaces devel/libusb on HEAD.  devel/libusb
  should not be used on these systems.  Users of libusb-dependent ports
  are advised to remove libusb package from their systems, and rebuild all
  libusb dependencies.  One of the possible ways to achieve this is
  listed below:

	# set tempfile=`mktemp /tmp/usbports.XX`
	# pkg_info -qR /var/db/pkg/libusb-* > ${tempfile}
	# pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/libusb-*
	# cat ${tempfile} | xargs portupgrade -f
	# rm -f ${tempfile}

20090309:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/phonon port has been split into phonon itself, phonon-xine,
  and phonon-gstreamer backends.  After updating phonon port you have
  to install at least one backend; phonon-xine backend is recommended
  for KDE.

20090308:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 0.10.0, which now uses the newer
  (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade emulators/qemu
  with the KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20090304:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/py-gammu
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  The port comms/py-gammu was incorporated into comms/gammu since
  1.23.0. Delete comms/py-gammu first and then deinstall/reinstall
  comms/gammu with option WITH_PYTHON_GAMMU=YES.

20090304:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xfce4
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading from Xfce 4.4 to 4.6 make sure you uninstall the following
  ports:

	x11/libxfce4mcs
	sysutils/xfce4-mcs-manager
	sysutils/xfce4-mcs-plugins
	x11-themes/xfce4-icon-theme

  You may uninstall them before you start the upgrade procedure (preferred)
  or even afterwards when the upgrade went fine.

  Please also note that Xfce 4.6 does not come with an icon theme any more.
  Xfce 4.6 now depends on the Tango theme which is now installed by default.
  The default installation of Xfce is also adjusted to use this icon theme
  instead of the Xfce 4.4 standard Rodent theme.  If you are upgrading from
  Xfce 4.4 to 4.6 you probably still have the Rodent theme selected.  This
  will lead to several "missing" icons when starting up Xfce.

  Make sure to switch as well to the Tango theme.  To do this just open the
  Settings Manager and select Appearance.  Inside the Appearance dialog
  switch to the Icons tab and select the "Tango" entry in the list on the
  left side of the Icons tab.

  For enabling the Reboot/Shutdown functionality of Xfce's logout dialog
  please read the note which gets printed out after the installation of
  x11-wm/xfce4 about how to configure PolicyKit.

20090223:
  AFFECTS: users of Tcl/Tk
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Tcl/Tk has been changed from 8.4 to 8.5.

  To restore old behavior and prefer using Tcl 8.4 with supported ports set
  WITH_TCL_VER=84 in /etc/make.conf. This has no effect on ports that have
  USE_TCL=yes or USE_TK=yes. They stick to the new default version and have
  to be updated by their maintainers to support other versions than default.

20090218:
  AFFECTS: users of www/zend-framework
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was fixed in Zend Framework
  1.7.5. The LFI was present in the Zend_View::render() method, and
  allowed inclusion of scripts with relative path names, e.g.
  "../../../my/script/dir/myscript.php".

  If the script path name is hard-coded into the application and is not
  generated by user input, the vulnerability does not apply.  Because of
  this exception, the Zend Framework team has added a flag to disable
  the LFI protection in the render() method.

  Full details of the vulnerability, whether it applies to your
  application and how to disable the LFI protection in the render()
  method can be found here:

  KDE 4 has been updated from 4.1.4 to 4.2.0.  A number of applications
  have been moved between packages.  The easiest way to avoid various
  problems during update is to delete all KDE-4.1.4 ports and install
  KDE-4.2.0:

	# pkg_delete -f kde\*4.1.4\* automoc4-\*
	# portmaster -a (or portupgrade -a)
	# cd ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde4 && make config && make install clean

  AFFECTS: users of devel/libslang and devel/libslang2
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  devel/libslang has been removed in favor of devel/libslang2 after not
  being released during last five years.  WITH_SLANG2 is no longer a
  valid ports KNOB.  All ports that depend on devel/libslang should be
  recompiled, e.g.:

	# portupgrade -o devel/libslang2 devel/libslang

  AFFECTS: users of www/httptunnel
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  The startup script has been converted to new rc.d style and split
  into two scripts: htc (client) and hts (server). Please check the scripts
  for how to set variables in /etc/rc.conf.

  AFFECTS: users of gstreamer-plugins
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The gstapp library moved from the gstreamer-plugins-bad package to
  gstreamer-plugins.  It will be necessary to rebuild the gstreamer-plugins
  port.  After updating your installed ports please do (if you are using
  portupgrade):

	# portupgrade -f gstreamer-plugins

20090127:
  AFFECTS: users of www/xpi-deepestsender
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/xpi-deepestsender has been updated to version 0.9.0.  This version
  is *only* for Firefox version 3.x.

20090124:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server, sysutils/hal
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/hal has been updated and should now properly detect mice for
  in X.Org.  Use of AllowEmptyInput should no longer be needed for most
  users and moused should now work fine.

20090123:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  If you are using an older xorg.conf several config lines are no longer
  needed and will generate warnings when X is started.  RgbPath will cause
  X to fail to start, remove it from your config.

  Server 1.5.3 also really wants to configure its input devices via hald.
  This is causing some issues with moused and /dev/sysmouse.  There are
  couple of options for how to deal with it:

  1. Add Option "AllowEmptyInput" "off" to your ServerLayout section.
     This will cause X to use the configured kbd, mouse, and vmmouse
     sections from your xorg.conf

  2. Don't use moused.  If you want it to work with addon USB mice
     set this in rc.conf:

	moused_enable="NO"
	moused_nondefault_enable="NO"

  I'm working on fixing hald or the mouse driver or both.

20090123:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/libxcb
  AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  Libxcb shared library version was bumped from 1 to 2.  You need to
  rebuild any consumer of libxcb.so.1 or some applications will be
  linked against two versions of libxcb once libX11 is upgraded.

  For portupgrade users:

	# portupgrade -rf libxcb

20090121:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/linux-glib2, emulation/linux_base-f4
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  Glib2 now is incorporated to emulation/linux_base-fc4 (it has always
  been a part of more recent Linux base ports). All users should deinstall
  devel/linux-glib2 and then deinstall/reinstall emulation/linux_base-f4.

20090119:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/claws-mail, mail/claws-mail-smime
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The claws-mail port includes the S/MIME plugin itself now, it is not
  distributed as a separate plugin anymore. It can be enabled with the
  GPGME option in the port (disabled by default). If you use the S/MIME
  plugin, you should remove the mail/claws-mail-smime port before
  enabling GPGME and updating the mail/claws-mail port. People which
  already updated mail/claws-mail with GPGME enabled and a non-working
  S/MIME plugin need to deinstall mail/claws-mail-smime and reinstall
  mail/claws-mail.

20090118:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Deluge has been updated from 0.5.x to 1.x. The 1.x has been rewritten,
  so it is recommend for you to make the back up of your ~/.config/deluge. The
  configuration and plugins of 0.5.x do not work in 1.x. Deluge will picking
  up the old configuration and try to convert it to the newer format, but I
  wouldn't trust it to do it without the back up.

  If you prefer to stick with 0.5.x, you can use portmaster:

  	# portmaster -o net-p2p/deluge05 net-p2p/deluge

  or if you use portupgrade:

	# portupgrade -o net-p2p/deluge05 net-p2p/deluge

20090118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  IkiWiki has been upgraded from 2.x to 3.x.  Instructions for
  migrating existing IkiWiki configurations to 3.x format can be found
  at http://ikiwiki.info/tips/upgrade_to_3.0/.

20090118:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr-svn devel/apr
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  devel/apr-svn has been removed and devel/apr now handles its role.
  devel/apr now defaults to building with Berkeley database support (bdb)
  APR_UTIL_* tunables have been renamed to comply with ports/KNOBS names.

20090114:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase4-workspace, x11/kdebase4-runtime
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE 4 has been updated from 4.1.1 to 4.1.4.  A number of files have been
  moved between packages.  You should deinstall kdebase4-runtime package
  before updating:

	pkg_delete -f kdebase-runtime-4.1\*
	portmaster -a

  After successful update you could install kdebase4-runtime if it has not
  been installed during update process.

20090114:
  AFFECTS: users of GNOME and GTK+
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.24.x.  You have to deinstall a few ports
  first before using portupgrade or portmaster in order to successfully
  upgrade your GNOME installation.  After successful upgrade, you have
  to reinstall gnome-session so the gnome.desktop session file is properly
  installed.

  Portupgrade users:

	# pkgdb -Ff
	(Answer "yes" to unregister gail while keeping gtk20.)
	(Answer "yes" to unregister fast-user-switch-applet while
	 keeping gdm.)

	# pkg_deinstall -fO gtkmm-2.12\*
	# portupgrade -aOW
	# portupgrade -f gnome-session

  Portmaster users:

	# pkg_delete -f gtkmm-2.12\*
	# portmaster -a
	# portmaster gnome-session

20090113:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 has been updated to 5.8.9.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  perl-after-upgrade script supplied with lang/perl5.8.  Please see its
  manual page for details.

20090112:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/claws-mail*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  claws-mail has been updated to 3.7.0, with this update OpenSSL support
  has been removed by upstream in favour of GnuTLS.  GnuTLS is now enabled
  by default.  Themes were have also been split to an extra port which
  your can find under x11-themes/claws-mail-themes.  Menu was rewritten
  entirely in version 3.6.0 using modern GTK interface; as a consequence,
  all your custom shortcuts will be lost after upgrade.

20090109:
  AFFECTS: users of any Mozilla and Opera products
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Java plugins now will no longer be picked up by automatically from
  these browsers.  Because all Java ports share the name of plugins file,
  I am thinking about someone or maybe me will need to write something
  similar to nspluginwrapper (but in shell script) that can add Java plugin
  in ~/.*/plugins/ when user requests one specific version of Java plugin
  if this user has more than one version of Java installed.  However, for
  now, you will have to add Java plugin in ~/.*/plugins/ manually.

20090107:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/unixODBC
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/unixODBC port has been updated to 2.2.14.  While
  containing many bug fixes and minor feature adjustments, this version
  no longer ships with the (obsolete) MySQL ODBC driver.  MySQL ODBC
  driver users will probably want to use databases/mysql-connector-odbc
  instead.  The text-backed/flatfile driver (libtxtodbc) has also been
  removed by the developers but due to some demand may make a return in
  a future version or as a separate port.

20090107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libgcrypt
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  libgcrypt has been upgraded to 1.4.3 which has a shared library version
  bump.  You need to reinstall all ports that depend on it.  Use something
  like this:

	portupgrade -rf libgcrypt
	portmaster -r libgcrypt

20090104:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap24-{client,server}
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP has been upgraded to 2.4.13, which requires a shared library
  version bump.  Therefore, you need to reinstall all ports  that depend on
  it.  Please do something like:

	# portupgrade -fr net/openldap24-client

20081230:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: pneumann@gmail.com

  The database schema has changed between RabbitMQ-1.4.0 and this release.
  When the RabbitMQ server detects the presence of an old database, it
  moves it to a backup location, creates a fresh, empty database, and
  logs a warning.

20081226:
  AFFECTS: users of www/rt38
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/rt38 now respects the FreeBSD directory layout, see hier(7).
  With this change, p5-RT-* and p5-RTx-* should be much simpler to use
  in the ports collection.

  Please note that www/p5-RTx-Shredder is included in www/rt38.  This
  port will be deprecated and removed.

20081228:
  AFFECTS: users of astro/boinc-setiathome-enhanced
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  The setiathome client has been updated to version 6.03 and version 5.00
  of the astropulse client has been added.  Before you update, finish and
  report your current workunits to avoid losing them.  The port now also
  includes the client screensavers.

20081228:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/kinput2
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The Wnn backend of japanese/kinput2 port now uses unix domain socket
  to communicate the server by default.  If $JSERVER environment
  variable is defined, the value is used as the server host name.  In
  In short, the server name is determined in the following way:

  $JSERVER --(if null)--> CcWnn.Jserver --(if null)--> "localhost"

  If the server host name is null or matches "^unix$", unix domain
  socket is used.  Note that the default server name in CcWnn.Jserver
  is "unix" now.

20081226:
  AFFECTS: users of www/rt*
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/rt2 www/rt3 www/rt32 www/rt34 are now deprecated and will expire
  2009-02-01.  All ports now depend on www/rt38 If you can not update
  to www/rt38, www/rt36 is still around.

20081224:
  AFFECTS: users of www/phpSysInfo
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The www/phpSysInfo port has been split into www/phpsysinfo and
  www/phpsysinfo-dev ports.

20081217:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/policyd2
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  The RC script for mail/policyd2 has been renamed to avoid a conflict.
  If you use this port please change the setting in rc.conf to be
  policyd2_enable.

20081211:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5
  AUTHOR: pav@FreeBSD.org, itetcu@FreeBSD.org, ale@FreeBSD.org

  As of PHP 5.2.7, pcre extension is distributed with the core PHP5 package,
  and not as a standalone module anymore.  Follow the steps below to update
  your installation.

  Portupgrade users:

	pkg_delete -f php5-pcre-5.2.6
	pkgdb -F
	portupgrade as usual

  Portmaster users:

	pkg_delete -f php5-pcre\*
	portmaster php5

  If you are using pecl ports you might need to force an update on them:

	portupgrade -f pecl\*
  or
	portmaster pecl

  If you have the pecl hash, json and/or zip extensions you need to replace
  them with the PHP5 bundled ones, e.g.:

	portmaster/portupgrade -o archivers/php5-zip archivers/pecl-zip
	portmaster/portupgrade -o devel/php5-json devel/pecl-json
	portmaster/portupgrade -o security/php5-hash security/pecl-hash

  If you build your INDEX locally and you tried to build it after the PHP
  update commit, you need to rebuild it _after_ you updated lang/php5:

	cd /usr/ports && make index

  or (if you use ports-mgmt/p5-FreeBSD-Portindex):

	cd /usr/ports && cache-init && portindex -o `make -V INDEXFILE`

20081207:
  AFFECTS: users of games/mkgichessclub
  AUTHOR: nivit@FreeBSD.org

  After the update to the version 2.2.0, please, alter the SQL tables
  with the command:

	mysql _mkgichessclub_ < /usr/local/share/mkgichessclub/db_migrate_2.1_to_2.2.sql

  where _mkgichessclub_ is the database name chosen during the installation
  of the port.

20081205:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/ktorrent
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  ktorrent has been updated to 3.1.5 for KDE 4. The last release of ktorrent
  for KDE 3 is available under net-p2p/ktorrent2.

20081121:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/smstools3
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The startup script of comms/smstools3 has changed. For increased security
  smstools now runs as user uucp / group dialer by default. The script
  commands like sendsms etc. should be executed as user uucp.
  To restore the old behaviour, set smsd_user="root" and smsd_group="wheel"
  in your /etc/rc.conf.

  Hint: use security/sudo for running smsd scripts as user uucp.

20081108:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/tamago
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The Wnn backend of editors/tamago port now uses unix domain socket
  to communicate the server by default.  If $[CJKT]SERVER environment
  variable is defined, the value is used as the server host name.  In
  JSERVER case, for example, the server name is determined in the
  following way:

	$JSERVER --(if null)--> wnn-jserver --(if null)--> "unix"

  If the server host name is null or matches "^unix$", unix domain
  socket is used.  The path name of the socket can be specified in
  wnn-[cjkt]udpath custom variable.

  migrate. It's strongly advised to backup your blog before updating.

20081102:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  The location of git-shell has changed to
  ${PREFIX}/libexec/git-core/git-shell.  Please remove the old entry from
  /etc/shells.

20081030:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/FreeWnn-server
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The jserver daemon in japanese/FreeWnn-server port now uses "127.0.0.1"
  as the default listen address for security reason.  If you need
  the wildcard address (INADDR_ANY), you have to explicitly set
  "listenaddr" to 0.0.0.0 in ${PREFIX}/lib/wnn/ja_JP/jserverrc or
  add "-a 0.0.0.0" to ${wnn_flags} in /etc/rc.conf.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of www/asterisk-gui
  AUTHOR: pneumann@gmail.com

  The upgrade to version 2.0 will modify your asterisk dialplan when login
  to the page. Hardware autodetection will not work, pending update of
  misc/zaptel.

20081028:
  AFFECTS: users of www/codeigniter
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  For certain installations, the following steps should be performed
  after the CodeIgniter 1.7.0 upgrade (taken from:
  http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/upgrade_170.html).

  >>> Update your Session Table

  If you are using the Session class in your application, AND if you
  are storing session data to a database, you must add a new column
  named user_data to your session table. Here is an example of what
  this column might look like for MySQL:

	user_data text NOT NULL

  To add this column you will run a query similar to this:

	ALTER TABLE `ci_sessions` ADD `user_data` text NOT NULL

  You'll find more information regarding the new Session functionality
  in the Session class page:

	http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html

  >>> Update your Validation Syntax

  This is an optional, but recommended step, for people currently
  using the Validation class. CI 1.7 introduces a new Form Validation
  class (http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/form_validation.html)
  which deprecates the old Validation library. We have left the old one
  in place so that existing applications that use it will not break, but
  you are encouraged to migrate to the new version as soon as possible.
  Please read the user guide carefully as the new library works a little
  differently, and has several new features.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/sj3-server
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The sj3serv daemon in japanese/sj3-server port now uses "localhost"
  as the default listen address for security reason.  If you need
  the wildcard address (INADDR_ANY), you have to explicitly set
  "servername" to 0.0.0.0 in ${PREFIX}/etc/sj3/serverrc.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3 port have been split into
  japanese/canna-server and japanese/canna-lib, and japanese/sj3-server
  and japanese/sj3-lib, respectively for more fine-grained dependency
  management in the Ports Collection.

20080926:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid30
  AUTHOR: tmseck@netcologne.de

  The Squid developers decided to disable COSS support in 3.0, cf.
  the discussion starting here:

	http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-dev/200809/0067.html

  The corresponding port configuration option WITH_SQUID_COSS is still
  available but is a no-op for now.  If you currently use COSS storage with
  Squid 3.0 you need to disable it in squid.conf.

20080924:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  proftpd now stores its .delay and .scoreboard files in /var/run/proftpd
  instead of /var/run.  If you are updating an existing installation,
  adjust the following in /usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf:

	ScoreboardFile	/var/run/proftpd/proftpd.scoreboard

  Also of note: The third party modules, mod_codeconv, mod_comb, and
  mod_sql_tds are not compatible with this release and have been removed.
  They will be re-added when the respective authors provide updated versions.

20080909:
  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  logcheck now stores its configuration files in /usr/local/etc/logcheck
  instead of /usr/local/etc.  If you are upgrading the port from version
  1.1.1 to version 1.2.54, copy the following files to a temporary location,
  in case they are removed during the upgrade:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.hacking
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.ignore
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations.ignore

  e.g.:

	cd /usr/local/etc
	mkdir /tmp/logcheck.saveconf
	cp logcheck.hacking logcheck.ignore logcheck.violations* \
	   /tmp/logcheck.saveconf

  After the upgrade, integrate your local changes to the files listed
  above into the new configuration files found in the following directories:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/cracking.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.paranoid
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.workstation
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.ignore.d

  Please consult the following files for more information about
  logcheck rules and reporting levels:

	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck
	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck-database

  Also note that the upgraded port installs a crontab file for user
  "logcheck" that executes the logcheck script every hour and emails
  the results to root.  If the installation process cannot install
  the crontab file, it can be installed manually from
  /usr/local/share/examples/logcheck/crontab.in, e.g.:

	crontab -u logcheck /usr/local/share/examples/logcheck/crontab.in

20080907:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mediawiki
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  www/mediawiki version is 1.13 now.  1.12 version was preserved as

20080902:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nagios and net-mgmt/nagios-devel
  AUTHOR: Jarrod Sayers <jarrod@netleader.com.au>

  The stable Nagios port has now been updated to version 3.0.3.  Upgrading
  to this version shouldn't require any configuration changes, but note that
  most sample configuration files were moved into objects/ directory.

  Nagios 2.12 is still available as net-mgmt/nagios2, use the following to
  remain on this legacy stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  Nagios 3.x development continues in net-mgmt/nagios-devel, users of this
  port in production use should consider switching to the stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

20080902:
  AFFECTS: users of math/ploticus
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  This is a major update.

  Deprecated: server-side image maps (use client-side instead); definition
  of categories within proc areadef (use proc categories instead); proc print.

  Discontinued attributes: proc processdata's stack; proc usedata's element,
  proc getdata's rotate, and proc defineunits (use the $changeunits()
  function instead).

  proc rangebar has been renamed proc boxplot and there are major
  functionality changes.  Any script that uses proc rangebar will need
  maintenance.

  See http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/doc/news.html for more information.

20080901:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/pine4 and editors/pico
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  These two ports have been removed in favor of the new mail/alpine and
  editors/pico-alpine ports.  UW discontinued work on Pine in September
  2005 and is focusing on Alpine now.  You should be able to directly
  replace pine with alpine.

  See http://www.washington.edu/alpine/ for more information.

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/smokeping
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Smokeping has been updated to 2.4.1, and the example web server
  configuration has changed.  Please read pkg-message and check that
  your server configuration is OK.

20080827:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  With the default Makefile settings, most of the programs are now
  installed outside your $PATH, except for "git", "gitk", and some server
  side programs that need to be accessible for technical reasons.  Invoking
  a git subcommand as "git-xyzzy" from the command line has been deprecated
  since early 2006 (and officially announced in 1.5.4 release notes); use
  of them from your scripts after adding output from "git --exec-path" to
  the $PATH is still supported in this release, but users are again
  strongly encouraged to adjust their scripts to use "git xyzzy" form, as
  we will stop installing "git-xyzzy" hardlinks for built-in commands in
  later releases.

  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: pneumann@gmail.com

  The database schema has changed in this version of RabbitMQ.  If you
  attempt to start RabbitMQ-1.4.0 over top of a previous installation,
  it will fail, citing "schema_integrity_check_failed".  To correct this,
  delete your mnesia directory (/var/db/rabbitmq/mnesia) and restart
  the server.  Note that this will destroy all your durable exchanges and

  AFFECTS: users of mail/assp
  AUTHOR: J.R. Oldroyd <fbsd@opal.com>

  The periodic(8) script no longer outputs to files in the assp directory.
  You should remove /var/db/assp/nightly.log and nightly.log.old by hand
  once you are done with them.  The information that was stored there will
  now come in your nightly system email.

20080815:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/rdiff-backup
  AUTHOR: vd@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/rdiff-backup has been upgraded from 1.0.5 to 1.2.0.  This is
  an incompatible upgrade.  If you need the "old" 1.0.5, you can find it
  in sysutils/rdiff-backup10.

20080813:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  The layout of the ikiwiki.setup file has changed in a significant
  way in this release.  Old setup files will continue to work, but new
  features, like the new websetup interface, require a new format
  setup file.  You can convert old setup files into the new format by
  running the following command for all your ikiwiki.setup files:

	ikiwiki-transition setupformat ikiwiki.setup

20080812:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamdyke
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The spamdyke port has been updated to 4.0.2.  The new version is not
  backwards compatible with previous versions.  Please examine the new
  configuration file for the changes.

20080812:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/pgbouncer
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with port version 1.2.3, pgbouncer does not run as root anymore.
  If you are upgrading from earlier versions, please update your configuration
  in ${PREFIX}/etc/pgbouncer.ini to use log and pid file paths owned by the
  newly created pgbouncer user (or customize for a different user yourself).

  Default logfile: /var/log/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.log
  Default pidfile: /var/run/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.pid

20080808:
  AFFECTS: users of chinese/phpbb-tw
  AUTHOR: chinsan@FreeBSD.org

  The default install directory for phpbb-tw has changed from
  ${PREFIX}/www/data/phpBB2 to ${PREFIX}/www/phpBB2.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your settings
  and data, please do the following:

	mv /usr/local/www/data/phpBB2 /usr/local/www

  Then update as usual.

20080806:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Update to 1.3x, the net-p2p/transmission now is a meta-port. It depends on
  cli, daemon, and gtk2. If you don't want that, uninstall transmission and
  install net-p2p/transmission-cli by doing:

	portmaster -o net-p2p/transmission-cli net-p2p/transmission

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-p2p/transmission-cli net-p2p/transmission

20080805:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/qt4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The Qt 4 ports has been updated to 4.4.1.  With this update several ports
  specific problems have been fixed.  Qt 4 headers and libraries have been
  moved to include/qt4 and lib/qt4.  bsd.qt.mk defines QT_INCDIR and
  QT_LIBDIR now, which could be used in qt4-dependent ports if required.
  Before you start to update your ports, please force update of qmake4 and
  qt4-corelib ports.  Portmaster users can do:

	portmaster devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

20080804:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  Git's cvsps dependency has been switched from cvsps-devel to cvsps.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following before
  upgrading git:

	portmaster -o devel/cvsps devel/cvsps-devel

20080728:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius2
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  Upgrading the FreeRADIUS port used to replace all unmodified files
  in your configuration with the latest version from the sample
  configuration. This strategy has two disadvantages; over time your
  configuration became based on different versions of the sample
  configuration, also major changes to the sample configuration could
  leave your configuration in a confusing state.

  From version 2.0.5, your configuration is not touched if any
  configuration files have been modified.

  You are recommended to track changes in the sample configuration and
  keep your configuration in a version control system. I use Subversion
  (see the devel/subversion port) to track my changes. Keeping the sample
  configuration in a 'vendor branch' (see the Subversion book for more
  details) allows easy merging of changes from the sample configuration.

  *** IMPORTANT ***

  You are urged to move your configuration out of the default location
  (/usr/local/etc/raddb) before upgrading from 2.0.4 (or earlier)
  to 2.0.5 (or later). Once this upgrade is complete, remove the sample
  configuration that has been installed in the default location and
  move your configuration back to the default location.

  This is a one time procedure that will prevent unmodified files in
  your configuration from being deleted from your configuration and not
  restored during the upgrade. No customised files will be lost in any
  circumstances.

  The sample configuration in 2.0.5 has been reorganised: the
  configuration of most modules is now in the modules directory rather
  than in radiusd.conf. You are urged to rearrange your configuration
  to match this layout.

  There are several improvements in this version of the port, including
  a new pkg-message that will help new FreeRADIUS users to get started
  with the port, also new 'reload' and 'debug' commands for the rc.d
  script. Enjoy!

20080725:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fm/nautilus and misc/shared-mime-info
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  In order to properly update x11-fm/nautilus and misc/shared-mime-info, do
  the following using portupgrade:

	# pkg_deinstall -fO nautilus
	# portupgrade shared-mime-info
	# portinstall -O nautilus

  Once misc/shared-mime-info has been updated, each user will need to run
  the following command:

	$ update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/

20080725:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ojs2
  AUTHOR: Greg Larkin <glarkin@FreeBSD.org>

  If you are upgrading from a prior version of ojs2, please backup your
  database, uploaded files directory, and your config.inc.php before the
  upgrade.  Read /usr/local/share/docs/ojs2/UPGRADE or visit
  http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/UPGRADE for additional upgrade information.

20080721:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freenet6
  AUTHOR: Edwin Groothuis <edwin@mavetju.org>

  Please note that there has been a major update of this port (from
  version 2.x to 5.x) and that the name of the binaries and configuration
  files has changed from "tpsc" to "gw6c". The configuration files
  have to be copied from ${PREFIX}/share/examples/freenet6 to
  ${PREFIX}/etc again.

20080719:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fm/gprename
  AUTHOR: Martin Tournoij <carpetsmoker@rwxrwxrwx.net>

  GPRename configuration files now live ~/.config/gprename instead of ~/, to
  upgrade use the following commands:

	% mkdir -p ~/.config/gprename
	% mv ~/.gprename ~/.config/gprename/gprename
	% mv ~/.gprename_log ~/.config/gprename/gprename_log

20080717:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/anjuta
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Anjuta's neon dependency has been switched from neon26 to neon28.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following to upgrade:

	portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26
	portupgrade anjuta

20080714:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: Thomas-Martin Seck <tmseck@web.de>

  www/squid has been updated to Squid 2.7.STABLE3.

  The update should be rather straightforward.

  The only noticeable change in the port is that the ICAP patch is no
  longer included; this is because this patch was unmaintained for a long
  time and its use was not really recommended.  Please consider moving to
  Squid-3 (currently available as www/squid30) if you need ICAP support.

  Squid 2.6 is still available as www/squid26 and will probably be removed
  from the Ports Tree by the end of 2008.

20080712:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/rrdtool
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  If you use language bindings, like the Perl's RRDs, please upgrade
  this port *twice* in order to get the library dependency right.

20080711:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  The port has been deprecated and gtkdatabox has been updated. This was
  done so the port tracks vendor name. Please update by doing:

	portupgrade -o x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2

20080709:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki editpage form now uses the raw page name, not the page title,
  in its `page' CGI parameter.  You will need to rebuild any existing
  IkiWiki installations in order to update their `edit' links to the new
  format.

20080708:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-devel
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to a 20080620 SVN snapshot, which uses the
  new (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade qemu-devel with the
  KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20080705:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki search plug-in now uses www/xapian-omega as backend instead
  of textproc/hyperestraier.  You will need to update the configuration of
  any search enabled IkiWiki installations and rebuild them since the
  search form has changed.

20080704:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/shared-mime-info
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The misc/shared-mime-info has been updated to 0.40. The Mime Types caches
  have been changed a bit. If you have created any custom MIME types, you
  will need to run update-mime-database to update your local Mime Types
  caches:

	$ update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ratbox-services
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Configuration file and database changes have been made between the
  1.1.x series and the current release version of ratbox-services.

  It is highly recommended that services are stopped, and the proper
  upgrade procedure is followed as described in port's documentation,
  before restarting newly updated ratbox-services again.

  Please remember to backup the database before attempting an
  upgrade, as incorrectly upgraded database may be rendered unusable.

  The ratbox-services-1.2.x branch implements multi-language support.
  However, an inconsistency in the language indexing may result in
  errors. It is therefore recommended that the English default to be
  used until the next version release.

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/nocc
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  The Nocc configuration file has been moved into 'config' subdir.
  When updating, remove the old conf.php file and reconfigure Nocc.

20080701:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion*
  AUTHOR: Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>

  subversion now uses neon-0.28.x (www/neon28) port, and automatic
  portupgrade will fail because www/neon28 will conflict with installed
  www/neon26 port.

  You should upgrade neon library before subversion with the command:

	# portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26

  Also, if you use any special subversion ports with bindings, you
  should upgrade these ports to clean subversion port with

	# portupgrade -o devel/subversion subversion-\*

  and install needed bindings (p5-subversion, py-subversion and/or
  ruby-subversion) after that.

  If you use subversion with bindings installed from devel/subversion
  with custom options, don't forget to install separate bindings ports
  after subversion upgrade.

20080630:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/cairo, graphics/poppler*, and future users of www/firefox3
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The poppler* ports have been updated to 0.8.3 and the shared libraries
  have changed.  Firefox 3.0 has been added to the tree as www/firefox3.
  These changes require that all dependent ports be updated.  You can do
  this in one of two ways:

	# portmaster pixman
	# portmaster \*cairo\*
	# portmaster -r poppler-0

  or:

	# pkgdb -Ff
	# portupgrade pixman\* \*cairo\*
	# portupgrade -r poppler-0.\*

20080627:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati
  AUTHOR: Jung-uk Kim <jkim@FreeBSD.org>

  mach64 and r128 drivers are now separated out from the ati driver.
  These video cards are supported by x11-drivers/xf86-video-mach64
  and x11-drivers/xf86-video-r128 respectively. If you have one of
  the affected video cards and xorg.conf contains the following line:

	Driver	"ati"

  you must specify "mach64" or "r128". Alternatively, you may install
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati to get a wrapper driver.

20080626:
  AFFECTS: users of science/gramps
  AUTHOR: Anders Troback <freebsd@troback.com>

  Before you upgrade from 2.x to 3.x you need to export your existing
  databases to a GRAMPS XML file. After the upgrade you can import
  them into the new version.

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ircd-ratbox-devel
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Upgrading between different beta releases can cause problems when
  changes to the ban database schema have occurred.  The 'bantool'
  utility now comes with a -u switch that will check and update the
  ban database as necessary.

  Issuing 'bantool -u' is required when upgrading between beta releases
  and must not be done while the ircd is running.

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security
  AUTHOR: Marcelo Araujo <araujo@FreeBSD.org>

  The mod_security port has been updated from 1.9.4 to 2.5.5. Branch 1.9.x
  will not receive any further updates; all users must update mod_security
  port to versions 2.1 or 2.5.

  You can get more information about update issues at:

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera and www/opera/devel
  AUTHOR: Ion-Mihai Tetcu <itetcu@FreeBSD.org>

  The Opera port has been updated from 9.2x to 9.5x.  A lot of things have
  been changed such as keyboard shortcuts[1]; new storage and indexing
  formats for mail and feeds; new search.ini; native amd64 binaries; no 4.x
  support.  You will be asked whether to convert mail and feeds to new
  format during start up.  Warning: there is no way to downgrade back to
  the old format.  Be sure to see the Changelog[2].

	   with apr from www/apache22
  AUTHOR: Clement Laforet <clement@FreeBSD.org>

  apr and apr-util bundled with apache 2.2.9 have been upgraded to 1.3.x, so
  shared libraries versions have been bumped. If you are using subversion
  with apache22 apr, you must rebuild subversion after the update.

20080617:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/nvi-devel
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  editors/nvi-devel has been changed to install nvi, nex, and nview as
  to not conflict with editors/2bsd-vi.  Please note the new names if
  you use this port.

20080616:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dkim-milter
  AUTHOR: Hirohisa Yamaguchi <umq@ueo.co.jp>

  Most of the command line options can now be set in configure files.
  So the default values (such as milterdkim_socket) are changed to blank.
  Upgrading users should check the values both in rc.conf and
  dkim-filter.conf.

20080612:
  AFFECTS: users of www/linux-opera
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Opera port has been updated from 9.2x to 9.5x.  A lot of things have
  been changed such as keyboard shortcuts[1]; new storage and indexing
  formats for mail and feeds; new search.ini; probably more that I have
  missed.  I do not know if the keyboard shortcuts and search.ini will be
  overwritten.  You will be asked whether you want mail and feeds to be
  converted to new format during start up.  Warning: there is no way to
  downgrade back to the old format.  Be sure to see the Changelog[2].

  [1] http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/884/
  [2] http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/950/

  It is probably best for you to back up your linux-opera directory in
  case until you have no problem with new Opera for a while.  Also, you
  might have to re-configure search and keyboard shortcuts if these were
  overwritten:

	# cp -Rp ~/.linux-opera ~/.linux-opera-bak

  If you are seeing an error of undefined symbols related to GTK+, it is
  because it needs newer linux-gtk2 that ports doesn't have. You can enter
  'opera:config#FileSelector|DialogToolkit' in the address bar and change
  from 0 to 1 in 'Dialog Toolkit' if it annoys you.  0 = auto detection,
  1 = QT, and 2 = GTK+.

20080610:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/svnmailer
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Some of the config directives and sections allowed have changed.  You will
  have to edit your config file when updating to 1.1.0-dev-r1373 version of

  pear-Date_Holidays has been split into multiple subports. If you want
  a specific geographic region, look at devel/pear-Date_Holidays_*

20080605:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/paman and audio/pavucontrol
  AUTHOR: lippe@FreeBSD.org

  paman was renamed to pavucontrol, which are two different projects.
  paman is a GTK frontend to PulseAudio, while pavucontrol is a GTK-based
  volume control tool to PulseAudio.

20080605:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of the upgrade to gettext-0.17, the shared library version
  of libintl has changed, so you will need to rebuild all ports that
  depend on gettext:

	# portupgrade -rf gettext
	# portmaster -r gettext

  Given the scope and sheer number of dependent ports, it may be more
  advisable to simply blow away all existing install ports (after
  keeping any local configuration changes), and rebuilding from scratch.

20080603:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs
  AUTHOR: Yasuhiro KIMURA <yasu@utahime.org>

  The port (editors/emacs) is updated to 22.2 and some of Emacs Lisp
  directories had changed.  So you should reinstall all ports that depend
  on it.  Please do something like:

	# portupgrade -fr emacs

20080601:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  If password based logins is enabled in IkiWiki, those passwords were
  stored in cleartext in the userdb.  To guard against exposing users'
  passwords, IkiWiki 2.48 and later use strong (blowfish) hashes for
  storing passwords.

  To hash existing passwords, update to ikiwiki-2.48 and run the
  following command for each of your IkiWiki src dirs:

	ikiwiki-transition hashpassword /path/to/your/wiki/srcdir

  Starting with version 2.2.0, resolver is now built in the S2S component.
  Jabberd configuration files require updating:

	jabberd.cfg: resolver component must be removed
	s2s.xml: <lookup> section must be added (see s2s.xml.dist)
	resolver.xml: may be deleted (file not required anymore)

20080519:
  AFFECTS: users of www/nginx and www/nginx-devel
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  Nginx version lines have been changed: 0.5 -> 0.6 for stable and

20080519:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/bitlbee
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  The default installation is now configured for running bitlbee as

  readable by that user.

20080517:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/smplayer-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The slave port multimedia/smplayer-qt4 has been removed with the upgrade
  of multimedia/smplayer to 0.6.0, qt3 is no longer supported. They are now
  fully integrated into multimedia/smplayer.

  Please uninstall multimedia/smplayer-qt4 port before upgrading
  multimedia/smplayer to version 0.6.0 or higher.

20080513:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: scheidell@secnap.net

  Amavisd-new 2.6.0 introduces several incompatibilities with prior versions.
  If you are upgrading from 2.5.4 or earlier, you will need to update your
  SQL schema.  If you have third party programs that access SQL tables, you
  will need to update those also.

  COMPATIBILITY WITH 2.5.4:

  - when using SQL for logging (e.g. for a pen pals feature) or for
    quarantining, SQL tables maddr, msgs, msgrcpt and quarantine need
    to be extended by a new field 'partition_tag';  see below for details;

  - when SQL logging (pen pals) or SQL lookups are used, one can choose a
    binary or a character data type for fields users.email, mailaddr.email,
    and maddr.email; now may be a good opportunity to change a data type
    to binary (string of bytes);  see below for details;

  - when using SQL for logging, a default for $sql_clause{'upd_msg'}
    has changed, so if a configuration file replaces this SQL clause
    by a non-default setting, it needs to be updated;

  Full information in /usr/local/share/doc/amavisd-new/RELEASE_NOTES.

20080513:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/ampache
  AUTHOR: jadawin@FreeBSD.org

  Ampache 3.4 uses a different config parser.  Unfortunately the new parser
  is unable to read old config files.  In order to migrate your current
  configuration, you should run `php ${WWWDIR}/bin/migrate_config.inc' from
  the command line.

20080508:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/ptop
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The authors have changed the name of this utility to `pg_top'.  To avoid
  conflict with another port in the Tree with the same name we have retained
  `ptop' as the portname.  Note that binary has also changed to `pg_top'.
  Please start the utility with that name after updating.

20080507:
  AFFECTS: Perl interface users of audio/gramofile
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  Perl support is removed due to devel/swig11 removal in ports.  If you use
  the Perl interface, you are encouraged to use the new Audio::Gramofile
  found on CPAN (contact me for the ports).

20080506:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/collectd
  AUTHOR: daniel@roe.ch

  Previously, net-mgmt/collectd used to remove the config file even if it
  was changed by the user. This has now been fixed.

  To upgrade without losing your configuration, copy
  ${PREFIX}/etc/collectd.conf away to a safe place before upgrading
  net-mgmt/collectd.

  In addition, the default location of the data files changed from
  ${PREFIX}/var/lib/collectd to /var/db/collectd; you may want to move your
  data files and edit your configuration accordingly.

20080503:
  AFFECTS: users of net/skype-devel

  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-Apache-Test
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/p5-Apache-Test doesn't actually need www/mod_perl{1,2}. If you would
  like to test a mod_perl, than please install www/mod_perl2 or www/mod_perl
  as well. The ports infrastructure doesn't support this (yet) but you can
  use it to test www/apache13, www/apache20, and/or www/apache22 without
  chaining www/p5-Apache-Test.

20080405:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/tracker
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org

  The sysutils/tracker port is now a meta port and tracker is now split into

  AFFECTS: users of devel/glib20 and future users of devel/gio-fam-backend
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  In order to update to glib 2.16 or higher, you must first update the
  glib20 port on its own or you will get a failure trying to install
  devel/gio-fam-backend saying it cannot find -lgio-2.0.  Portmaster users
  can do:

	portmaster glib-2

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade glib-2\*

  4. Set appropriate sysctl (sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16)
  5. Install emulators/linux_base-fc6
  6  Remount linprocfs (mount /compat/linux/proc)
  7. Add compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 to etc/sysctl.conf
  8. Add OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=fc6 to /etc/make.conf

  Note: These instructions also apply to linux_base-f8, please use the same
  osrelease.

  For FreeBSD versions 5.X and 6.X:

  Please use the legacy version net/skype12:

	portupgrade -o net/skype12 net/skype

20080316:

  AFFECTS: users of mail/ezmlm-web
  AUTHOR: hans@nordhaug.priv.no

  The layout of ezmlm-web 3.2 is changed, please read documentation and
  the manual page of ezmlm-web.cgi.

20080312:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/enlightenment-devel, x11/ecore and grephics/evas
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  Evas and ecore ports have been split to separate modules to simplify
  dependency tracking. Thus, portupgrade in many cases won't be able to
  correctly update these ports.

  The easiest upgrade path would be to remove all EFL ports and install
  them from scratch. At least, you should reinstall ecore and evas.

  Please note that your old $HOME/.e is no longer compatible with new
  snapshot version. You will need to remove this directory and let e17
  create it automatically on the next startup.

20080306:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The update to version 1.0.12 will require manual change to the active
  configuration file.

  mail_extra_groups setting was commonly used insecurely. This setting is now
  deprecated. Most users should switch to using mail_privileged_group setting,
  but if you really need the old functionality use mail_access_groups instead.

20080303:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  gnutls has been updated to 2.2.2 and all shared libraries versions have
  been bumped.  So you need to rebuild all applications that depend on
  gnutls. Do something like:

	portupgrade -rf gnutls

20080223:
  AFFECTS: users of www/instiki
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The default installation directory for instiki has changed from
  /usr/local/instiki to /usr/local/share/instiki.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your
  settings and data, please do the following:

	mv /usr/local/instiki /usr/local/share

  Then update as usual.

20080219:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xmonad
  AUTHOR: jacula@gmail.com

  From now XMonad uses a new configuration file system, so you don't have
  to edit Config.hs anymore.  Instead, create a custom configuration file
  ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs.  You can take a look at some samples on Xmonad's
  website.  Note that you can be interested in x11-wm/xmonad-contrib.

20080218:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/poco and devel/poco-ssl
  AUTHOR: lippemail@gmail.com

  The HashFunction class template has been changed in an incompatible way.
  The member function formerly named hash() is now the function call
  operator.  If you have defined your own HashFunction classes, then you
  have to update your code.

20080216:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/symon
  AUTHOR: uspoerlein@gmail.com

  The symon port has been updated from 2.75 to 2.78. It changes the wire
  protocol again. You should update your symux(8) and symon(8) installations
  simultaneously, as:

    - new symon clients will make old symux servers exit, and
    - new symux servers don't understand the old symon client's if() and
      mem() probes.

20080208:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  As was claimed in the entry 20070301 below in this file, you should fill
  ALT_DEPENDS section of pkgtools.conf for portupgrade to work correctly
  with your alternative dependencies.  Now it is an obligatory requirement.

  It was done as a compromise between speed and complexity.

20080203:
  AFFECTS: users of www/xshttpd
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  www/xshttpd now uses ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/ as a root directory for its
  data files.  The xshttpd configuration files have been moved to
  ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/conf/.  Please move the appropriate local files
  manually if you are upgrading from 3.4 or older versions.

20080202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/punbb
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  Install paths have changed. Please do the following prior to upgrade:

	cd /usr/local/www
	mv punbb punbb.old
	cp -R punbb.old/upload punbb

  It is now safe to update as usual.

  Notes:

  * You will probably get uninstall errors regarding files not found. It's
    safe to ignore them
  * Your webserver path has changed from www/punbb/upload to www/punbb,
    please adjust your webserver configuration and restart it
  * When you are satisfied with everything working properly you may remove
    the punbb.old directory:
	rm -r /usr/local/www/punbb.old

  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Deluge was updated to version 0.5.8.2.  If you are using blocklist plugin,
  you have to remove blocklist.conf first before you can run it, or it will
  crash upon start up.

	$ rm -f ~/.config/deluge/blocklist.conf

20080125:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security2
  AUTHOR: araujo@FreeBSD.org

  Update of mod_security2 is a dramatic change, because there is a need
  to completely rewrite their obsolete rules and migrate for capacity to
  use new syntax.

  You are advised to make a complete backup of your configuration files
  before you can perform an update.

20080120:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache20

20080118:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  FreeRADIUS 2.0 is now available as the net/freeradius2 port. All FreeRADIUS
  users are advised to consider upgrading to 2.0. It is the FreeRADIUS team's
  intention to put the 1.x server into 'maintenance' mode with just critical
  bug fixes.[1] 2.0 has many improvements including numerous bug fixes that
  were too difficult for the 1.x server, as well as many new features.

  Before uninstalling 1.x, it is recommended that you backup your
  configuration, which is typically in /usr/local/etc/raddb, then move it
  out of the way. It is also worth backing up the default configuration,
  which is typically in /usr/local/share/examples/freeradius/raddb.

  1.x configurations should work with the 2.0 server [2]. However the port
  automatically upgrades any unedited files in the configuration when you
  install a new version of FreeRADIUS. Installing 2.0 with the residue of a
  1.x configuration in the default location will result in a mixed 1.x and
  2.0 configuration that may not work.

  The recommended approach is to diff your 1.x configuration against the
  default 1.x configuration, then make corresponding changes to a copy
  of the default 2.0 configuration. If you moved your 1.x configuration out
  of the way before upgrading, you will have a 2.0 configuration ready to
  edit in the default location. It is worth reading man 5 unlang for details
  of the new FreeRADIUS 'un-language' before starting.

  Alternatively, you can move your 1.x configuration to another location,
  such as /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1, then edit /etc/rc.conf to point the rc.d
  script to that location. For example:

	radiusd_flags="-d /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1"

  I cannot guarantee that all 1.x configurations will work with the 2.0
  server, and I only recommend using a 1.x configuration as an interim
  measure.

  Perforce has been updated to version 2007.3. Upgrading is fairly
  straightforward, but it is still highly recommended to follow the
  upgrading instructions in the release notes:

  AFFECTS: users of irc/bitlbee
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  irc/bitlbee now stores saved user settings in /var/db/bitlbee/, not
  $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/.  You will have to manually move any existing user
  settings to the new location (or override the user settings directory
  using -d if you wish to keep the old behavior).  Other configuration
  files are still kept in $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/ by default.

  The default installation is now configured for running bitlbee as user
  'nobody' by default.  Make sure any existing configuration files are
  readable by that user.
