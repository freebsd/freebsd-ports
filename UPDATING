This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports. We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

20070404:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/gimp and graphics/gimp-devel
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org

  The gimp[-devel] port is now a meta-port so users will need to upgrade via
  one of the following examples

  portmaster users:
   (gimp)
  portmaster -o graphics/gimp-app gimp
  portmaster -u graphics/gimp
   (gimp-devel)
  portmaster -o graphics/gimp-app-devel gimp-devel
  portmaster -u graphics/gimp-devel

  portupgrade users:
   (gimp)
  portupgrade -o graphics/gimp-app gimp
  portupgrade -u graphics/gimp

20070404:
  AFFECTS: users of print/gutenprint
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org

  The gutenprint port is now a meta-port so users will need to upgrade via
  one of the following examples

  portmaster users:
  portmaster -o print/gutenprint-base gutenprint
  portmaster -u print/gutenprint

  portupgrade users:
  portupgrade -o print/gutenprint-base gutenprint
  portupgrade -u print/gutenprint
  
20070402:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/cvstrac
  AUTHOR: nkoch@demig.de

  cvstrac is changed to use SQLite 3, users should backup their database
  then restore after upgrading. For example,

  mv cvstrac.db cvstrac_2.db
  sqlite cvstrac_2.db .dump | sqlite3 cvstrac.db

20070327:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux_base-fc6
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  ATTENTION! The port is experimental for now. Use it at your own risk. This
  port may be used only with 7-CURRENT and compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16.

  To use/test the port (along with linux FC4 infrastructure ports) you
  should do:

  0. Backup all your vital information!
  1. Remove the current linux base port.
  2. Add to your /etc/make.conf "OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=fc6".
  3. Make sure no linux application is running.
  4. Set apropriate sysctl (compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16).
  5. Install emulation/linux_base-fc6.
  5a. Those who use linux ports with automatic plist building should
      apply the following patch:
      ftp://mail.ipt.ru/pub/FreeBSD/patches/bsd.linux-rpm.mk-autoplist.diff

  That should be enough at most circumstances. If you have difficulties,
  please be sure to expand item 1 to:

  1a. Remove all ports which depends on linux base port.
  1b. Remove linux base port.
  1c. Clean /compat/linux/ directory.

  In case you want to get rid of the port, deinstall it, then return
  back compat.linux.osrelease to 2.4.2 (as usual make sure that no
  linux application is running) and remove from /etc/make.conf the line
  containing the OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT variable.

20070327:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/tcl-tk-wrapper, lang/tcl*, x11-toolkits/tk*
  AUTHOR: martin@matuska.org

  The lang/tcl-tk-wrapper port has been replaced by lang/tcl-wrapper and
  x11-toolkits/tk-wrapper ports. The Tcl and Tk ports no longer include an
  option to install the wrapper - the wrapper ports require a Tcl/Tk instead.
  The new configuration files in local etc are named: tclsh.conf wish.conf

20070327:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-sip and x11-toolkits/py-qt
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  py-sip and py-qt has been updated to the latest snapshot. Please update
  py-sip *before* updating py-qt and/or installing py-qt4-*. The full changelog
  can be found at http://people.freebsd.org/~miwi/py-qt4.txt

20070325:
  AFFECTS: users of www/drupal and drupal-*
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  All 4.x drupal ports are renamed to have a drupal4 prefix. As a result,
  default install location is changed from PREFIX/www/drupal to
  PREFIX/www/drupal4. Take some precautions when upgrading.

20070319:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/fluxbox and x11-wm/fluxbox-devel
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The x11-wm/fluxbox-devel has been merged into x11-wm/fluxbox. You should
  be back up your ~/.fluxbox and remove it. If you still want to keep to
  use the same ~/.fluxbox, then you will have to do this:

  	- The prefix has been changed from X11BASE (/usr/X11R6) to
  	  LOCALBASE (/usr/local). You might have to edit a few of paths in
  	  the ~/.fluxbox/* if there is any.
  	- The bsetroot has been renamed to fbsetroot. You might have to
  	  tweak a few of theme for bsetroot -> fbsetroot. Other way can be
  	  done is to install the x11-wm/boxtools that has bsetroot if you
  	  don't want to edit any theme.

  While I am here, don't forget to use 'pkgdb -Ff'. As for the portmaster
  users, I don't think you will need to do anything since portmaster will
  taking care of it by default.

20070318:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (ie: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of the upgrade to gettext-0.16.1, the shared library version
  of libintl has changed, so you will need to rebuild all ports that
  depend on gettext (ie: most of them, sorry):

    portupgrade -rf gettext

  or

    portmaster -r gettext

  In addition, if you have multimedia/vlc installed, you should deinstall
  it *before* either of the above commands, and reinstall it manually
  afterwards - vlc erroneously installs its own version of lib/charset.alias
  which will overwrite the one supplied by devel/gettext otherwise.

20070313:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@freebsd.org

  The HAL option has been turned on by default and the fstabbackend
  patches which have kept the fstab backend for the media kioslave
  at the status quo of KDE 3.5.3 have been removed. This means that

     MOUNTING DEVICES THROUGH KDE WILL NO LONGER WORK WITHOUT HAL.

  Thus if you wish to use device icons or the media:/ view in konqueror,
  make sure to turn on the HAL option in the x11/kdebase3 port and also 
  read /usr/ports/UPDATING entry 20061219 and
  http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq2.html#q19 for more information on
  using HAL.

20070312:
  AFFECTS: all users of net/py-libdnet
  AUTHOR: tmclaugh@FreeBSD.org

  The py-libdnet port has been separated out as a slave port to libdnet and
  is now dependent on libdnet.  py-libdnet now only installs the libdnet
  python modules.  Since files previously owned by py-libdnet are now owned
  by its dependency, in order to upgrade correctly, py-libdnet must be
  deinstall and then reinstalled manually.

20070205:
  AFFECTS: all users of FreeBSD 4.X
  AUTHOR: portmgr@FreeBSD.org

  The remnants of FreeBSD 4.X support have been removed from bsd.port.mk.
  Any remaining users should _not_ get this or any subsequent updates.

20070311:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/enlightenment-devel
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  The binary used to start an enlightenment session was renamed from
  enlightenment to enlightenment_start. All users should update their
  xinitrc's or other startup files to reflect this change.

20070301:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portupgrade*
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  Because of a bug in previous version, it's recommended you fill ALT_PKGDEP
  section in pkgtools.conf file for portupgrade be aware of alternative
  dependencies you use, and run pkgdb -L to restore dependencies that was
  lost.

  Example of ALT_PKGDEP section:
  ALT_PKGDEP = {
    'www/apache13' => 'www/apache13-modssl',
    'print/ghostscript-afpl' => 'print/ghostscript-gnu',
  }

  Note also, portupgrade knows nothing how to handle ports with different
  suffixes (E.g. -nox11). So you should define explicitly variables
  (E.g. WITHOUT_X11=yes) for the ports in /etc/make.conf or pkgtools.conf
  (MAKE_ARGS section) files.

20070227:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/jabber*
  AUTHOR: martin@matuska.org

  With update to version 1.6.0 the name of the jabber daemon has been
  changed to bin/jabberd14 to avoid conflicts with other jabber daemons.
  The port now supports WITH_MYSQL and WITH_POSTGRESQL knobs.

  If you are using one of the following ports please recompile it due
  to changes in the library.

  net-im/jabber-conference
  net-im/jabber-jud
  net-im/jabber-yahoo

  Some configuration directives have changed, too. Please see example
  configuration files and README.jabberd14 files in the ports above.

20070223:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/speex and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The shared library version has been changed in audio/speex, so you will
  have to rebuild all ports that depend on speex. You need to do following:

  Portupgrade users:

  	pkgdb -Ff
  	portupgrade -rf speex\*

  Portmaster users, skip a first step if you don't have audio/speex-devel
  installed:

  	portmaster -o audio/speex speex-devel\*
  	portmaster -r speex\*

20070218:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/symon
  AUTHOR: uspoerlein@gmail.com

  The symon port has been updated from 2.72 to 2.75. It changes the wire
  protocol, therefore, you should update your symux(8) installation first,
  before updating your symon(8) clients. symux(8) is backwards compatible and
  understands both protocol versions.

20070215:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  Since version 0.90, clamd.conf and clamav.conf have changed their syntax.
  All parameters can now be turned on/off using a boolean value (0,1) or
  (on,off) or (true,false), the old crude hack of "DisableDefaultScanOptions"
  is no longer required.

  Please, check ${PREFIX}/etc/(clamd|freshclam).conf.default and make needed
  changes on your conf files.

20070215:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-turbogears
  AUTHOR: nivit@FreeBSD.org

  TurboGears has been updated from version 0.8.9 to 1.0.1,
  so there are significant changes. After upgrading the port,
  with the usual portupgrade/portmanager command, it is highly
  recommended to follow the instructions at this URL:

     http://www.turbogears.com/download/upgrade.html

  starting from section "Updating from 0.8 to 0.9" on, to make
  your projects/code consistent with the new version.

20070210:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@freebsd.org

  The media kioslave now mounts cdrom/dvd volumes with local charset
  conversion (mount_cd9660 -C <charset>), which requires the cd9660_iconv
  kernel module to be available for volumes with ISO 9660 filesystems and
  the udf and udf_iconv kernel modules for UDF filesystems.

20070209:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  nVidia continues to drop support for old ("legacy") GPUs.  To deal with
  this fact, the port now allows to specify correct NVVERSION in order to
  build driver that supports your graphics card.  Currently, supported
  "legacy" values are 7184 and 9631.  Consult nVidia's README (Appendix A)
  to find out whether you need to use legacy driver version, and exactly
  which one.  Alternatively, you can install one of the corresponding
  `x11/nvidia-driver-XXXX' slave ports, where XXXX == needed NVVERSION.

20070208:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/pear-MDB2
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  All databases dependent bits are moved into other PEAR modules. You need
  to install appropriate databases/pear-MDB2_Driver_* port.

20070207:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid*
  AUTHOR: tmseck@netcologne.de

  The www/squid port has been updated to 2.6.  If you are updating from Squid
  2.5, please read the Squid release notes at
  http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.6/squid-2.6.STABLE9-RELEASENOTES.html
  and see whether you need to adapt your squid.conf to the changes described
  there.

  Squid 2.5 will be available as www/squid25 for next few months.  But note
  it's no longer being maintained by the Squid developers.

20070206:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  qemu now uses aio at least for ide dma, so if you get
  "Invalid system call" crashes that is because aio is not (kld)loaded.

20070206:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/djvulibre
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  djview was renamed to djview3. For now, the symlink djview->djview3
  installed for compatibility. However, users should refer to djview3(1)
  instead of djview(1).

20070205:
  AFFECTS: prospective users of devel/qt4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The qt4 ports and associated infrastructure introduce a few new
  Makefile variables and porting concepts (compared to qt33).

  For details and examples, see
  http://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-freebsd/2007-February/000239.html

20070205:
  AFFECTS: everybody
  AUTHOR: pav@FreeBSD.org

  New ports category was created - /usr/ports/ports-mgmt

  Most significant port moved to this new category is portupgrade.
  So don't be alarmed, it was not deleted. You can find it now in

  /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade

20070205:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/portmk
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  With the repocopy of portmk to ports-mgmt, you need to update your
  make.conf.  Change the two Makevars BSDPORTMK and BSDPORTSUBDIRMK
  to point to ports-mgmt/portmk.

20070202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/aolserver
  AUTHOR: martin@matuska.org

  With update to aolserver 4.5.0 modules have been moved to separate ports.

  The following modules are available initially:
    archivers/aolserver-nszlib
    databases/aolserver-nsmysql
    databases/aolserver-nspostgres
    graphics/aolserver-nsgd
    security/aolserver-nsencrypt
    security/aolserver-nsmcrypt
    security/aolserver-nsmhash
    security/aolserver-nsopenssl
    security/aolserver-nssha1
    www/aolserver-nscache

  A different aolserver install directory for aolserver and modules
  can be specified by defining AOLSERVERBASE in make.conf

  The rc.d script has been renamed from aolserver.sh to aolserver.

20070102:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  If you have a problem with upgrading the tools from version 2.2.1 and less,
  remove the package with pkg_delete portupgrade\* command and reinstall it
  from scratch. Remove /usr/ports/INDEX*.db and run portsdb -u.

20070130:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/powerdns
  AUTHOR: tremere@cainites.net

  The configuration file was moved from /usr/local/etc to /usr/local/etc/pdns.

20070127:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: robin@isometry.net

  Since dovecot-1.0.r15, the port has reserved UID/GID 143.
  If you are upgrading from an earlier version, please allow the uninstall
  script to remove the dovecot user and group or remove them manually prior
  to reinstalling the new version.
  If your prefer to maintain your existing user/group, you may override this
  change with the DOVECOT_UID/DOVECOT_GID environment variables at
  installation time.

20070115:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lightsquid
  AUTHOR: clsung@FreeBSD.org

  The default configuration files have changed to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/lightsquid.

20070111:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/weechat
  AUTHOR: az@FreeBSD.org

  For users of any previous version, all your charset settings
  in weechat.rc will be LOST! You should save your weechat.rc
  to keep your values and set them again with new "charset" plugin.
  For ISO users: history of channels may be without accents
  (after /upgrade), this is not recoverable, but this is not a bug.
  All new messages should be ok.
  Be careful, now default encode is UTF-8 for all channels (before
  it was terminal charset). If you still want to send messages as
  ISO-8859-1, you should send either global encode or server specific
  encode to ISO-8859-1.
  For global encode:  /setp charset.global.encode = "ISO-8859-1"
  For server encode: (on server buffer)  /charset encode ISO-8859-1

20070109:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql*
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The server-side utilities of postgresql (initdb, initlocation,
  ipcclean, pg_controldata, pg_ctl, pg_id and pg_resetxlog) are now
  installed by the respective postgresql*-server port (previously
  they where installed with the client). If you update the client, you
  should also update the server to make sure you are not left without
  the server-side tools. Do something like:

    portupgrade postgresql-client postgresql-server

20070105:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamprobe
  AUTHOR: stefan@FreeBSD.org

  With the update to version 1.4d, the SpamProbe port doesn't use the OPTIONS
  framework any more to allow part of the changes below. That means that options
  selected for this port won't be saved/used automatically any more and you have
  to set the appropriate variables in /etc/make.conf or on the command line to
  change the port's behaviour; the variables are documented at the top of the
  port's Makefile. Before updating, it might be a good idea to remove
  /var/db/ports/spamprobe.

  The port now has support for the PBL database backend; unless built with
  WITHOUT_PBL set, SpamProbe will use PBL as the default even if you have an
  existing BerkleyDB or hash database; in that case, use the parameter "-d" to
  specify the type of the existing database on the command line, e.g.

    spamprobe -d bdb:$HOME/.spamprobe receive

  or

    spamprobe -d hash:$HOME/.spamprobe receive

  Using PBL instead of BerkleyDB might be a good idea, though, as the former
  seems to perform better. You can convert your existing database to PBL using
  the following commands (assuming you didn't disable PBL support):

    cd ~
    mkdir spamprobe.new
    spamprobe -d bdb:.spamprobe export | spamprobe -d spamprobe.new import
    mv .spamprobe spamprobe.old
    mv spamprobe.new .spamprobe

20070106:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libwhisker
  AUTHOR: araujo@bsdmail.org

  Libwhisker 2.0 is *not* backwards-compatible with Libwhisker 1.x.
  Changing 'use LW' to 'use LW2' in your programs is not enough--you may
  need to make code changes to your program.

  However, there is a 'bridge' LW.pm module in which will use LW2
  (libwhisker 2.x) functions to emulate the LW (libwhisker 1.x)
  functionality.

  See http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/libwhisker/README2 for more details.

20070104:
  AFFECTS: users of www/phpsurveyor
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default install location has changed from
  ${PREFIX}/www/data/phpsurveyor to ${PREFIX}/www/phpsurveyor.

20070104:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/hal
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  If atapicam is enabled in the kernel, hald will use the CAM device nodes
  instead of ATAPI device nodes to access disc devices (e.g. CD-ROMS,
  DVD drives, etc.).  Previously, hald would use ATAPI device nodes even
  if atapicam was enabled.  The previous behavior can be restored by
  following the instructions in /usr/local/share/doc/hal-0.5.8/README.freebsd.

20070102:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  gnutls has been updated to 1.6.1 and all shared libraries' versions
  have been bumped. So you need to rebuild all applications that
  depend on gnutls. Do something like:

        portupgrade -rf gnutls

20061231:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sylpheed-claws*
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  Sylpheed-Claws has been renamed to Claws-Mail upstream. The port and the ports
  for the plug-ins have been renamed. If you didn't install claws-mail
  already you need to:
	portupgrade -o mail/claws-mail sylpheed-claws-2.6\*

20061221:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnupg
  AUTHOR: kuriyama@FreeBSD.org

  The security/gnupg port was upgraded to 2.0.1 (with security fix)
  and good-old gnupg-1.4.6 was repocopied to security/gnupg1.

  Both of security/gnupg (2.x) and security/gnupg1 (1.4.x) are
  designed not to conflict with each other.  So you can use
  security/gnupg1 for gpg(1), and use security/gnupg for gpg2(1)
  commands.

  All directly dependents are $PORTREVISION bumped, so portupgrade -R
  gnupg will works fine.  After portupgrade, you will have both of
  gnupg-2.0.1 and gnupg-1.4.6.

20061219:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you choose to enable the HAL backend for the media kioslave,
  you should enable dbus, hal and policy kit during system startup.
  To do this, add the following lines to /etc/rc.conf:

  dbus_enable="YES"
  polkitd_enable="YES"
  hald_enable="YES"

  Notes / known problems about mounting devices in media:/ with HAL enabled:

  - Your user must be in group operator in order to be able to mount removable
    media.

  - Removable media drives (such as CD-ROM drives) *MUST NOT* be listed in
    /etc/fstab in order to be mountable.

  - If you mount a volume by double-clicking it, it may appear empty. Refresh
    the fileview in konqueror to see the files.

  - Mounting floppies is currently not supported.

    You can still mount them in KDE if ...

    - You have an fstab entry for your floppy pointing to a mountpoint
      owned by your user (i.e. somewhere in your homedir)
    - The vfs.usermount sysctl is set to 1

     ... by creating a floppy device icon on your KDE desktop and selecting
	 the above-mentioned fstab entry in the device dropdown list on the
         device tab.

  - Mounting volumes from fixed drives is prohibited for non-superusers
    by default.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-PAR
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  As of version 0.97.0, all PAR::Packer logic, i.e. pp, parl and

  install devel/p5-PAR-Packer to get them.

20061207:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba3
  AUTHOR: timur@gnu.org

  Version 3.0.23d of net/samba3 finally got ability to conditionally
  link smbd daemon against FAM libraries. If you don't need this
  support make sure that it's not selected in the options menu -
  run 'make config' to verify it. You can remove FAM package if it
  was installed before as a part of Samba dependencies.

20061201:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/assp
  AUTHOR: fbsd@opal.com

  This version of ASSP switches virus detection support from
  Mail::ClamAV to File::Scan::ClamAV which uses the external clamd
  daemon from the security/clamav port. You will need to ensure
  clamd is configured and running if you wish to use ASSP's CLAMAV
  option. The default means for ASSP to communicate with clamd
  has been set to match clamd's UNIX socket: /var/run/clamav/clamd.
  If you use clamd with a TCP socket, you should configure ASSP's
  AvClamdPort option to 3310 or whatever socket you use.

20061130:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap2[34]-server
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default Berkeley DB version has been changed from
  4.3 to 4.4, as suggested by OpenLDAP developers.

  Suggested upgrade step:
    - Stop OpenLDAP server (i.e. ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/slapd stop)
    - Backup the OpenLDAP database (typically, /var/db/openldap-data)
      with your favorite tool
    - Do a "slapcat > backup.ldif" to dump all data
    - portupgrade net/openldap23-server
    - Remove BDB files from your /var/db/openldap-data;  you will want
      to keep DB_CONFIG as-is.
    - Do a "slapadd < backup.ldif" to restore the data

  Alternatively, if you want to keep the current BDB version (4.3),
  please define WITH_BDB_VER=43 when building the server.

20061121:
  AFFECTS: users of www/hastymail

20061106
  AFFECTS: Users of net/freeradius
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  FreeBSD used to patch FreeRADIUS's rlm_mschap.c to strip all domain names
  when calculating the hash of an MS-CHAP challenge (a requirement specified
  in RFC 2759 paragraph 4 and amplified in paragraph 8.2). FreeRADIUS now
  offers its own solution to discard a domain name before hashing in the
  MS-CHAP code, which can be enabled via a configuration option. As there is
  no longer any need for the FreeBSD patch, it has been removed, leaving the
  MS-CHAP code behaving as supplied by the FreeRADIUS team.

  If the previous behaviour of the MS-CHAP code is required, add:

  with_ntdomain_hack = yes

  to the mschap { } section of your FreeRADIUS configuration. There should be
  a commented out line that can be modified around line 696 of
  ${PREFIX}/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf if your configuration is based on the
  sample FreeRADIUS configuration.

  This option is not set by default in the sample FreeRADIUS configuration.
  Only those who have clients sending a domain name as part of the user name
  when using MS-CHAP will be affected by this change; they will need to set
  this option to allow FreeRADIUS to authenticate their clients successfully.
  This may only affect those with older Windows clients, but I cannot be sure.

  Some sources suggest setting this configuration option anyway to prevent
  FreeRADIUS from breaching RFC 2759 inadvertently, leading to authentication
  failure. It is left to the user whether to set this configuration option
  anyway, or only to set it in the event of authentication failures stemming
  from MS-CHAP.

  Debug output from radiusd that reads "rlm_mschap: NT Domain delimeter found,
  should we have enabled with_ntdomain_hack?" suggests that this configuration
  option should be enabled.

  New maintainer alerted to this issue by private mail from Thomas Vogt
  <thomas@bsdunix.ch>.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/avr-gcc*
  AUTHOR: joerg@FreeBSD.org

  The old avr-gcc port has been renamed into avr-gcc-3, and continues
  support for GCC 3.x (for a while).

  The former avr-gcc-devel port has been moved into avr-gcc, so GCC
  4.x is now the default.

  There is an entry in MOVED for the latter change but not for the
  former one, as the automated tools (e.g. portupgrade) got confused
  otherwise.

  If you've previously been using avr-gcc-devel, these tools should
  automatically take notice (based on the entry in MOVED), and change
  the installed package to avr-gcc.

  If you've previously been using avr-gcc, and want to move on to the
  new default GCC 4.x, this should be fully automatic, as the port
  name just stays, and the version increases.

  If you've previously been using avr-gcc, and want to stay at GCC 3.x
  for some reason, please manually perform a portupgrade to the new
  name:

  portupgrade -o devel/avr-gcc-3 avr-gcc

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba3
  AUTHOR: timur@gnu.org

  Revision of Samba 3.0.23c port had changed location of the directory,
  where Samba stores it's smbpasswd files from $PREFIX/private to a more
  common $PREFIX/etc/samba.

  You need to move *.tdb files from an old to new location and remove old
  directory if you use tdbsam backend for Samba user authentication.

  Starting with the 3.0.23c release, the officially supported passdb
  backends (smbpasswd, tdbsam, and ldapsam) now operate identically with
  regards to the historical RID algorithm for unmapped users and groups
  (i.e. accounts not in the passdb or group mapping table). The resulting
  behavior is that all unmapped users are resolved to a SID in the
  S-1-22-1 domain and all unmapped groups resolve to a SID in the S-1-22-2
  domain. Previously, when using the smbpasswd passdb, such users and
  groups would resolve to an algorithmic SID in the machine's own domain
  (S-1-5-XX-XX-XX). However, the smbpasswd backend still utilizes the RID
  algorithm when creating new user accounts or allocating a RID for a new
  group mapping entry.

  With the changes in the 3.0.23c release, it is now possible to resolve
  a uid/gid, name, or SID in any direction and always obtain a symmetric
  mapping. This is important so that values for smb.conf parameters such
  as "valid users" resolve to the same SIDs as those included in the
  local user's initial token.

  assumed to be local to the Unix host, either as part of the server's
  local passdb or in the local system list of accounts (e.g. /etc/passwd
  or /etc/group).

  If the member server is not running winbindd at all, domain

  The default mapping entries for groups such as "Domain Admins" are
  no longer created when using an smbpasswd file or a tdbsam passdb
  backend. Use 'net groupmap add' rather than 'net groupmap modify'
  to set these entries.

  A substring matching rule has been added to the sambaSID attribute
  definition. For OpenLDAP servers, this will require the addition
  of 'index sambaSID sub' to the slapd.conf configuration file. It
  will be necessary to run slapindex after making this change. There

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  Because portupgrade had a problem with detecting Berkley DB version 2
  or newer, and the default database format is now set to use these
  versions, you can end up with a portupgrade that does not work with
  older databases. A quick fix is to remove the databases, type:
  'rm /var/db/pkg/pkgdb.db /usr/ports/INDEX*.db'.
  portupgrade will recreate them automatically. It does absolutely no harm.

  If you do not want remove the databases, you should detect what database
  type do you use, and set the port options for portupgrade accordingly.
  Follow these instructions:

  - run 'pkgdb -fu' *before* upgrading and take a look on the output.
    You can see database format there as: format:XXX, where XXX is your
    current database format.
  - Go to portupgrade port directory and configure the port with
    `make config' command. If you have bdb_* format, then turn on the BDB4
    option. If you have bdb1_* format, then turn off BDB4 and turn on
    the BDB1 option. If you have dbd_hash format, then turn off all options.
  - Upgrade portupgrade.

  Note: if you change database format with changing port options,
  you should remove the ruby-bdb* port that you don't need anymore.
  Alternatively, you can hard code database format in your pkgtools.conf.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql-client
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  MySQL version 5.0 is now the default. If you have only the client
  port, you can upgrade all ports with:
    portupgrade -rfo databases/mysql50-client mysql-client

20060616:
  AFFECTS: users of all pfpro ports
  AUTHOR: aaron@FreeBSD.org

  The default certificate location has been changed to respect hier(7).
  The new default location is LOCALBASE/etc/pfpro/certs.

  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap22{,-sasl}-client
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP version 2.3 is now the default. To upgrade all ports do
    portupgrade -rfo net/openldap23-client openldap-client
  (or a similar command for the SASL variant). If you do not want to
  upgrade, add the line `WANT_OPENLDAP_VER?=22' to /etc/make.conf.

20060616:
  AFFECTS: users of emulation/linux_base-*
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  We now use Fedora Core 4 as the linux base port, and the corresponding
  xorg libs for the linux X11 libs port.

  To upgrade you have to run
	portupgrade -f -o emulators/linux_base-fc4 linux_base\*
	portupgrade -f -o x11/linux-xorg-libs linux-XFree86-libs

  You need to make sure that you have not changed the sysctl
  compat.linux.osrelease. FC4 behaves differently depending on the
  content of this sysctl. Only the default value of this sysctl is
  supported. In case of problems also revert to the default of the
  compat.linux.osname if changed.

  In case "printenv | grep LD_" prints something, e.g., LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  or LD_PRELOAD, you have to make sure it is not set when starting
  linux programs, else FreeBSD libraries will be picked up and the
  programs do not start.

  After this start a linux program to test, e.g., acroread. If you get
  errors when starting linux programs about problems with libraries, and
  you made sure no LD_* variable is set as described above, you are one of
  those unlucky people where we do not have a better solution as to tell
  you to deinstall every linux port, remove /compat/linux completely to
  make sure no cruft is left and reinstall everything you need.

  The USE_CDROM knob was renamed to WITH_CDROM for consistency
  within the ports tree.

20060611:
  AFFECTS: users of www/c-icap
  AUTHOR: b3k@mail.ru

  The format of file c-icap.magic has changed. If you use your own
  c-icap.magic file remember to convert it to the new format. It can be done
  using the convert_old_magic.pl script located in the contrib directory.

20060605:
  AFFECTS: users of net/kdenetwork3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The KDE multi-protocol instant messenger, Kopete, has been moved out
  of the net/kdenetwork3 port and is now available separately as
  net-im/kopete.

  AFFECTS: users of net/quagga
  AUTHOR: lawrance@FreeBSD.org

  As of version 0.99.4 quagga no longer supports UCD-SNMP v4. If you
  require this functionality, you should make alternative arrangements
  before upgrading quagga.

20060529:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/qmail-spamcontrol
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  Updated to version 2.4.14 that brings a lot of news, most significant is
  STARTTLS support on smtpd and pop3d, if you want to use it, you need to
  install sysutils/ucspi-ssl-tls port that has the necessary patch applied.

  Remember to select STDERR option and rebuild security/clamav port, this is
  necessary to have the correct log on smtpd.

  After upgrade from 2.3.x you will need to set environment var SMTPAUTH to
  enable auth, you can set it as "login" or "crammd5" to set which auth you
  want.

20060528:
  AFFECTS: users of news/inn
  AUTHOR: shaun@inerd.com

  The 2.4.3 port of inn has an unfortunate bug which causes inn's database files
  to be erased during an uninstall or upgrade. Earlier versions are also
  affected. The latest port revision fixes this, but before upgrading, users are
  advised to move their ${PREFIX}/news/db directory out of the way, in order to
  save the history, active and newsgroups databases from destruction.

20060526:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: gkovesdan@t-hosting.hu

  The Clamav project recommended that security/clamav and security/clamav-devel
  should depend on archivers/unzoo instead of zoo, and on archivers/arj instead
  of unarj. Because the clamav and clamav-devel ports are used quite often with
  amavisd-new, this port was modified to depend on the same two archiver ports
  as well. The amavisd-new port automatically recognizes arj, but not unzoo, so
  ${PREFIX}/etc/amavisd.conf should be modified. This line should be changed:
	  ['zoo',  \&do_zoo,         'zoo'],
  To this one:
	  ['zoo',  \&do_zoo,         ['zoo','unzoo'] ],

20060526:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap23-server
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The setting of SHELL backend has been inverted to off by default,
  because of the side effect it can cause. A new option, SLURPD
  has been added to give the user decision on whether the
  replication should be built and installed. Please note that the
  replication daemon is disabled when threading is disabled (e.g.
  when using shell backend), no matter what the user option SLURPD
  is set to.

  You are advised to do a "make config" in the net/openldap23-server
  directory *before* upgrading.

20060524:
  AFFECTS: users of games/spicetrade
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  To comply with the Porter's Handbook recommendations, spicetrade port no
  longer defines USE_X_PREFIX. Hence the executable used to launch the game has
  moved to ${PREFIX}/bin/spicetrade (was ${X11BASE}/bin/spicetrade).

20060524:
  AFFECTS: users of java/jasmin
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The executable has been renamed to 'jasmin' (was 'jasmin.sh')

           astro/boinc-setiathome-naparst, astro-boinc-setiathome
  AUTHOR: r.c.ladan@gmail.com

  As SETI@home doesn't generate work for 4.x clients anymore, the ports
  structure has been updated to use the 5.x client by default.
  People currently using any of the above ports should finish and report
  their existing work (both for normal and enhanced) and not allow any
  new work until after their ports are updated, to minimize loss of
  work.
  Note that this update changes the enhanced client to work for the
  normal instead of the beta project. When a beta client for Astropulse
  is released, it will work as the new client for the beta project.

20060518:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap23-server
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The OpenLDAP 2.3.x series now automatically disables threading when
  shell backend is enabled, as suggested by the OpenLDAP developers.
  Users should be aware of the change and choose whether to enable
  the feature.

20060516:
  AFFECTS: users of www/tinyproxy
  AUTHOR: wxs@csh.rit.edu

  tinyproxy now installs a rc.d script. To enable tinyproxy at boot
  time, set the following in rc.conf(5):
      tinyproxy_enable="YES"
  The configuration file for tinyproxy has been moved to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/tinyproxy.conf. Any old configuration files will need
  to be migrated over to the new location.

20060514:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/smartmontools, others
  AUTHOR: jylefort@FreeBSD.org

  In FreeBSD 6.1, the ata(4) device ABI has changed. After updating to
  FreeBSD 6.1, ports which access ATA drives directly
  (sysutils/smartmontools, others) must be rebuilt.

20060512:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail
  AUTHOR: barner@FreeBSD.org

  Fetchmail now has a rcNG script. It supports two modes:

   - one fetchmail instance per user: Set the `fetchmail_users'
     variable to a list of users for which you want to start
     fetchmail.
   - a global system wide daemon (runs per default as user
     `fetchmail')

  See $PREFIX/etc/rc.d/fetchmail for details.

  further informations about this change and how you can update your
  dhcpd.leases file.

20060506:
  AFFECTS: users of PHP
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The old PHP slave ports (phpN-cli, phpN-cgi and mod_phpN) were removed
  in favor of unified PHP ports that allow building any combination of
  PHP SAPIs (cli, cgi and apache module).
  The PHP CGI binary was renamed to php-cgi, so you should update
  the path in your script. To simplify the update process, *only* for
  this release a 'php' compatibility symlink to php-cgi will be created
  if you don't select the CLI SAPI.
  Before the upgrade you *should* run 'make config' in lang/php4 or
  lang/php5 to configure the SAPIs you want to install.
  As a consequence the default binary packages include the CLI and the
  FastCGI SAPIs.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/lua, editors/kile, x11/kdelibs3, x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: pav@FreeBSD.org, kde@FreeBSD.org

  Recently, the port of Lua was updated to version 5.1. This version is
  incompatible with the version 5.0, which is used in a number of applications,
  most notable in the Kile and Kate editors (the latter being part of a base
  KDE installation).

  If you're having troubles running those, such as error dialogs saying "Check
  your KDE installation", make sure to downgrade your lua installation back
  to 5.0:

  portupgrade -f -o lang/lua50 lua-5.1

20060501:
  AFFECTS: users of www/instiki
  AUTHOR: arsptr@optusnet.com.au

  The instiki port has changed storage methods to use an SQL database.
  The README contains instructions on how to migrate existing wiki data to the
  new storage methods. The following is a copy of the relevant information,
  tailored for FreeBSD port users:

  1. cd /usr/ports/www/instiki; make extract
  2. Execute
      ruby work/instiki-0.11.0/script/import_storage \
          -t /usr/local/instiki/storage/2500 \
          -i /usr/local/instiki \
          -d sqlite \
          -o [some location]/instiki_import.sql
  3. This will produce instiki_import.sql file in the specified location.
     Open it in a text editor and inspect carefully.
  4. Upgrade your instiki port normally (eg portupgrade)
  5. Connect to your production database, eg:
       sqlite3 /usr/local/instiki/db/production.db.sqlite3
     and have it execute instiki_import.sql, eg:
       .read [some location]/instiki_import.sql
  6. Execute
       ruby /usr/local/instiki/script/reset_references production
     (this script parses all pages for crosslinks between them, so it
     may take a few minutes)

20060418:
  AFFECTS: users of net/{ipw,iwi}-firmware
  AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  Some changes in the way ipw(4) and iwi(4) work lead to fundamental
  changes in ipw-firmware and iwi-firmware ports. Since these drivers
  are now using loadable kernel modules as firmware, two new ports have
  been created: net/ipw-firmware-kmod and net/iwi-firmware-kmod.

  You should not be able to install the wrong one since detection is
  based on your FreeBSD version. Trying to install the wrong port will
  result in an error message (port marked as IGNORE).

20060413:
  AFFECTS: users of security/tor-devel
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  The default data directory of tor-devel has been changed from
  /var/run/tor to /var/db/tor/data
  In order to keep your old server settings, you should either
  move the appropriate files to this directory manually,
  or set the tor_datadir variable accordingly in /etc/rc.conf

  AUTHOR: shaun@inerd.com

  The Horde ports no longer overwrite your existing configuration
  files during an upgrade: if you have modified any of the files in the
  config directory of any of these ports, they will be left untouched
  when you upgrade.

  It is recommended that the new .dist files are examined after an
  upgrade and any changes merged into your existing config files if
  necessary.

  bacula-server now installs two rc.d scripts, one for the Director
  and one for the Storage Daemon. To enable the Director at boot time,
  set the following in /etc/rc.conf[.local]:

  bacula_dir_enable="YES"

  To enable the Storage Daemon, set the following in rc.conf(5):

  bacula_sd_enable="YES"

  Similarly, bacula-client also installs a rcNG script. To enable
  the File Daemon at boot time, set the following in rc.conf(5):

  bacula_fd_enable="YES"

  The old z-bacula.sh script in PREFIX/etc/rc.d should be removed.

20060403:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db*
  AUTHOR: swhetzel@gmail.com

  Most of the ports that depend on Berkeley DB have been updated to use
  Mk/bsd.database.mk. Mk/bsd.database.mk is used to include MySQL, PostgreSQL,
  Berkeley DB, and SQLite in a port.

  The Berkeley DB support in Mk/bsd.database.mk is used to return the proper
  db* library name and location of the include and library directories of the
  requested version.

  To select a version of Berkeley DB, you can use either WITH_BDB_VER=<version>
  or ${UNIQUENAME}_WITH_BDB_VER=<version> (version is one of 3, 40, 41, 42, 43,
  or 44).

  When a port has USE_BDB defined as either 'USE_BDB=41+' or 'USE_BDB=yes', the
  port will use the oldest installed version of Berkeley DB. For example if
  both db41 and db43 are installed, the port would end up compiling with db41.
  If you add -DWITH_BDB_HIGHEST to your make command, the port will use highest
  db* instead. If no Berkeley DB is installed then the port will default to the
  version specified or the default Berkeley DB version (currently db41).

  NOTE: If a port was using a different variable to select Berkeley DB or a
  version, you will get an IGNORE message when you build the port. This
  message will tell you what you need to do.

  Port Maintainers please review the comments in Mk/bsd.database.mk on what
  variables are available for you use in your own ports.

20060331:
  AFFECTS: users of biology/emboss and biology/embassy
  AUTHOR: fernan@iib.unsam.edu.ar

  Since EMBOSS-3.0.0 both EMBOSS and EMBASSY install by default into
  $LOCALBASE/emboss to avoid conflicts with other ports.

  Users upgrading to 3.0.0 should take this into consideration when
  planning the upgrade, because it will involve moving data not
  installed by the port (databases) and tweaking the emboss.defaults
  config file.

  If you want to install the ports into $LOCALBASE (/usr/local, the old
  behavior), you can still do so by setting PREFIX manually. But you
  will have to take care of conflicting ports yourself.

20060330:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@freebsd.org

  The genkdmconf.sh rc-script has been removed in favor of a kdm wrapper
  script, which now handles both launching kdm and automatically updating or
  generating kdm's configuration files. The actual kdm binaries have been
  renamed to 'kdm-bin', 'kdm-bin_config' and 'kdm-bin_greet' respectively.

  These changes should be mostly transparent to kdm users and require no
  changes to existing configurations or setups, however: The actual kdm process
  is now also named 'kdm-bin', so 'killall kdm' will no longer work.

20060328:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nut
  AUTHOR: Joerg.Pulz@frm2.tum.de

  Beginning with nut-2.0.3 the nut rcNG script only starts the ups driver and
  the ups daemon 'upsd'.

  The ups monitor 'upsmon' and the ups logger 'upslog' are now handled by
  separate scripts to get more control over the different services.
  Please take a look into the nut, nut_upslog and nut_upsmon scripts
  installed in ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/ for possible rc.conf values and their
  defaults.

20060322:
  AFFECTS: users of security/dazuko

20060223:
  AFFECTS: all ports using libtool as part of the build process
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  The way in which ports that require libtool to build has been
  completely reworked to bring the ports system in line with other
  environments, such as Linux, and pkgsrc.

  devel/libtool13 no longer exists. devel/libtool15 has been modified
  to (a) install in the canonical locations and (b) remove a number
  of long-standing FreeBSD-specific patches that resulted in a very
  different libtool than is present on other systems.

  The main visible change will be that a large number of ports have
  had their plists modified (we now install libtool .la archives)
  and, as such, PORTREVISIONS have been bumped on ~2000 ports (roughly
  1/7th of the tree).

  Unfortunately, there is no simple upgrade path. Short of removing
  all packages and reinstalling from scratch, the only other viable
  alternative would be careful use of portupgrade. Given the large
  number of different ways in which libtool is used by other ports
  in the tree, this is a process that is likely to vary considerably
  from system to system, and as such, folks should be very mindful
  of running automatic updating software, such as portupgrade, making
  extensive use of the -n flag (and equivalents for other updaters)
  to see what will actually be rebuilt, before actually performing
  the upgrade.

  The good news is that the system now in place will make the handling
  of libtool-using ports considerably easier going forward.

20060221:
  AFFECTS: users of print/acroread7 and the localized versions
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  installation directory of print/acroread7 and the slave ports
  have been changed to ${PREFIX}/Adobe/Acrobat7.0/${ADOBE_LANG}.
  ${ADOBE_LANG} is one of CHS,CHT,DAN,DEU,ENU,ESP,FRA,ITA,JPN,KOR,
  NLD,NOR,PTB,SUO,SVE and represents language used in the UI (FRA means
  French version and it is installed by french/acroread, for example).
  To configure the UI language, navigate to Edit->Preferences->International->
  Application Language, set it to "Choose at application startup" and
  restart the program.

  The command filename is ${PREFIX}/bin/acroread as before (this is
  a script installed by print/acroreadwrapper now), and if multiple
  versions are installed, one of them will be selected according to
  ${ADOBE_LANG} environment variable. If ${ADOBE_LANG} is not set,
  it will be automatically set by using ${LANG}; this means when
  LANG=fr_FR.ISO8859-15, ADOBE_LANG will be FRA and the French version
  will be invoked by ${PREFIX}/bin/acroread. You can set ADOBE_LANG
  manually, too.

  Also, if you want to activate the PDF plugin, use --install-plugin
  option in ${PREFIX}/bin/acroread. For more detail, see
  print/acroreadwrapper/pkg-message.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/dcc-dccd
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The midnight dccm and dccifd system log message has been changed to disclose
  spam passed from whiteclnt-listed MX servers. MX servers should now be listed
  in /var/dcc/whiteclnt with lines like:
                mx      ip      10.2.3.4
                mx      ip      10.5.6.0/28
                mxdcc   ip      10.7.8.9
  "MX" marks the IP address of one of your mail systems that should be ignored
  in initial Received: headers and when reported by sendmail to dccm. "MXDCC"
  marks IP addresses of your mail systems that run DCC clients and that will have
  already reported mail to the DCC. Continue using "OK" whitelist entries for
  mail systems that you trust to never send or forward unsolicited bulk email.
  Allow custom DNS blacklist SMTP rejection messages. See -Bset:rej-msg=X in the
  dccifd and dccm man pages.

  AFFECTS: users of www/jakarta-tomcat4, www/jakarta-tomcat41,
           www/jakarta-tomcat5, www/jakarta-tomcat55, and www/tomcat55
  AUTHOR: lawrance@FreeBSD.org

  The Tomcat ports listed above have been converted to use new-style
  rc scripts. In order to enable Tomcat, you must add:

	tomcat{4,41,5,55}_enable="YES"

  to your rc.conf. Select the appropriate version number for your
  installation. When shutting down, the rc scripts will kill the
  Tomcat process after a default timeout of 10 seconds. This can be
  changed by setting the tomcatXX_stop_timeout variable in rc.conf.

  Tomcat 5.5 users please note that the rc variables have changed name
  from jakarta_tomcat55_* to tomcat55_*.

  The "tomcatctl" executable is no longer installed. Please use the
  rc scripts to control tomcat instead.

  /usr/local/etc/.

20060130:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portsnap
  AUTHOR: cperciva@FreeBSD.org

  Due to configuration file changes, users of portsnap are encouraged
  to copy the latest sample configuration file into place after updating
  portsnap to version 1.0:

  	# cd /usr/local/etc && cp portsnap.conf.sample portsnap.conf

20060126:
  AFFECTS: ports that use Display Postscript libraries and xorg-libraries
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  Support for Display Postscript has been deprecated in X.Org 6.9 release
  and libraries and tools are no longer installed by default. If you have
  installed a port that complains about missing libdpstk or libpsres, you
  need to reinstall it so it will be build without DPS support.

20060123:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/qmail, mail/qmail-ldap, mail/qmail-mysql,
           mail/qmail-spamcontrol, mail/qmail-tls and all dependant
           ports.
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  If you use qmail installed on a PREFIX different of /var/qmail,
  please, set a var on /etc/make.conf named QMAIL_PREFIX with this
  value. It'll be used for many ports that depends of qmail.

  To prevent stale dependencies, when you use one of qmail slave ports,
  now you just need to set a var named QMAIL_SLAVEPORT on /etc/make.conf
  assigning to it the name of slave port you are using.

  The valid options for now are:
  * ldap
  * mysql
  * spamcontrol
  * tls

20060114:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache13-ssl with suexec enabled.
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  for more details.

20060113:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/qvamps
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  Some program location pathnames have been corrected. Therefore,
  a new configuration file has to be generated. First, close qvamps.
  Then, remove the previous configuration file. Finally, start qvamps
  again. The configuration file can be removed with:

  $ rm ~/.qvamps/qvampsrc

20060112:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix, mail/postfix1, mail/postfix21,
		    mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: mnag@FreeBSD.org

  in etc/rc.d directory linked to sbin/postfix, please remove.
  Do not forget to add 'postfix_enable="YES"' in your rc.conf

20060112:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  gnutls has been updated to 1.2.9 and all shared libraries' versions
  have been bumped. So you need to rebuild all applications that
  depend on gnutls. Do something like:

	portupgrade -rf gnutls

20060111:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/lxdvdrip
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  lxdvdrip has been updated to version 1.51 depending on port
  multimedia/vamps. However, multimedia/vamps needs to know beforehand
  how many bytes will be processed in order to work. Unfortunately,
  lxdvdrip cannot provide such information. Therefore, vamps and
  playcell specific tailored versions shipped within the lxdvdrip
  distribution will be used. They will be named so that lxdvdrip
  does not conflict with multimedia/vamps. This is for lxdvdrip
  version 1.51_1.

  However, users that used lxdvdrip previously to this update, are
  required to modify their configuration file in order to comply
  to the new naming scheme.

  File: ~/.lxdvdrip.conf
  From: play_cell_name=play_cell
        vamps_name=vamps
  To:   play_cell_name=play_cell_lxdvdrip

  AFFECTS: users of devel/perforce
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Perforce has been updated to version 2005.2. As usual, there has
  been significant schema upgrades, so even though upgrading to
  2005.2 is straightforward, it is still highly recommended to
  follow the upgrading instructions in the release notes:

  the DRUPDIR variable to www/data/drupal.

20060109:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  All postgresql versions have been updated. These patch releases fix
  a problem with character string comparisons for locales that
  consider different character combinations as equal, such as
  Hungarian. This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on
  textual columns. Also, if plperl is used, a "REINDEX" might be
  required under certain conditions. Check the HISTORY file in the
  source for details.

20060108:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs3, x11/kdebase3, deskutils/superkaramba,
	            x11-themes/kde-windeco-smoothblend, irc/kvirc,
	            editors/vimpart
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  A number of files have been moved from kdebase to kdelibs between
  KDE 3.4.3 and KDE 3.5.0 and some applications which used to be
  distributed separately from KDE have been included in the release.

  This means that you will have to take some precautions in order to
  update your KDE installation without interruptions.

  We recommend sticking to the following procedure. This procedure requires you
  to have sysutils/portupgrade installed and to be the superuser (or using sudo).

  1.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

        pkg_deinstall -f kdebase-\[0-9\]\* superkaramba-\[0-9\]\* \
        kde-windeco-smoothblend-\[0-9]\* kvirc-\[0-9\]\* \
        kdeaddons-vimpart-\[0-9\]\*

  2.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

        portupgrade -O arts\* kde\* \*kde-i18n\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

        portupgrade -a

  3.) Reinstall the KDE ports you deleted in step 1.

        portinstall -O kdebase

  Superkaramba is now included in misc/kdeutils3.

  The smoothblend window decoration is now included in x11-themes/kdeartwork3.

  Vimpart is being discontinued and no longer part of KDE.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  =============

  Just like KDE 3.4, KDE 3.5 does not play nice with openssl-0.9.8. In
  particular it breaks kwallet, some of the SSL handling in konqueror and
  SSL/TLS support in kmail/kontact.

  If you're using the openssl ports rather than the base-system openssl,
  make sure to use security/openssl-stable.

  You can put WITH_OPENSSL_STABLE=yes into /etc/make.conf to automatically
  make ports depend on that rather than on security/openssl.

  FreeBSD 4.x users MUST install openssl-stable even if the base openssl is
  present for SSL/TLS support in kmail/kontact to work. Unfortunately, the
  kdepim3 port cannot depend on it automatically due to shortcomings/bugs in
  ports-collection's openssl infrastructure.

20060106:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kronolith <= 2.0.6 with MCAL backend
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  Beginning with release 2.1, the support of MCAL will be removed
  from Kronolith. To prepare your migration, you can already switch
  to a SQL back-end, with the script provided at
  /usr/local/www/horde/kronolith/scripts/migrate_to_sql_driver.php.

20060105:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail >= 6.3.0
  AUTHOR: barner@FreeBSD.org

  Beginning with release 6.3.0, fetchmail not only needs write
  access to the idfile ($HOME/.fetchids), but also to the directory
  holding this file. For end users running fetchmail with default
  idfile on their own account, nothing changes: they have write
  access to their home directory.

20060105:
  AFFECTS: users of www/wwwoffle, security/ipsec-tools
  AUTHOR: edwin@FreeBSD.org

  The startup of the rc.d scripts for these two ports are now
  by default disabled.

20051228:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/tovid
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  tovid shell scripts relies heavily on bash(1) but the previous
  port version tried to use sh(1). However, since there were too
  many complications, the port now depends on shells/bash.

  Due to this change, the configuration files need to be regenerated.
  Please, erase all previous configuration files. The configuration
  file samples will be generated on the 1st invocation of the
  scripts.

  $ rm ~/.tovid/*

20051228:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/scponly
  AUTHOR: rushani@FreeBSD.org

  From scponly 4.2, scp & WinSCP compatibilities are not enabled by default.
  To enable those compatibilities, define WITH_SCPONLY_SCP and/or
  WITH_SCPONLY_WINSCP, respectively.

20051225:
  AFFECTS: users of p5-libapreq2
  AUTHOR: vanilla@FreeBSD.org

  libapreq2 can be pure c library, I believe some people need pure c library,
  but hate mod_perl, so I split it to 2 ports, and set libapreq2 as
  p5-libapreq2's master ports.

  If you need pure library of libapreq2, install www/libapreq2.
  If you like mod_perl & enjoy p5-libapreq2, install/www/p5-libapreq2.

20051213:
  AFFECTS: users of pear ports
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  A few old pear ports have been removed from the tree in favor of a
  single devel/pear port. If portupgrade complains about missing ports,
  you may safely remove pear-XML_RPC, pear-Console_Getopt, pear-Archive_Tar
  and php[45]-pear and then run:

  portupgrade -o devel/pear -f pear-PEAR

20051212:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ntop
  AUTHOR: wxs@csh.rit.edu

  ntop now installs a rcNG script. It also logs to syslog by default.
  To enable ntop at boot time, set the following in rc.conf(5):

  ntop_enable="YES"

20051210:
  AFFECTS: users of net/mldonkey-devel
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  MLDonkey port net/mldonkey-devel has been patched to work with
  the updated lang/ocaml version 3.09. As a result, ocaml 3.09
  is now a requirement. You have to follow the instructions for
  updating your complete ocaml installation outlined below on
  20051201 by burelle@lri.fr.

  If you use the command below, everything should be fine.

  $ portupgrade -fr 'ocaml*' 'mldonkey-*devel*'

20051210:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail using SSL encryption
  AUTHOR: barner@FreeBSD.org

  Fetchmail now checks the validity of server certificates and complains
  verbosely in maillog if the validation fails.

  If your mail server's certificate is not signed by one of the root
  authorities, you have to manually configure them using the following steps:

    * Download the necessary certificates in PEM format and store them
      at a suitable location, e.g. /home/user/.certs

    * Run the c_rehash tool on the freshly installed certificates:

      - If you are using OpenSSL from the base system (this is the default)
        use the following command:
	% perl /usr/src/crypto/openssl/tools/c_rehash /home/user/.certs

      - If you are using OpenSSL from security/openssl please use
        % c_rehash /home/user/.certs

    * Use the following options to enable SSL encryption in your .fetchmailrc
      configuration file:

      options ssl sslcertpath /home/user/.certs sslcertck
              sslfingerprint '< fingerprint >'
	      < other options >

  AFFECTS: users of security/racoon and security/ipsec-tools
  AUTHOR: lawrance@FreeBSD.org

  security/racoon has been removed. You should migrate to its
  replacement, security/ipsec-tools. No configuration changes will
  be required.

  The default configuration file location has changed for ipsec-tools.
  You will need to move your racoon configuration files to the new
  location /usr/local/etc/racoon. Alternatively, add this line in
  rc.conf to continue using the old location:

  racoon_flags="-f /usr/local/etc"

20051201:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ocaml
  AUTHOR: burelle@lri.fr

  Upgrade to 3.09.0 will break binary compatibility at link time, so any

  usable (standalone binaries do not require rebuild since they are
  statically linked.)

20051129:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/monotone
  AUTHOR: lapo@lapo.it

  Keys are now stored in ~/.monotone/keys/.
  You must run 'db migrate' against each of your databases;
  this will automatically migrate the keys.
  Command line syntax for 'serve' has changed; please adjust
  startup scripts accordingly.

  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  A change has been committed against www/lighttpd, which flips the
  meaning of the IPV6 option to match other ports, along with the
  1.4.7 upgrade. If you have previously saved configuration that
  checks the IPV6 option (meaning to disable IPv6), then you will
  have to rerun the configuration with ``make config''.

  The default setting for IPV6 build is kept, which was enabled by
  default.

  The Trac database schema was changed between versions 0.8 and 0.9. This
  port also started to use PySQLite 2 (SQLite 3). Existing environments
  must be upgraded before they can be used with Trac 0.9.

  The canonical update procedure for existing trac environments is:

  $ export TRAC_ENV=/path/to/trac/env
  $ # backup existing trac environment
  $ cp -Rp $TRAC_ENV $TRAC_ENV.backup # backup existing trac env
  $ # convert database from sqlite 2 to sqlite 3 format

  AFFECTS: users of devel/apache-ant
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The Ant launcher script now uses javavmwrapper to pick a suitable JDK. Hence
  it is no longer needed to define JAVA_HOME for Ant to run. You may rather use
  and combination of JAVA_VERSION, JAVA_OS and JAVA_VENDOR. See javavm(1) for
  further information. However, you may still override this behavior using
  JAVACMD.

  The ANT_INCLUDE_SHARED_JARS variable used to be effective only when set to

  Now version 1.0.4 of libspf2 has repo copied from mail/libspf2 to
  mail/libspf2-10 and mail/libspf2 has updated to 1.2.5.
  mail/exim depends on mail/libspf2 and mail/postfix, mail/postfix21
  and mail/postfix-policyd-spf depends on mail/libspf2-10.

  sql_DB_layout.conf-sample: includes changes needed for the new "username" SQL
  field; if you update to 1.7.8 YOU MUST update this file too if you have your
  accounts on SQL

  bnetd.conf-sample: changed "servaddrs" directive to not be totally commented
  and be as ":" by default in bnetd.conf (if "servaddrs" is commented this
  means "bnetd" will not listen for b.net services at all)

20050902:
  AFFECTS: users of www/jakarta-tomcat55
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The port installs a new RCng startup script which no longer uses tomcat55ctl to
  control the Tomcat daemon. Furthermore, the behavior of Tomcat may be
  configured through switches and variables from /etc/rc.conf. They are
  documented in the header of the RCng script:

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/kdeadmin3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  One data file has been moved from kdeadmin to kdelibs between
  KDE 3.4.1 and KDE 3.4.2. This means that

  *********if you currently have the kdeadmin port installed*********

  you will have to take some precautions to update your KDE
  installation.

  We recommend sticking to the following procedure. This procedure requires you
  to have sysutils/portupgrade installed and to be the superuser (or using sudo).

  1.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

        pkg_deinstall -f kdeadmin-\[0-9\]\*

  2.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

        portupgrade -O arts\* kde\* \*kde-i18n\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

        portupgrade -a

  3.) Reinstall the KDE ports you deleted in step 1.

        portinstall -O kdeadmin

20050728:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/sge and sysutils/sgeee
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  A port of SGE 6 has been installed in sysutils/sge. SGE 6 is
  significantly different from SGE 5 and an upgrade is only possible
  by removing the SGE 5 install and replacing it. The SGE vs SGEEE
  distinction has been removed in SGE 6 so the sgeee port was removed.
  The sge and sgeee ports were repo copied to sge53 and sgeee53
  respectively and existing installations may continue to use them.

20050727:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/firebird-server
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  Changes in layout:
  * database directory has changed from /usr/local/firebird to /var/db/firebird
  * configuration files are placed in /usr/local/etc/firebird
  * common utilities have been moved to /usr/local/bin
  * suid-ed binaries have been moved to /usr/local/sbin

  Update inetd.conf/xinetd.conf to reflect new location of "fb_inet_server".

20050722:
  AFFECTS: all RELENG_6 and HEAD users of ports/packages, maintainers
	   of ports that interact with the compat libraries.
  AUTHOR: kensmith@FreeBSD.org

  The shared library version number of all shared libraries built as
  part of the baseline system has been incremented in both RELENG_6
  and HEAD. The overall goal is to make handling of the compat library
  infrastructure easier. Each new release branch will have different
  version numbers for all of the shared libraries and the compat ports
  can simply include all of the shared libraries from the previous
  release.

  If you update your system using normal cvsup/rebuild/reinstall
  mechanisms the old versions of the libraries will still be on your
  system so your old ports executables will continue to work.
  But you definitely should plan on recompiling and reinstalling all
  of your installed ports so they get relinked against the new libraries.
  If you don't take this step as time goes on "normal" updates and
  installs run the risk of having executables relying on both the new
  and old versions of the libraries which would cause big problems.

  It will take some time for the pre-built packages available on the
  FTP mirror sites to be rebuilt against the new libraries. If you
  want to update your ports using the pre-built packages watch the
  mailing lists for when the rebuilt packages become available.

  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/qt33, x11/kdelibs3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you have compiled qt33 with the KDE_OPTIONS option checked (if your
  installed qt-package is called qt-copy-3.3.4 instead of qt-3.3.4, check
  with pkg_info), you should cvsup and recompile qt33 and everything
  depending on it:

  portupgrade -rf qt\*

  Previous versions of the qt33 port contained a patch that
  introduces binary incompatibility between unpatched qt33 and software
  compiled against a patched qt33.

  Symptoms of the binary incompatibility: Unresolved symbol warnings from
  various KDE/Qt applications (both during runtime or compiling/linking),
  "Could not start kdeinit" dialogs during KDE startup, kicker crashes during
  exiting KDE.

20050630:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  Due to several complaints, new (unsupported) option had been added to port
  Makefile: WITH_LEGACY_GPU_SUPPORT. Starting with version 7667, NVidia has
  dropped support for numerous "legacy" GPUs, while this option allows to go
  with previous version of driver (this does not apply to older versions of
  FreeBSD, since you have to use version 6113 of driver (if you did not yet
  upgraded to FreeBSD 5.3 or later) which has support for those GPUs).

  If you must use WITH_LEGACY_GPU_SUPPORT option, be sure to ``hold'' the
  package by making appropriate entry in your pkgtools.conf, otherwise
  portupgrade(1) will upgrade your port to latest NVidia release on the
  next run, which is probably not what you want.

  Refer to x11/nvidia-driver/Makefile for further details.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 has been updated to 5.8.7. You should update everything
  depending on perl. The easiest way to do that is to use
  perl-after-upgrade script supplied with lang/perl5.8. Please see
  its manual page for details.

20050622:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd-*
  AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  ProFTPd binary moved from ${PREFIX}/libexec to ${PREFIX}/sbin. People
  using proftpd with inetd must use ${PREFIX}/sbin/in.proftpd (or
  ${PREFIX}/sbin/proftpd which is just the same). Read the commit log
  and diffs for more information.

20050621:
  AFFECTS: users of net/cacti
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  Because of users need to keep their DB configuration but config.php
  can't be saved on upgrading, I've moved DB settings in db-settings.php.
  So, you need to change db-settings.php and do not touch config.php
  anymore.

20050618:
  AFFECTS: users of alternate linux_base ports
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The Ports Collection now allows to override the default linux_base port.
  Specify e.g. OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=rh-9 in /etc/make.conf to use
  ${PORTSDIR}/emulators/linux_base-rh-9 (the logic is to use
  ${PORTSDIR}/emulators/linux_base-${OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT}).

20050610:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/wget built with SSL (default)
  AUTHOR: sf@FreeBSD.org

  wget 1.10 now authenticates certificate of remote host before making a
  SSL connection. To make it work, you should have working CA root
  certificates list in /etc/ssl/cert.pem.

  If you don't have it there are options:
  a) install security/ca-roots port and you have done.
  b) install ftp/curl port and symlink it to /etc/ssl/cert.pem.
      ln -s /usr/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  c) put your favorite one into certain place.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/sylpheed-claws
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  Sylpheed-claws is updated to the GTK2 version now. This results in a new
  configuration directory. To keep your configuration from the GTK1 version
  you can
      cp -rp ~/.sylpheed .sylpheed-gtk2
  before starting the GTK2 version for the first time, or
      cp -Rp ~/.sylpheed .sylpheed-gtk2/
  when you have run the GTK2 version already.

20050524:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mpeg4ip and multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with version 1.3 mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 installs libmp4av that mpeg4ip
  previously installed. It is advised to de-install mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 and
  mpeg4ip before updating to mpeg4ip-1.3 or mpeg4ip-libmp4v2-1.3. If you
  have already updated mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 and mpeg4ip you should deinstall
  mpeg4ip and reinstall mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 before updating mpeg4ip.

  This does not affect users who just have mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 installed
  and not mpeg4ip.

  The following has been changed in the bnetd.conf file (starting with
  version 1.7.7):
    - The old config variable `servername' has been renamed to `hostname'.
    - A new `servername' config variable has been introduced for server
      identification.

20050517:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_perl2 and all ports depending on it
  AUTHOR: lars.eggert@gmx.net.

  API changed for mod_perl2 - existing code will break!
  The mod_perl2 developers have significantly changed the API
  in release candidate 2.0.0-RC5. These changes include changed
  names for core packages, causing software that uses the old API
  to fail with the new version. You need to update your code as
  described in http://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/rename.html

20050517:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/firebird
  AUTHOR: freebsd@galle.com.br

  The port was split into a -server and -client parts.
  The -server contains server binary, UDFs, and install all in
  ${PREFIX}/firebird. The -client contains libs, includes,
  client binaries, docs and examples. For migration delete
  the firebird port and install the -server and/or -client port
  afterwards.

20050512:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/svk
  AUTHOR: rafan@infor.org

  Since SVK 0.30, it is fast enough and PPerl causes some problems.
  Thus, the SVK port no longer supports WITH_PPERL knob.
  If you still want to use PPerl with it, please go and read:

  # pkg_deinstall multimedia/ffmpeg

  Furthermore, video capture is no longer working in the latest
  version. Work is been done to overcome this.

20050511:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-(server|contrib)
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL ports have been updated to latest versions. A
  security problem in the template database requires a simple SQL
  command to be run on each database. Because these problems are
  really incorrect system catalog entries, updating to a new release
  will NOT by itself solve the problems in an existing
  installation.

  See http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.315 for details.

20050501:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ocaml based applications and libraries
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  With the recent update of ocaml to 3.08.3 some API compatibility
  has been broken. It is a bit subtle so that some users might not
  notice it. However, updating all ocaml based applications and

  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-authlib
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  mail/courier-authlib has been moved to security/courier-authlib and is
  now only a meta-port. Installing the meta-port installs security/
  courier-authlib-base and no, one or more sub-ports regarding to what
  authentication methods you've chosen. Courier-authlib-base only
  provides you authentication via PAM. All ports depending on courier-

  Opera 8.0 final has been released and can be installed by installing the
  www/opera port. The opera-devel port is now deprecated. If you want

  issue this command:

	# mv ~/.opera-devel ~/.opera

20050421:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera
  AUTHOR: avleeuwen@piwebs.com

  Opera has been updated to 8.0. If are upgrading from version 7.x or
  below, it is recommend that you backup your personal "~/.opera"
  directory and remove it, like this:

        # cp -Rp ~/.opera ~/.opera-bak
        # rm -rf ~/.opera/*

  After that, you can put your bookmarks, email, contacts, etc. back in
  ~/.opera/. The most important files are your bookmarks
  (~/.opera/opera6.adr) and your emails (~/.opera/mail). It is not a good
  idea to put opera6.ini, userstyle.ini, search.ini, pluginpath.ini and other
  non-personal stuff back in ~/.opera/. If you need custom settings,
  reconfigure Opera from the preferences pane or edit the files by hand.

  directory and remove it. It can be done following from the command line:

	# cp -Rp ~/.linux-opera ~/.linux-opera-bak
	# rm -rf ~/.linux-opera/*

  After that, you can put your bookmark, email, contacts and etc back in
  ~/.linux-opera/. The bookmark is ~/.linux-opera/opera6.adr and the email is
  ~/.linux-opera/mail as you can figure out by view in ~/.linux-opera/. It is
  probably not good idea to put opera6.ini, userstyle.ini, search.ini,
  pluginpath.ini and other non-personal stuff back in ~/.linux-opera/. The
  non-personal stuff should be re-configure on new stuff by either Opera
  preferences in GUI or hand (manual) in your editor.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL ports are updated to 8.0.2. All shared libraries'
  versions have been bumped, so you will need to recompile all client

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql50-server
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The base database directory can now be set and changed in rc.conf (default:
  /var/db/mysql). If you used to set DB_DIR to a different value during port
  compilation, you must specify it via the new "mysql_dbdir" rc variable.
  In addition, the "mysqllimits_enable" and "mysqllimits_args" variables

  You can also pass flags to tac_plus by setting the rc.conf variable
  tac_plus_flags. The default flags are "-C ${PREFIX}/etc/tac_plus.conf".

  Additionally, the default version of IOS for tac_plus has been changed from
  11.x to 12.x.

20050324:
  AFFECTS: users of net/mDNSResponder

	multimedia/kdemultimedia3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  In KDE 3.4, a number of files were moved between ports, some ports
  were added, one port has been removed and some applications formerly available
  in their own ports were incorporated into KDE. This means that you will have
  to take some precautions to update your KDE installation. A simple
  portupgrade -a will not work.

  Portupgrade -R kde can fail as well, depending on what parts of KDE you
  have currently installed. We therefore recommend sticking to the following
  procedure. The procedure requires you to have sysutils/portupgrade installed
  and you to be the superuser (or using sudo). We recommend not being logged in
  to a KDE session on the machine you're performing the upgrade on. If you
  choose to perform the update while being logged in to KDE, expect erratic
  behavior and crashes from applications launched until you log out and back
  in.

  1.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

      	pkg_deinstall -f kdeartwork-\[0-9\]\* kdebase-\[0-9\]\* \
	kdebase-konqueror-nsplugins-\[0-9\]\* kdewebdev-\[0-9\]\* \
	kde-\[0-9\]\* akregator\* phase\*

  2.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

      	portupgrade -O arts\* kde\* \*kde-i18n\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

      	portupgrade -a

  3.) Reinstall the KDE ports you deleted in step 1.

      	portinstall -O kdebase kdeartwork kdewebdev

   Changes in detail:

	- www/akregator is now included into deskutils/kdepim3.
	- x11-themes/phase is now included in x11-themes/kdeartwork3.
	- www/konqueror-nsplugins has been removed and is now integrated into
          x11/kdebase3.
	- Juk has been split out of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 and is now
          available as audio/juk.
	- Akode has been split out of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 and is now
          available as audio/akode and audio/akode-plugins-*. Akode is also
	  a default dependency of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 now.
	- audio/mpeglib_artsplug has been demoted to legacy status and is no
          longer the default decoder backend for kdemultimedia3. It's also not
          depended on by kdemultimedia3 by default anymore.

  Known post-updating issues:

  - If you're missing acoustic notifications (system sounds) after the update:

    	rm ~/.kde/share/config/knotifyrc

    Then log out of KDE and back in again (also see
    http://freebsd.kde.org/faq.php#q16).

  - kdm users might get warnings from kdm about obsolete lines in kdmrc.
    You can migrate your configuration while preserving your customizations
    by running (as root or with sudo)

    	genkdmconf

    Make sure to backup your old kdm configuration (usually found in
    /usr/local/share/config/kdm) beforehand in case the merge produces an
    invalid configuration. Especially note that kdm does not use the Xservers
    file anymore. A genkdmconf run will merge its contents into kdmrc.

  AUTHOR: cperciva@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of shifting from SHA-1 to SHA-256, the structure of
  portsnap's configuration file and compressed snapshot have both
  changed. After upgrading to portsnap 0.9, you will have to
  update your configuration file ($PREFIX/etc/portsnap.conf) and
  delete your existing portsnap compressed snapshot:

  	# cd /usr/local/etc && cp portsnap.conf.sample portsnap.conf
  	# rm -r /usr/local/portsnap/*

  In addition, be aware that the next runs of "portsnap fetch" and
  "portsnap update" will take far longer than usual, since they

  /var/db/mysql). If you used to set DB_DIR to a different value during port
  compilation, you must specify it via the new "mysql_dbdir" rc variable.
  In addition, the "mysqllimits_enable" and "mysqllimits_args" variables
  have been replaced by "mysql_limits" for consistency.

  AFFECTS: users of games/netpanzerdata, games/netpanzer
  AUTHOR: mad@madpilot.net

  The netpanzerdata port has changed it's name to netpanzer-data,
  so before installing the new one you will need to remove the old
  netpanzerdata-0.1.3 port.

  AFFECTS: all users who have glib/gtk/gnome libraries installed
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org and the FreeBSD GNOME team

  Gnome has been upgraded to 2.10 and gtk/glib to 2.6.
  DO NOT USE portupgrade(1) to update any gnome or gtk
  or any port that depends on them. Using portupgrade
  will cause problems and you will have to manually
  upgrade ports. Please use the gnome_upgrade.sh
  script from
    http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/gnome_upgrade.sh

20050309:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/maildrop
  AUTHOR: sergei@FreeBSD.org

  maildrop has been recently upgraded to 1.8.0. This version
  has the following changes:

  - Maildir quota is now enabled by default.
    The following options were deleted:
    - WITH_MAILDIRQUOTA
    - WITH_TRASHQUOTA
  - New option WITH_AUTHLIB is added, which provides optional support for
    Courier Auth Library (mail/courier-authlib port).
  - Userdb authentication, LDAP and MySQL support are provided through
    courier-authlib now, thus the following options
    - WITH_USERDB
    - WITH_LDAP
    - WITH_MYSQL
    have been superseded by WITH_AUTHLIB.

20050306:
  AFFECTS: users of math/ploticus
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  ploticus is now installed as bin/ploticus rather than bin/pl to
  avoid useless conflicts with other ports.

20050303:
  AFFECTS: users of net/i2p
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  The newest i2p version 0.5.0.1 is incompatible with all previous
  versions. Follow these procedures if you are updating from a
  previous port version. You can ignore these if you are installing
  i2p for the first time.

  1) Update i2p port to the new one
  2) Use the i2prouter script to uninstall i2p from user account.
     You are going to lose all your configuration.

  $ i2prouter uninstall

  3) Install the new i2p version

  $ i2prouter install

20050301:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ganglia-monitor-core
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  With the move to Ganglia 3.0.0, the configuration file for gmond has
  changed completely. The -r or --convert options may be used to
  emit a file in the new format given one in the old.

  Startup is now controlled by an RC_SUBR script so the gmond_enable and
  gmetad_enable variables will need to be set for gmond and gmetad to be
  started. Existing gmond.sh and gmetad.sh scripts in PREFIX/etc/rc.d
  should be removed.

  Due to a bug in ganglia's build process, the previous version may need
  to be removed before ganglia can be upgraded.

20050224:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby18 and any apps that depend on ruby18
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The theads support has been disabled again. It causes the more trouble, so
  it now builds with ${PTHREAD_CFLAGS} and ${PTHREAD_LIBS}. It is recommend
  you to rebuild any apps that depend on lang/ruby18. Do something like this:

  	portupgrade -rf ruby-1.8.2\*

20050224:

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nagios
  AUTHOR: blaz@si.FreeBSD.org

  Nagios has been upgraded to 2.0.b2. Native support for storing various types
  of data (status, retention, comment, downtime, etc.) in MySQL and PostgreSQL
  has been dropped. There are also multiple changes to the format of
  configuration files. Carefully read
  http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/2_0/whatsnew.html before upgrading.

20050213:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX-*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/teTeX-* are now based on teTeX 3.0. Although some
  reliability fixes are also added, here are several common problems
  which you might fall on.

  1) $PREFIX/bin/pdftex is missing:

   Probably your system has old files included teTeX 2.x which can
   prevent the new version from working. Please remove the old
   files first (see 20050206 in this file) and reinstall.

  2) Some formats are still corrupted (for example, "Fatal format file error;
     I'm stymied" is displayed) or not updated even after a clean install:

   You might have old or corrupted *.fmt and/or *.map files
   under /root/.texmf-* or $HOME/.texmf-* directories. Typically
   these directories are generated when you invoke the updmap(1),
   texconfig(1), or fmtutil(1) utility manually. However, for a period
   after the first revision of the teTeX-base port erroneously used
   fmtutil(1) to regenerate *.fmt files, you could have these directories
   without your intent. In such a case, please remove these directories
   and reinstall the ports (it is not needed to rebuild ports/packages).
   Just for your information, $HOME/.texmf-config and $HOME/.texmf-var
   can be used for your personal configuration.

  If you have other problems, please contact hrs@FreeBSD.org.

  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/mkbold, x11-fonts/mkitalic, and
	x11-fonts/mkbold-mkitalic
  AUTHOR: koma2@ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp

  The dependency on x11-fonts/mkbold and x11-fonts/mkitalic has been
  switched over to x11-fonts/mkbold-mkitalic, which is written in C
  and has far better performance than the old ones. There is no
  functional difference between the two, but they will conflict with
  each other. Since other ports which depend on x11-fonts/mkbold or
  x11-fonts/mkitalic will be updated to depend on x11-fonts/mkbold-mkitalic,
  you might get an error during upgrading such ports. In such a case,
  please pkg_delete the old ones first.

20050206:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX and japanese/teTeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/teTeX is now based on a teTeX 3.0 release candidate
  (2.99.13.20050204) and the other related ports are also updated.
  Since upgrading from previous versions should be done at a time,
  you may want to use the portupgrade utility or reinstall
  print/teTeX after deinstalling all of the related ports.

  If your teTeX environment became broken during the upgrade,
  please see the following URL which explains how to fix it.

  http://people.freebsd.org/~hrs/tetex-upgrade.txt

  This file also includes notes for people who are familiar
  with the teTeX distribution to explain structure of the ports.

20050205:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby16_r, lang/ruby18_r, and lang/ruby18
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  The slippery pthread support for systems prior to 502102 has been
  dropped and lang/ruby16_r and lang/ruby18_r ports have been removed,
  since no one seems to appreciate the partially working solution.

  Good news is that the pthread support of lang/ruby18 is now enabled
  by default for newer systems, which means the ruby interpreter is
  linked with libpthread. This will allow threaded extension
  libraries to run and work properly on those systems.

20050201:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5 and lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5 has been updated to 5.6.2, and lang/perl5.8 has been
  updated to 5.8.6. you should update everything depending on perl, that
  is:

    * first, upgrade your perl installation (use either lang/perl5 or
      lang/perl5.8, the latter being recommended);
    * for FreeBSD 4.X, run "use.perl port", so that the system knows you
      have 5.8.6 or 5.6.2; this step is not needed on FreeBSD 5.X and
      FreeBSD -CURRENT;
    * run some magic incantations to upgrade all ports depending on perl,
      that is run something like :
      portupgrade -f `(pkg_info -R perl-5\* |tail +4; \
        find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.[68].[1245] -type f -print0 \
        | xargs -0 pkg_which -fv | sed -e '/: ?/d' -e 's/.*: //')|sort -u`
      This is likely to fail for a few ports, you'll have to upgrade them
      afterwards by hand.

  AFFECTS: users of PostgreSQL
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  Each of the PostgreSQL ports have been split into a server and a
  client part. Please use postgresqlNN-server and/or
  postgresqlNN-client as needed. Versions currently supported are 7.3,
  7.4 and 8.0.

  To start the PostgreSQL server at boot time, add the following to
  /etc/rc.conf:

  postgresql_enable=yes

  The maintenance script is installed in etc/periodic/daily, and is
  controlled by a set of new knobs in periodic.conf. Use it for
  vacuuming your databases and get daily backups. Note that daily
  vacuuming is on by default. See the script for details.

  AFFECTS: users of net/howl
  AUTHOR: marcus@FreeBSD.org

  Howl now installs an rcNG script for starting mDNSResponder. To enable
  mDNSResponder to start at boot time, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

  mdnsresponder_enable="YES"

  You can also pass flags to mDNSResponder by setting the rc.conf variable
  mdnsresponder_flags to the appropriate value. See the mDNSResponder(8)
  man page for the list of supported flags. The default is not to pass
  any flags to mDNSResponder.

  If you use Xorg 6.8.1: Make sure there is an /tmp/.ICE-unix with propper
  rights. For further informations about that, please refer to 20041229
  Please update all your plugins as well when you update from 4.0.6 to 4.2
  They all need recompiling to link against the new xfce libraries

20050122:
  AFFECTS: users of PostgreSQL
  AUTHOR: seanc@FreeBSD.org

  The -devel port has been updated to contain 8.0 release since
  postgresql80-server can not be updated until 4.11 is released and the
  changes in PR ports/75344 are committed. Users who need 8.0 now can
  use the -devel port, however, once postgresql80-server has been
  committed, -devel will begin tracking 8.1. Please be smart about
  tracking ports and if used in production, update to
  databases/postgresql80-server as soon as it becomes available. No
  dump/reload will be required when changing from -devel to
  postgresql80-server.

20050114:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libgnomesu, esp. on FreeBSD 4.x.
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  If you installed libgnomesu the day it was added to the ports tree,
  you have a malformed PAM control file in /etc/pam.d/. All libgnomesu
  users should remove /etc/pam.d/gnomesu-pam, and 5.x users should
  replace it with the version in the updated libgnomesu port (ensure
  that you're using the most current revision of the libgnomesu port).

  4.x users: listen up! The presence of the /etc/pam.d/ directory (and
  anything in that directory) presents a Very Bad Thing. Unless you've
  manually tweaked your PAM settings, you must run:

  	# rm /etc/pam.d/gnomesu-pam
  	# rmdir /etc/pam.d/

  or all users will be locked out of your system!

20050110:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/iip
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  iip has been updated to the new network servers. Therefore, both
  old configuration files and node reference keys no longer apply.

  Therefore, you need to update the configuration files for each
  user running the iip isproxy daemon:

  1) Backup configuration files

  cp ~/.iip/isproxy.ini ~/.iip/isproxy.ini.backup
  cp ~/.iip/node.ref ~/.iip/node.ref.backup

  2) Remove configuration files

  rm ~/.iip/isproxy.ini
  rm ~/.iip/node.ref

  3) Create new configuration. Fill information as requested. This
  creates the updated isproxy.ini file

  isproxy -C

  4) Start iip isproxy. This will initialize your updated node.ref
  file. This file will be automatically updated when you connect
  to the iip network

  isproxy

20050110:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nautilus-cd-burner
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Nautilus-cd-burner now requires cdrtools built with UTF-8 encoding
  support. The default sysutils/cdrtools port does not support this
  encoding, and that will cause nautilus-cd-burner to enter an infinite
  loop when trying to create CD images. To workaround this, the cdrtools
  dependency was changed in nautilus-cd-burner to point to the
  sysutils/cdrtools-cjk port instead.

  Since sysutils/cdrtools and sysutils/cdrtools-cjk conflict, you must
  uninstall cdrtools so that the nautilus-cd-burner update can properly
  pull in cdrtools-cjk.

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap, mail/sqwebmail
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  Courier-imap and sqwebmail are now dependent on courier-authlib. If
  you've changed the default authentication config for courier-imap or
  sqwebmail, you will have to redo the changes for courier-authlib.
  You may wish to deinstall courier-imap and/or sqwebmail before you
  install courier-authlib. Since courier-authlib replaces parts of both
  ports, some of courier-authlib's files are listed as sqwebmail and
  courier-imap files and deinstalling old courier-imap and/or sqwebmail
  port may cause the deinstallation of the freshly installed
  courier-authlib files.

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sqwebmail
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  Sqwebmail now installs it's files directly under PREFIX. That means for
  instance that files that were formerly found under
  PREFIX/share/sqwebmail/etc/ are now located under PREFIX/etc/sqwebmail.
  Furthermore you need to set sqwebmaild_enable=YES in your rc.conf
  because the rc.d script has been migrated to use the rc.subr Subsystem

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  The variable courier_imap_imapdssl_enable have been renamed to
  courier_imap_imapd_ssl_enable.
  The variable courier_imap_pop3dssl_enable have been renamed to

  AFFECTS: users of the linux compatibility environment
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The default linux_base was changed from v7 to v8. You need to update from
  v7 to v8 and rebuild every linux port. To update run:
	portupgrade -rf -o emulators/linux_base-8 emulators/linux_base

  In case you already use linux_base-8 you have to run:
	portupgrade -rf emulators/linux_base-8

  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3, x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: lofi@FreeBSD.org

  If KDE does not start anymore after upgrading Xorg to version 6.8.1
  (X restarts when the KDE splash screen has reached the third icon),
  please check whether the directory /tmp/.ICE-unix exists, is owned by root
  and has permissions 1777 (read/write/access for everybody + sticky bit).

  To make sure everything is in working order, do (as root):
  mkdir -p /tmp/.ICE-unix && chmod 1777 /tmp/.ICE-unix &&
  chown root:wheel /tmp/.ICE-unix

  Also, make sure you do NOT have clear_tmp_enable="YES" set in /etc/rc.conf,
  as it will remove the directory on every reboot and applications will re-
  create it with the wrong ownership.

  Users of daily_clean_tmps_enable in /etc/periodic.conf should make sure
  daily_clean_tmps_ignore contains /tmp/.ICE-unix.

  AFFECTS: users of Horde and the related ports (Turba, IMP, Nag, Kronolith,
           Mnemo, Chora)
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  As of this update, the configuration files are generated by the application,
  with no support for configuration files used in previous versions.

  All data saved in the database, LDAP or MCAL backends will be preserved,
  considering that you run specific scripts to migrate to this new scheme.
  Affected ports are www/horde, mail/turba, deskutils/nag, deskutils/kronolith,
  and deskutils/mnemo. See the UPGRADING documentation of the ports in question
  for more details.

  The filter system of IMP 3.x has been replaced by a separate application:
  check the port mail/ingo. Ingo provides a script to migrate the existing
  filter rules from IMP 3.x, see Ingo's documentation.

  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/XFree86-4-Server and graphics/dri
  AUTHOR: lesi@FreeBSD.org

  As of version 4.4.0_6, XFree86-4-Server now depends on
  graphics/xfree86-dri. This is due to incompatibilities between
  XFree86 and the new xorg 6.8.1 DRI.

  Users of XFree86-4-Server are strongly encouraged to switch to
  the xfree86-dri port as follows:

	portupgrade -fo graphics/xfree86-dri graphics/dri

  which will also fix dependencies.

20041224:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade and lang/ruby18
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  Please upgrade sysutils/portupgrade prior to lang/ruby18, or

  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme03
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  security/gpgme03 has been modified to not conflicts with gpgme 1.x
  After upgrade, you need to rebuild all ports that depend on it.
  You should upgrade security/gpgme (if installed) to avoid nasty
  compile time failures, due to original location of gpgme.h.

20041219:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/jdictionary
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The location for JDictionary port installed files has changed. This also

20041213:
  AFFECTS: users of security/cryptplug, deskutils/kdepim3
  AUTHOR: lofi@FreeBSD.org

  The cryptplug port is not compatible with recent versions of gpgme
  and has been changed to depend on gpgme03 (the last version of gpg-
  me compatible with cryptplug).
  Users who have been using cryptplug in order to enable PGP/MIME support
  in KMail should DEINSTALL BOTH cryptplug and gpgme03 before updating
  KDE to version 3.3.2. Cryptplug is NOT necessary anymore to enable
  PGP/MIME support in KMail and will cause the kdepim3 build to fail due
  to conflicting dependencies.

20041213:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql-relay

  The port was split into a -server and -client component.
  The -server part contains the storage and director daemon, the -client

  AUTHOR: question+fbsdports@closedsrc.org

  There is a known quirk when using mail/getmail with Python 2.4
  where the DeprecationWarning is printed regarding the use of
  the 'strict' keyword when a message is being retrieved.

  You can redirect stdout/stderr to /dev/null to quelch the warning.

  The quirk may be fixed in a future version of getmail.

20041205:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/ffmpeg
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/ffmpeg will not work if previous versions of the port
  are installed. Also, there is a shared library version bump on
  this update. Therefore:

  1) Remove old ffmpeg

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/ffmpeg*

  2) Install updated ffmpeg

  3) Rebuild all ports that depend on ffmpeg due to the shared
  library version bump

  cd /var/db/pkg && portupgrade -rf ffmpeg* -x ffmpeg*

20041202:
  AFFECTS: users of any ports which have dependency on lang/python

20041118:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: lofi@FreeBSD.org

  portsdb(1) is part of the portupgrade suite and is used to convert a ports
  INDEX file to a binary INDEX.db database. By default, it uses the
  libc-builtin berkeley db to do so, which has a buggy btree implementation.

  If you see errors like "[BUG] Segmentation fault" while a portsdb update is
  in progress, adjust the PORTS_DBDRIVER variable (in your environment or in
  pkgtools.conf) to either bdb1_hash or dbm_hash.

  This problem was fixed in 5.3-RELEASE, but users of 4.10-RELEASE and
  5.2.1-RELEASE (and older releases) will find fixes by updating to the
  latest (at least after Sep 20) of RELENG_4 or RELENG_5.

  Bricolage may now be run on mod_perl compiled as a DSO for Apache
  when following these guidelines:

  http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/install.html#When_DSO_can_be_Used

  To do this, you will need to:
    pkg_delete -f apache-mod_perl
    pkg_delete -f p5-libapreq-static
    portupgrade -rR bricolage

  Bricolage will rebuild mod_perl, apache and libapreq using their standard
  versions.

20041115:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: lofi@FreeBSD.org

  Due to the recent removal of INDEX and INDEX-5 from FreeBSD's CVS,
  portupgrade with default configuration will run 'make index' if started
  after cvsup'ing the ports-collection. This may take an undesirably long
  time.

  There are several ways to work around this, for example:

  - Run 'make fetchindex' after cvsup'ing ports.

  or

  - Adjust the PORTS_INDEX variable in your environment or in
    pkgtools.conf (see portupgrade(1) or the default pkgtools.conf) to
    a different value than the default.

  Also remember that 'make index' is only supported on _complete_
  ports-trees. If you are currently refusing whole categories by means
  of a cvsup refuse file, use 'make fetchindex' instead (or consider
  keeping an extra machine/jail with a complete ports-tree around to
  do INDEX builds on).

  mpeg4ip has been updated and broken down into 2 separate ports:
  mpeg4ip and mpeg4ip-libmp4v2. Furthermore, mpeg4ip now depends
  on faad. Moreover, faad now depends on mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 rather
  than on mpeg4ip which avoids a cyclic dependency (mpeg4ip depends
  on faad which depends on mpeg4ip).

  If any of the old ports are installed, mpeg4ip will not compile.
  Therefore,

  1) Remove old faad and mpeg4ip ports which conflict with new
  mpeg4ip

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/mpeg4ip*
  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/faad*

  2) Install faad, mpeg4ip and mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 in the following
  order

  cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 && make install clean
  cd /usr/ports/audio/faad && make install clean
  cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mpeg4ip && make install clean

  AFFECTS: users of Java
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  javavmwrapper has been rewritten. It now creates symbolic links for
  all executables of the Java VMs that have been registered with it.
  These symbolic links may impact which version of Java you are using,
  depending on your PATH, which may need to be adjusted.

  For example, if your path is:

	${LOCALBASE}/bin:${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin

  then previously "java" would resolve to ${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin/java.
  With the new javavmwrapper it will resolve to ${LOCALBASE}/bin/java.
  Depending upon the Java VMs that are registered and various environment
  variables, it may or may not be ${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin/java that is
  run by javavmwrapper via the symbolic link ${LOCALBASE}/bin/java.

  To use GMail in konqueror, you need to set the browser identification for
  gmail.google.com to 'Safari 1.2.3 on Mac OS X', otherwise you will not be
  able to click on any links in GMail after logging in.

  You can set site-specific browser identifications via the Settings menu in
  Konqueror (Configure Konqueror/Browser Identification) or in the KDE Control
  Center, Internet & Network/Web Browser/Browser Identification.

  Hey, 2.6! You don't have to be 2.6 anymore!
  Do NOT use portupgrade(1) to update your GNOME 2.6 desktop to 2.8:
  it won't work, and you'll have to recompile bunches of ports by hand
  as a result. Use the gnome_upgrade.sh script to automate the upgrade
  process. The script is available from

  AUTHOR: marshall@chezmarshall.com

  Upgrading from 2003.2 to 2004.2 is straightforward, it is highly
  recommended to checkpoint and backup your server as follows:
    p4 verify //...
    p4 verify -u //... # possibly redundant
    p4 admin checkpoint
    p4 admin stop
    <backup repository>

  If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 2003.2, you should
  consult the Perforce documentation
    (http://www.perforce.com/perforce/technical.html)
  before proceeding.

  Also, it looks as though Perforce has stopped updating the man pages,
  so they are no longer included in the port.

  AUTHOR: freebsd-gnome@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrading to firefox-1.0.1.p, certain things such as extension/theme
  [de]installation, and "Find On Page" may no longer work. You may also
  notice an infinite loop when starting Firefox. If this happens, backup
  ~/.mozilla/firefox/*/bookmarks.html, and remove ~/.mozilla/firefox.
  Afterward, Firefox should start up. You can then restore the bookmarks.html
  file to the new ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default directory.

  AFFECTS: users of ports that require several base system libraries who
	   are running FreeBSD 5.3-BETA7 or later (including -current)
  AUTHOR: kensmith@FreeBSD.org

  As part of the FreeBSD-5.3 release the following system libraries
  had their version number incremented:

	/lib/libm.so.2 -> libm.so.3
	/lib/libreadline.so.4 -> libreadline.so.5
	/usr/lib/libhistory.so.4 -> libhistory.so.5
	/usr/lib/libopie.so.2 -> libopie.so.3
	/usr/lib/libpcap.so.2 -> libpcap.so.3

  This should have no effect unless you are using FreeBSD 5.3-BETA7 or
  higher, or if you are a -current user who upgraded after this date.
  Assuming you did a from-source upgrade new versions of these libraries
  will be created but the old versions will be left behind (for example
  /lib/libm.so.2 will be the old one, /lib/libm.so.3 will be the new one).
  Any ports or pre-built packages you have currently installed will
  continue to use the old library, any ports you install after the upgrade
  will begin to use the new library. You will need to have all your
  ports recompiled before the old library goes away. To help with the
  migration you could also use /etc/libmap.conf to map libm.so.2 to
  libm.so.3.

  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: tmseck@netcologne.de

  www/squid now installs an rcNG script by default. This means you
  need to explicitly enable squid by setting squid_enable=yes in
  /etc/rc.conf.
  The squid.sh script uses the following variables:
  squid_chdir
  squid_flags
  squid_user

  Please see the squid.sh script for further details.
  If you want to install an old style rc-script, build the port with
  "WITHOUT_SQUID_RCNG=YES" or by rerunning "make config" and disabling this
  option.

20040830:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kde3, x11/kdelibs3, x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  In KDE 3.3, a number of files were moved between ports and some ports
  were removed. This means that you will have to take some precautions
  to update your KDE installation. A simple portupgrade -a will not work.
  portupgrade -R kde can fail as well, depending on what parts of KDE you
  have currently installed. We therefore recommend sticking to the following
  procedure. The procedure requires you to have sysutils/portupgrade installed
  and you to be the superuser (or using sudo). We recommend not being logged in
  to a KDE session on the machine you're performing the upgrade on. If you
  choose to perform the update while being logged in to KDE, expect erratic
  behavior and crashes from applications launched during the update.

  1.) First, make sure your ports index is up to date.

      	cd /usr/ports && make index

      or, if you're using the sysutils/portindex port

      	portindex

  2.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

      	pkg_deinstall -f kdeaddons-kontact-plugins-\* \
      	kdeaddons-kaddressbook-plugins-\* kdepim-\* kdeutils-\* \
      	kdeaddons-\[0-9\]\* kde-\[0-9\]\*

      kdegraphics now conflicts with the kolourpaint package and kdeedu now
      conflicts with the kwordquiz package. If you have kwordquiz and/or
      kolourpaint installed on your system and you want to use the kdegraphics/
      kdeedu ports, you should first deinstall the conflicting packages:

      	pkg_deinstall -f kolourpaint\* kwordquiz\*


  3.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

      	portupgrade arts\* kde\* quanta\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

      	portupgrade -a

      Note that the quanta port has been renamed to kdewebdev. The commands
      above will automatically replace quanta with kdewebdev, if you have
      quanta installed.

  4.) Reinstall any KDE ports you deleted in step 2. Note that the kdeaddons-
      kontact-plugins (net/kontact-plugins), kdepim-kpilot (palm/kpilot) and
      quanta (www/quanta) ports/packages do not exist anymore and cannot be
      reinstalled.

  Known post-updating issues:

  - If you're missing acoustic notifications (system sounds) after the update:

    	rm ~/.kde/share/config/knotifyrc

    Then log out of KDE and back in again.

  - KMail has been heavily modified since KDE 3.2.x. Testing shows that KMail
    can display erratic behavior and crashes after the update. If you see any
    such behavior, it is recommended to simply close KMail and start it again
    until it resumes normal operation.

    The integration of GnuPG and KMail for signing, encrypting and verifying
    PGP/MIME mail has also changed. A quick howto is available at
    http://freebsd.kde.org/howtos/gnupg-kmail.php.

  - kdm users might get warnings from kdm about obsolete lines in kdmrc.
    You can migrate your configuration while preserving your customizations
    by running

    	genkdmconf

    Make sure to backup your old kdmrc (usually found in
    /usr/local/share/config/kdm) beforehand in case the merge produces an
    invalid configuration.

  japanese/ptex-tetex, japanese/xdvik, and japanese/dvipsk now
  look for the texmf.cnf file in $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf first,
  while some utilities included in the original teTeX distribution
  such as kpsepath(1) look for the file in $TEXMF/web2c/texmf.cnf
  first. This is for separating the pTeX's texmf.cnf and
  the original TeX's texmf.cnf, and you do not have to copy or
  link the file $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf to $TEXMF/web2c/.
  To lookup pTeX path by using kpsepath(1) and so on, please
  set TEXMFCNF environment variable as described in
  $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf. For more detail, see
  $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf and $TEXMF/web2c/texmf.cnf.

  AFFECTS: users of japanese/platex209-*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  japanese/platex209-* are renamed to japanese/platex209 and
  now depend on japanese/ptex-tetex. While EUC-JP and JIS
  encoding can be used by default, but Shift JIS is no longer
  supported because it makes very difficult to maintain other
  pTeX related ports. However, "ptex --kanji=sjis" still works,
  so it can be used if all of macro files under share/texmf are
  converted to Shift JIS encoding manually.

20040820:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/dvipsk-vflib
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  japanese/dvipsk-vflib has been removed because it is not maintained

  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org, mat@FreeBSD.org, marcus@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 has been updated to 5.8.5. you should update everything
  depending on perl, that is:
    * first, upgrade your perl5.8 installation.
    * run "use.perl port", so that the system knows you have 5.8.5.
    * now, run some magic incantations to upgrade all ports depending on perl,
      that is run something like :
      portupgrade -f `(pkg_info -R perl-5.8.5 |tail +4; \
        find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.[124] -type f -print0 \
        | xargs -0 pkg_which -fv | sed -e '/: ?/d' -e 's/.*: //')|sort -u`
      This is likely to fail for a few ports, you'll have to upgrade them
      afterwards.
      Please note, that this last step is, strictly speaking, not necessary,
      if you are upgrading from 5.8.4. But it is cleaner to do so anyway.

  . The import task used the canonical version of a file path. This
    has been changed to use the absolute path. Bugzilla 28505.
  . ant-xalan2.jar has been removed since the only class contained
    in it didn't depend on Xalan-J 2 at all. Its sole dependency has
    always been TraX and so it has been merged into ant-trax.jar.
  . All exceptions thrown by tasks are now wrapped in a buildexception
    giving the location in the buildfile of the task.
  . Nested elements for namespaced tasks and types may belong to
    the Ant default namespace as well as the task's or type's namespace.

  After migrating from XFree86 to X.Org, you must rebuild
  x11-toolkits/libwnck and x11/libxklavier for full GNOME functionality
  to be restored.

  AUTHOR: anholt@FreeBSD.org

  The XFREE86_VERSION variable is deprecated and has been replaced by the
  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM variable. X_WINDOW_SYSTEM may be set to xorg, xfree86-4, or
  xfree86-3. X_WINDOW_SYSTEM defaults to xorg on FreeBSD-current. If you are
  switching to xorg, you should follow this set of commands to cleanly upgrade:

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/imake-4* /var/db/pkg/XFree86-*
  cd /usr/ports/x11/xorg && make install
  pkgdb -F

  Users of -stable or older -current can switch to X.Org by setting
  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM=xorg in make.conf and following the same process.

  Alternately, FreeBSD 5.x and later users can use portupgrade with packages:
    cd /var/db/pkg
    portupgrade -o devel/imake-6 imake-4*
    portupgrade -o x11/xorg-libraries XFree86-libraries

  AFFECTS: users of PHP
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The old lang/php4 and lang/php5 ports have been split into 'base' PHP,
  PEAR, and shared extensions to allow more flexibility and add new features.
  Upgrading your current PHP installation will result in a 'base' PHP
  installation (no PEAR and no extensions).
  PEAR can be found in the new devel/php4-pear and devel/php5-pear ports, while
  the set of PHP extensions to install can be chosen via the meta-ports
  lang/php4-extensions and lang/php5-extensions, or installing singular
  extensions individually.
  If you have a previous php.ini configuration file, be sure to comment out
  the extension_dir parameter, since the correct path is statically compiled
  into the PHP binary.
  For an overview of the modules used with the old PHP binary, use
  the command "php -m".

  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap21{,-sasl}-client
  AUTHOR: eik@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP version 2.2 is now the default. To upgrade all ports do
    portupgrade -rfo net/openldap22-client openldap-client
  (or a similar command for the SASL variant). If you do not want to
  upgrade, add the line `WANT_OPENLDAP_VER?=21' to /etc/make.conf

  Note that when you want to upgrade openldap21{,sasl}-server, you have
  to use slapcat/slapadd to migrate the database, since the internal
  format is not binary compatible. Simply upgrading the server without
  doing a slapcat first can corrupt your database.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim on FreeBSD 5.x
  AUTHOR: eik@FreeBSD.org

  The default location of the startup script has been changed to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d. When you depend on the previous behavior,
  build the port with WITH_RCORDER=yes.

  Setting WITH_OPENLDAP_VER and WITH_MYSQL_VER do not automatically
  imply the corresponding WITH_ variable. The use of these options
  is discouraged, use the global settings (WANT_OPENLDAP_VER and
  DEFAULT_MYSQL_VER) to set system wide defaults.

20040709:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/milter-sender
  AUTHOR: vs@FreeBSD.org

  Milter-sender version 0.58 released.
  When updating to version 0.58, beware if you have a personalized
  configuration file (milter-sender.cf). The meaning of the
  MxAcceptsAllAction variable has changed and its default has changed
  from 4 to 6. If this variable is not updated, greylisting might be
  more aggressive than expected.

20040708:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  Opera 7.52 released.
  The file search.ini has been changed to ensure correct default
  addresses for dictionary and encyclopedia searches. Existing
  versions will be overwritten on upgrade. Users who have a
  customized search.ini file that they would like to keep, should
  edit its version number to 4 before upgrading. Note that you
  have to edit the search.ini file located in the /.opera folder.

  [Version]
  File Version=4

  Other changes you are may find in changelog, its

  separate slave ports. Please install textproc/py-libxml2 and
  textproc/py-libxslt to get bindings back to your system.

20040703:
  AFFECTS: users of net/netatalk-devel
  AUTHOR: marcus@FreeBSD.org

  Netatalk-devel has been converted to use RCng. That means all of the
  netatalk daemons must be enabled in /etc/rc.conf before they will start
  (previously, all netatalk daemons would start by default). The following
  variables are used by the new netatalk.sh script:

  atalkd_enable
  cnid_metad_enable
  papd_enable
  afpd_enable
  timelord_enable

  See the netatalk.sh script for more details.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/php4 and lang/php5 with the PDFlib extension
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The PDFlib extension has been removed from the archive and moved to PECL.
  Consequently to enable it you have to install print/pecl-pdflib.
  Alternatively you may want to try the experimental print/pecl-panda.

20040625:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/pure-ftpd
  AUTHOR: pav@FreeBSD.org

  Pure-ftpd must be enabled in rc.conf now. Add this to your /etc/rc.conf:

  rc.conf. See the script for details.

20040619:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/webmin and sysutils/usermin
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  The webmin and usermin ports must now be enabled in rc.conf.
  See the pkg-message or script for details.

20040618:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/ptex-tetex
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The texmf.cnf file for pTeX is now installed in texmf/web2c-ptex.

20040618:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/ptex-pkfonts*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/ptex-pkfonts* has been removed because pkfonts are
  already included in the teTeX distribution.

20040618:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/xdvik-vflib*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/xdvik-vflib no longer supports VFlib2, and now depends on
  print/freetype2. For the configuration details, see vfontmap file which
  installed as texmf/xdvi/vfontmap. japanese/kochi-ttfonts is used for
  min and goth by default.

  xdvik-vflib-pk* variants has been removed because pkfonts are already included
  in the teTeX distribution.

20040618:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The print/teTeX has been split into print/teTeX-base and print/teTeX-texmf,
  and print/teTeX is now a meta-port for the two and print/dvipsk-tetex and
  print/xdvik. print/teTeX installs dvips and xdvi by default again (via
  print/dvipsk-tetex and print/xdvik). For people who want to use teTeX,
  simply install print/teTeX with options set by default.

  print/teTeX-base has additional options for adding xdvi and dvips included
  in the teTeX distribution itself, but use of them are not recommended if
  you do not understand what you are trying to do. Especially, when the
  options are set by yourself, do not install ports that match *xdvi* and
  *dvips* because they break the installed print/teTeX-base's dviware
  and such conflicts will not be detected. In most cases, a combination
  of print/teTeX-base + print/dvipsk-tetex + print/xdvik (which are
  installed by print/teTeX by default) will be sufficient.

20040615:
  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The firefox-0.9 update has a special requirement before you can run it.
  You must first run firefox as root before running it as another user.
  The best way to do this is to su - to root or log
  in as root (i.e. do not su -m to root). After becoming root, simply run
  ``firefox''. You can then quit the browser, then run it as any other
  user. If you do not run firefox as root first, the browser window will
  not appear.

20040608:
  AFFECTS: users of net/haproxy
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/mkisofs and sysutils/mkisofs-devel
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org, marius@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/mkisofs and sysutils/mkisofs-devel were merged into
  sysutils/cdrtools and sysutils/cdrtools-devel respectively.

  To update them generate ("make index") or fetch ("make fetchindex") a
  new INDEX/INDEX-5. Run "pkgdb -F" and unregister the mkisofs/-devel
  port. Then forcefully update the cdrtools port and all of its
  dependencies (e.g. "portupgrade -rf cdrtools"). After the update
  it may be necessary to rerun "pkgdb -F" and resolve a stale
  dependency to cdrtools.

20040531:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org, marcus@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 has been updated to 5.8.4. you should update everything
  depending on perl, that is :
    * first, upgrade your perl5.8 installation.
    * run "use.perl port", so that the system knows you have 5.8.4.
    * now, run some magic incantations to upgrade all ports depending on perl,
      that is run something like :
      portupgrade -f `(pkg_info -R perl-5.8.4 |tail +4; \
        find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.2 -type f -print0 \
        | xargs -0 pkg_which -fv | sed -e '/: ?/d' -e 's/.*: //')|sort -u`
      This is likely to fail for a few ports, you'll have to upgrade them
      afterward.

20040529:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailman and japanese/mailman
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  In Mailman 2.1.5, some significant changes have been made to the

  installed version of faad and reinstall from port.

20040512:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The print/teTeX no longer installs dvipsk by default. To build and
  install dvipsk, you have to specify WITH_DVIPSK, or the dvipsk utility
  in the print/teTeX is also available print/dvipsk-tetex separately.
  This change is to resolve conflicts between various versions of dvips.

20040504:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/drac
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  The "drac_flags" rc.conf(5) variable has been renamed to "dracd_flags".

  The cdrecord program now uses ${PREFIX}/etc (e.g. /usr/local/etc) instead
  of /etc/default as the location of the global configuration file. If you
  created such a configuration file you need to copy it over to the new
  location.

20040420:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you update KDE from version 3.2.1 or earlier to version 3.2.2 while
  running a KDE session, newly opened instances of Konqueror might hang
  or crash, depending on how far the update has progressed.

  If this happens, it is necessary to restart your KDE session in order to
  restore proper operations.

20040404:
  AFFECTS: GNOME desktop users
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.6. Simply portupgrading will cause serious
  problems if you are using the desktop itself. If you are a GNOME desktop
  user, you should carefully read the instructions at:

  http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq26.html

  And use the gnome_upgrade.sh script to properly upgrade to GNOME 2.6. If
  you are just a casual user of some of the GNOME libraries, portupgrade
  should be sufficient to update your ports.

20040316:
  AFFECTS: users of net/isc-dhcp3-*
  AUTHOR: des@FreeBSD.org

  The isc-dhcp3-* ports must now be enabled / disabled and configured in

  DO NOT UPGRADE WITHOUT READING THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

20040309:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs3 and x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you update kdelibs from version 3.2.0 to version 3.2.1 while running
  a KDE 3.2.0 session, newly opened instances of Konqueror will silently
  crash as soon as the new version of kdelibs has been installed, due to
  mismatching linker symbols.

  It is recommended you quit your KDE session at that point and update
  kdebase to version 3.2.1, then restart KDE.

20040309:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/arts and x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The arts port, PORTVERSION 1.2.1 does not include artswrapper anymore.
  Instead, artswrapper is now installed by a new port audio/artswrapper.

  Installation of artswrapper is optional, however:

  If you presently run KDE and you have "Run with the highest possible
  priority (realtime priority)" checked in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
  Sound System and you choose to NOT install audio/artswrapper, you need to

  - Uncheck "Run with the highest possible priority (realtime priority)"
    in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/Sound System BEFORE updating arts

  OR

  - AFTER updating arts and kdebase, go to Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
    Sound System, click on the unchecked "Run with the highest possible priority
    (realtime priority)", dismiss the message telling you that realtime is un-
    available or artswrapper is missing and then click Apply.

20040305:
  AFFECTS: users of security/antivir-milter
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  When updating from a previous version of security/antivir-milter you
  have to do the following after deinstalling the old port:
      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir
      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir.vdf
      chown root:wheel <PREFIX>/AntiVir
      chown root:smmsp <PREFIX>/AntiVir/hbedv.key
    In your SENDMAIL_MC change
      `S=unix:<PREFIX>/AntiVir/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:5m'
    to:
      `S=unix:/var/spool/avmilter/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:10m'
    and rebuild sendmail.cf.
    If /var/spool/avmilter exist you have to:
      chown -R smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/avmilter
    If you are using a customized <PREFIX>/etc/avmilter.conf the port
    won't remove it on deinstall and you have to manually change User
    and Group to smmsp there.
    Afterwards you can install the new version of this port. You then
    should run antivirupdater to get a current VDF.

20040226:
  AFFECTS: i386 users of lang/ruby* and sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  Change the default version of ruby to 1.8 for i386.

  If you are a ruby developer and want to keep ruby 1.6 as default,
  please add RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.6 to /etc/make.conf.

  Otherwise, please run the following series of commands to migrate to
  ruby 1.8:

  1) Reinstall portupgrade manually (and as a result ruby 1.8 will be
     installed):
	pkg_delete portupgrade-\*
	(cd /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade; make install clean)

  2) Reinstall everything that depends on ruby 1.6 to use ruby 1.8
     instead:
	portupgrade -fr lang/ruby16

  3) Reinstall ruby 1.8 (because the previous step kills symlinks):
	portupgrade -f lang/ruby18

  4) Deinstall ruby 1.6 stuff (if you are paranoia):
	pkg_deinstall -ri lang/ruby16

  5) If the above commands do now work somehow and portupgrade starts
     causing LoadError, please reinstall portupgrade manually again.
     Whenever you get confused, you can always deinstall portupgrade
     and all the ruby stuff (run "pkg_delete -r ruby-\*") and
     reinstall portupgrade as a last resort.

20040204:
  AFFECTS: 5.2-CURRENT users who started with a 5.2-RELEASE or older.
  AUTHOR: obrien@FreeBSD.org

        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.8 -f perl-5.6.1_15

  2) Update all p5-* modules.
	portupgrade -f p5-\*
