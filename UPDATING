This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

20231125:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php81
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 8.1 to 8.2.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info \*php81\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php81 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php82.

20231104:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.8 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20231031:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion-lts
  AUTHOR: michaelo@FreeBSD.org

  devel/subversion-lts has been updated from 1.10.x to the latest LTS version,
  1.14.x. Some changes between these releases may require attention from
  administrators or users.
  Refer to https://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.14.html#compat-misc for details.

20231028:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nfdump

  nfdump-1.7.x is compatible to nfdump-1.6.18, which means it can
  read files created with nfdump-1.6.18 or newer. Flow files created
  with earlier nfdump versions may not contain all flow elements.
  If you have older files, it is recommended to use nfdump-1.6.17
  to update the records.

  nfdump 1.7.x provides the same set of programs as 1.6.x and can
  be used almost as a drop-in replacement. This may change in future
  and older legacy programs may be removed. You can convert any old
  files from nfdump-1.6 to nfdump-1.7 format by reading/writing
  files: ./nfdump -r old-flowfile -y -w new-flowfile

  Please note, that only nfdump may read older flow files. All other
  programs relay on the new file format.

20231027:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  When updating to >= 23.10.0, a broken crontab is fixed. This breakage
  caused the validation error: Scheduler is not running
  After updating, If that error does not clear for you, run:

    sudo lnms config:cache

20231027:
  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript9*
  AUTHOR: michaelo@FreeBSD.org

  The default ghostscript version has been updated from 9 to 10.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 9 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ghostscript 9 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ghostscript=9

  Please note that print/ghostcript9* will be removed in the future since it is
  not supported by upstream anymore.

20231026:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/chicken
  AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  The chicken binaries csc and csi, together with their manual pages, have been
  renamed to chicken-csc and chicken-csi, to avoid conflicts with lang/mono.
  This is in line with what several Linux distros do. See PR 274736.

20231023:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailman3
  AUTHOR: einar@isnic.is

  logging.http section has now been split into two parts, logging.http is for
  the Mailman internal code and logging.gunicorn is for Gunicorn specifically
  since they have different logging formats. This should fix spurious errors
  with KeyError: t that was often confusing for users.

  Python 3.9 is now the minimum supported version of Python.

20231017:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.36.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20181213, it should still be the same.

20231014:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl and security/openssl30
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The openssl port was renamed to openssl111 and subsequently the
  openssl30 port was renamed to openssl.

  The shared library version of OpenSSL has been bumped.

  Users of DEFAULT_VERSIONS= ssl=openssl30 must update this to
  ssl=openssl.
  Users of DEFAULT_VERSIONS= ssl=openssl should not change this unless
  they use ports that require the deprecated OpenSSL 1.1.1 version.

  You must rebuild all ports that depend on OpenSSL if you use OpenSSL
  from ports.

20231011:
  AFFECTS: users of www/caddy
  AUTHOR:  adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The default admin endpoint has changed from localhost:2019 to
  /var/run/caddy/caddy.sock. Using a Unix socket is more secure,
  allowing it to be secured by filesystem permissions rather than
  requiring a firewall.

  If you only control caddy from the rc(8) script (service caddy ...),
  you don't need to do anything. If you access the API yourself, you
  will want to update your scripts to use the new socket.

  To use the old endpoint, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

    caddy_admin="localhost:2019"

20231009:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ntpd-rs
  AUTHOR: mikael@freebsd.org

  In 1.0.0 the configuration has been completely reworked, please check the
  documentation for details. Configuration will not automatically migrate.

20231004:
  AFFECTS: www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR:  mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Before you upgrade to version 16.4.x or higher, make sure you did the
  upgrade to 16.3.x!

  The database migration for 16.4.1 can fail due to unexpected name of a foreign key.
  So it is recommended to have a database backup available in case the solution
  described in the update manual does not work for you.

  The upgrade manual can be found as usual here:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/-/blob/master/update/16.3-16.4-freebsd.md


20230930:
  AFFECTS: users of Transmission (net-p2p/transmission@*)
  AUTHOR:  mondo.debater_0q@icloud.com

  Fixes Bug 274065 by reorganizing the port as a metaport
  (net-p2p/transmission) and components port (net-p2p/transmission-components).
  Each component may be installed through the flavors of
  transmission-componenents (@cli, @daemon, @docs, @gtk, @qt, @utils).
  Alternatively, one or more component may be installed by running make config
  on the metaport net-p2p/transmission.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/php-composer2
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  The composer2 ports has been moved over the old devel/php-composer
  port, which was still providing the old EOLed version 1 of the
  software.

  Please use `pkg install php81-composer` (substitute 81 with the
  PHP version you're using) to properly upgrade.

20230924:
  AFFECTS: users of XFCE desktop (x11-wm/xfce4)
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  XFCE 4.18 is incompatible with the latest version of the adwaita
  icon theme (version 42.0 and newer), which was used as the default one.
  Due to this the default icon theme has been changed to
  x11-themes/xfce-icons-elementary.

  Users that have XFCE already installed and are using the adwaita
  icon theme will notice missing icons. To fix this you can install
  any other icon theme (like x11-themes/xfce-icons-elementary) and
  configure XFCE to use that via the "appearance" settings application,
  under the "icons" tab.

20230919:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission
  AUTHOR:  mondo.debater_0q@icloud.com

  The 4.0 port haphazardly consolidated prior slave ports into flavors of a single port.
  The flavors have now been revised to better match releases prior to 4.0.
  The -full flavor included in the 4.0 port has been replaced with -default, which
  restores the compile-time options of prior release's metaport. Other flavors allow
  for more piecemeal installs. The prior -web slave port can be installed through the
  -default flavor or the -daemon flavor.

  See Bug 273841 for more details.

20230915:
  AFFECTS: users of print/ghostscript10
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  The port flavors have been replaced with a default port option of X11.
  The flavors approach creates conflicting dependencies with other ports which
  cannot be solved this time with the ports framework.

  See PRs 270989 and 272541 for details.

20230910:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/powerdns
  AUTHOR: tremere@cainites.net

  In Authoritative Server 4.8, the LMDB backend gains a new Lightning
  Stream-compatible schema, which requires a data migration (this is
  automatic, and there is no migration back to the old schema). LMDB
  backend users should pay extra attention to the Upgrade Notes
  (https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/upgrading.html).

20230910:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Please make sure that the PostgreSQL server for the NetBox instance is
     running version 12 or higher.  This is because Django 4.2 requires
     PostgreSQL 12 as a minimum.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20230908:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 13 to 15.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 13, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql13-server postgresql13-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql13-server-13.12.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql13-contrib-13.12.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib databases/postgresql13-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql15-server databases/postgresql15-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql15-server databases/postgresql15-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql15-server databases/postgresql15-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data15 -U postgres"
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /var/db/postgres/data13/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data15/ -U postgres "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres" in 11. The migration steps above now assume
     the "postgres" database user and FreeBSD user.
  2) See the updating entry 20190829 if you are updating from a release prior to 11.
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20230906:
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/devcpu-data*

  The CPU microcode ports have been reorganized.  The new ports are:
  sysutils/cpu-microcode, sysutils/cpu-microcode-amd,
  sysutils/cpu-microcode-intel, and cpu-microcode-rc.

  To install all CPU microcode packages:

     pkg install cpu-microcode

  To install only packages for a specific CPU vendor:

     pkg install cpu-microcode-amd

     or

     pkg install cpu-microcode-intel

  To give users time to adjust to these changes, sysutils/devcpu-data will
  remain in the tree until the end of 2023.  The port has been converted to a
  metaport and now provides the same functionality as sysutils/cpu-microcode.

  Refer to the commit log in bc7829212d153aeff69b439d08e2e3001ef88ba3 for an
  explanation as to why these changes were made.

20230904:
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab

  The rc.d script of 4.0.2 had an error which didn't take the user to
  run openhab into account. After installing the update and stopping
  openhab run (for the default settings)
    chown -R openhab:openhab /var/db/openhab/userdata /var/log/openhab
  If you use other directories for the userdata and logs, you need to
  adapt accordingly.

20230822:
  AUTHOR: arrowd@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/polkit together with sysutils/consolekit2

  ConsoleKit2 has grown some logind1 compatibility which resulted in breaking
  changes in its API. One of its consumers, Polkit, is patched to handle it,
  so make sure to update both ports simultaneously.

20230822:
  AUTHOR: leres@FreeBSD.org
  AFFECTS: users of security/zeek

  Zeek has been upgraded to 6.0.0 and the NETMAP option was removed;
  it was too difficult to build it without zeek being installed in
  %%PREFIX%%.

  The consensus was that this was a rarely used feature, please
  reach out to me if need this (I've done some work on a new
  security/zeek-netmap port that is probably the right way forward).

  When I upgraded zeek on my systems I found some cruft left over
  from previous versions. The way I recommend upgrading from 5.0.9 to
  6.0.0 is:

      service zeek stop
      pkg delete -fy zeek py311-zkg
      [clean up leftover files in /usr/local/lib/zeek]
      pkg install -y zeek
      service zeek deploy

20230817:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to 7.2. Users wanting to
  stay on 7.0 can replace databases/redis with databases/redis70 with
  one of the following commands.

  If you use pkg with binary packages:
    # pkg set -o databases/redis:databases/redis70
    # pkg upgrade
  If you use portmaster:
    # portmaster -o databases/redis70 databases/redis
  If you use portupgrade:
    # portupgrade -o databases/redis70 databases/redis

20230814:
  AFFECTS: usrs of www/kdsoap
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/kdsoap has been flavorized to support both Qt5 and Qt6.
  For symmetry, the Qt5 package has been renamed to kdsoap-qt5.

20230811:
  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-AnyEvent-WebSocket-Client
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  The update to AnyEvent-WebSocket-Client 0.55 introduce a change in behavior:
  close() default return code is now 1000 instead of 1005

20230730:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.34.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20181213, it should still be the same.

20230726:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The update to openhab 4.0.0 may require changes to the running 3.x setup.
  Read the release notes at
    https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/4.0.0
  and the blog entry at
    https://www.openhab.org/blog/2023-07-23-openhab-4-0-release.html
  for manual changes which are required before updating the port.

  After the update the pkg-message provides some more info about manual
  changes which are required to perform before the first start of 4.0.0.

  Note, this includes a switch from java 11 to java 17. You can deinstall
  openjdk11 afterwards, if it is not needed for something else.

20230723:
  AFFECTS: users of security/py-cryptography
  AUTHOR: tcberner@FreeBSD.org

  Modern py-cryptography uses rust. In order to still support the Tier-2
  architectures without rust support, a new default-version was added:
     PYCRYPTOGRAPHY
  it allows for the values 'rust' and 'legacy'.
  The default is 'rust' on all platforms supporting this.
  Note: users that are relying on the 'legacy' version will also take care
  of using a non-base OpenSSL in the future.

20230620:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/elixir-devel
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

	Note that Elixir now *requires* OTP25+ or better at runtime.
	For the -devel flavour you are still free to choose OTP25 or
	OTP26, but the default OTP24 from lang/erlang will *not* work.

20230618:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/soft-serve
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  soft-serve no longer uses config repository for configuration. To migrate
  configuration from 0.4.x to 0.5.x, please review the upgrade documentation at:

      https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/releases/tag/v0.5.0

  The migration process has been incorporated in rc.d script's migrate command,
  and can be performed using following instructions:

  0. Please make sure to backup repository data

  1. Stop existing process:

      # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/soft-serve stop

  2. Run the rc.d script to migrate, e.g.

      # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/soft-serve migrate
      INFO Setting SSH listen address...
      INFO Copying SSH host key...
      INFO Reading config repository...
      INFO Setting server settings...
      INFO Copying repos...
      INFO   Copying repo ports
      INFO   Copying readme from "config" to ".soft-serve"
      INFO Setting repos metadata & collabs...
      INFO Creating users & collabs...
      INFO Creating user "ashish"
      INFO Writing config...
      INFO Done!

  Another variable is introduced in rc.d script, soft_serve_data_path,
  indicating the path to data directory used by soft-serve.

20230618:
  AFFECTS: textproc/apache-solr*
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Apache solr is upgraded to version 9.
  Data migration is required, examples for dovecot data can be found here:
  https://dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2022-May/124701.html
  https://dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2022-May/124711.html

  If you like to stay on version8:
  # pkg delete apache-solr
  # pkg install apache-solr8

20230609:
  AFFECTS: users of security/sequoia
  AUTHOR: vishwin@FreeBSD.org

  sq has been split to security/sequoia-sq; security/sequoia becomes
  a meta-port, where security/sequoia-sq is currently the only
  dependency. As other programs are individually ported over, they
  will become OPTIONS in the meta-port.

  Per upstream, FFI is deprecated in favour of point solutions.

20230602:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. If the plugin security/py-netbox-secretstore is used, which is no
     longer maintained by upstream, the following steps must be done before
     upgrading to NetBox 3.5:

     * Migrate from security/py-netbox-secretstore (= 1.4.2_2) to
       security/py-netbox-secrets (= 1.7.6) with a NetBox 3.4.x instance.

       It is very important that the versions of py-netbox-secretstore and
       py-netbox-secrets match as specified otherwise the migration will not
       be successful.

       The reason for this is that py-netbox-secrets 1.8.x is not backwards
       compatible with Netbox 3.4.  For further details please see the
       updating instructions of py-netbox-secretstore or the UPDATING entry
       of 2023-05-11.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20230531:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netdisco
  AUTHOR: dgeo@centrale-marseille.fr

  The netdisco user now needs a HOME and a shell.
  For existing installs you will need to set
  HOME to /usr/local/etc/netdisco and shell to /bin/sh.

  For example in one shell line:
  pw user mod netdisco -d /usr/local/etc/netdisco -s /bin/sh

20230526:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  The port changes from USE_DB to USE_NDBM. Any existing configuration like
  ${lookup{$needle}dbm{haystack.db}}
  will need to change to
  ${lookup{$needle}dbm{haystack}}.

  Please also rename your old DBM files while the exim daemon is stopped:
  find /var/spool/exim/db/* -not -name \*.lockfile -exec mv -i {} {}.db \;

20230513:
  AFFECTS: users of www/tt-rss
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  www/tt-rss now expects the user to install the database drivers by hand
  allowing the port to be database independent however it would be best if you
  mark the php driver packages as a non-automatic package such that
  pkg-autoremove doesn't uninstall them.

  Change 80 to your corresponding php version (80, 81, 82)

  mysql: pkg set -yA 0 php80-mysqli php80-pdo_mysql;
  pgsql: pkg set -yA 0 php80-pgsql php80-pdo_pgsql;

20230511:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/py-netbox-secretstore
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream no longer maintains py-netbox-secretstore which it is not
  compatible with NetBox 3.5 or newer.  To ensure compatibility with newer
  releases of NetBox, the py-netbox-secrets plugin should be used instead.

  To migrate from security/py-netbox-secretstore to
  security/py-netbox-secrets please do following steps:

   1. Make a backup.

   2. Install security/py-netbox-secrets

   3. Enable both plugins by updating the following line in the netbox
      configuration (e.g. /usr/local/share/netbox/netbox/configuration.py):

      PLUGINS = ['netbox_secretstore', 'netbox_secrets']

   4. Run NetBox migrations:

      # cd /usr/local/share/netbox
      # python3.9 manage.py migrate

   5. Re-adjust the indices for the netbox-secrets plugin:

      # python3.9 manage.py sqlsequencereset netbox_secrets > output.sql

   6. Run the output of the previous command in the database, e.g.:

      # psql -d NETBOXDB < output.sql

   7. You can now remove netbox-secretstore from the application by removing
      it from the PLUGINS line in the netbox configuration:

      PLUGINS = ['netbox_secrets']

   8. Collect static files of the netbox-secrets plugin:

      # python3.9 manage.py collectstatic --no-input

   9. Restart WSGI/httpd environment (supervisord/apache/nginx/etc.).

  10. You may have clean up your database of the old tables manually, e.g.:

      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_secret;
      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_secretrole;
      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_sessionkey;
      DROP TABLE netbox_secretstore_userkey;

  11. Uninstall security/py-netbox-secretstore.

20230505:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  The patches included in the mail/mutt port will be removed in approximately a
  month making the port more inline with upstream. If you require any of these
  features most are available in mail/neomutt or it's possible to use
  EXTRA_PATCH_TREE to patch a port when building locally.

20230504:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/py-mqttwarn
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The redis option REISPUB has been renamed to REDISPUB

  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.6 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby30
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 3.0 to 3.1.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 3.0 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 3.0 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=3.0

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20230314:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openssl-devel
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  Users using DEFAULT_VERSIONS=ssl=openssl-devel must update their
  configuration to DEFAULT_VERSIONS=ssl=openssl30 or openssl31.

20230313:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/sqlite3
  AUTHOR: fuz@FreeBSD.org

  Due to various ports not being prepared for this change (see 20230227
  entry), the DQS option of databases/sqlite3 has been reenabled as a
  stop gap measure.  It is scheduled to be disabled again for good no
  earlier than 20240101, giving downstream software authors more time
  to fix their queries.

20230311:
  AFFECTS: users of net/dshell
  AUTHOR: nobutaka@FreeBSD.org

  net/dshell now depends on net/py-pcapy-ng instead of net/py-pcapy.
  Because net/py-pcapy-ng conflicts with net/py-pcapy, please uninstall
  py39-pcapy with the following command before upgrading:
  # pkg delete -f py39-pcapy

20230310:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/unifi7
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  The mongodb dependency has been changed from 36 to 44, as MongoDB 3.6
  is long out out support and end of life.

  The upgrade path should be as following:

  1. Take a backup from within the unifi7 application PRIOR to
     updating!

  2. Stop the unifi7 service (if running)

  3. Copy the "backup" directory from LOCALBASE/share/java/unifi/data
     to a safe location. Also copy keystore and system.properties if
     you have made any modifications to those files

  4. Remove files and directories under LOCALBASE/share/java/unifi/data

  5. Upgrade the package

  6. Copy the "backup" directory from a safe location back to
     LOCALBASE/share/java/unifi/data

  7. Start the service

  8. Restore the configuration from backup

  As an optional step, review system.properties and keystore to merge any
  manual modifications you have made (this has to be done with the application
  stopped)

20230310:
  AFFECTS: user of benchmarks/ddosify
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  keep-alive is removed from config file. In default mode, the engine will use
  keep-alive for all requests. If you want to disable keep-alive for a step, you
  can add Connection: close header to the step.

20230306:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.15.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20230304:
  AFFECTS: users of accessibility/atk and accessibilty/at-spi2-atk
  AUTHOR: tcberner@FreeBSD.org

  The packages accessibility/atk and accessibility/at-spi2-atk have been
  integrated upstream into at-spi2-core.

  Users of these packages can manually remove them prior to updating
  accessibility/at-spi2-core using

     pkg delete -f atk at-spi2-atk

  if the pkg update process fails due to conflicting files.

20230227:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/sqlite3
  AUTHOR: fuz@FreeBSD.org

  Option DQS is now disabled by default.  This option controls the "double
  quoted string literals are accepted" quirk, permitting the use of double
  quotes around string literals if enabled.  Users who rely on this quirk
  need to manually build databases/sqlite3 with the DQS option enabled.

20230227:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/py-spf-engine
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Default configuration file path of pyspf-milter has changed. Since
  it looks for ${PREFIX}/etc/etc/pyspf-milter/pyspf-milter.conf now,
  you should edit the file if you run pyspf-milter. Alternatively you
  can specify other configuration file path by setting
  pyspf_milter_conffile variable in /etc/rc.conf.

20230222:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Please make sure that the PostgreSQL server for the NetBox instance is
     running version 11 or higher.  This is because PostgreSQL 10 is
     End-of-Life since November 2022 and Django 4.1 requires PostgreSQL 11
     as a minimum.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20230218:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql57-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: joneum@FreeBSD.org

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.7 to 8.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.7 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.7 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql=5.7

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  # pkg set -o databases/mysql57-client:databases/mysql80-client
  # pkg set -o databases/mysql57-server:databases/mysql80-server
  # pkg upgrade

20230213:
  Affects: users of sysutils/nut*
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  The nut file ownership fixups due to the UID/GID change from uucp/uucp
  to nut/nut may not be desireable for all users. Some users with custom
  file ownership may wish ownership to remain untouched. This revision
  to the nut family of ports/packages allows users to optionally disable
  automatic fixup of nut file ownership.

20230213:
  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Since 1.4.1 ${PREFIX}/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles is empty and
  files to be checked by logcheck are specified in
  ${PREFIX}/etc/logcheck/logcheck.logfiles.d/syslog.logfiles. So if
  you previously edited the former, then you should edit the latter
  now.

20230210:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  Fetchmail now warns about OpenSSL before 1.1.1s or 3.0.7, and rejects wolfSSL
  older than 5.5.1.

20230209:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/jack
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  audio/jack 1.9.22 fixes an issue with latency correction on FreeBSD.
  Latency correction parameters have to be measured again after update.

20230130:
  AFFECTS: users of USES=nodejs, www/node*, www/npm* and www/yarn*
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  The current USES=nodejs has the following issues:
  - www/node is not the default version while www/node16 is.
  - It also means inconsistent naming of node ports.
  - www/npm duplicates with www/npm-node16.
  - www/yarn duplicates with www/yarn-node16.

  The notable changes are introduced to fix the above issues:
  - Rewrite Mk/Uses/nodejs.mk.
  - Add new LTS version of nodejs (www/node18).
  - Add new current version of nodejs (www/node19).
  - Change default nodejs version from 16 to 18 (latest LTS),
  - Use consistent naming for all supported node versions.
  - Convert www/node, www/npm and www/yarn to meta ports.

  After these changes:
  - All supported node versions are named as node{14,16,18,19}.
  - www/node is a meta port which depends on the default version
    (e.g. www/node18)
  - www/npm is a meta port which depends on the default version
    (e.g. www/npm-node18)
  - www/yarn is a meta port which depends on the default version
    (e.g. www/yarn-node18)

20230129:
  AFFECTS: users of benchmarks/ddosify
  AUTHOR: fernape@freebsd.org

  In 0.13.0 some configuration keys have been renamed for consistency. Have a
  look at https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify/releases/tag/v0.13.0 for details.

20230127:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn
  AUTHOR: mandree@freebsd.org

  OpenVPN has been updated to the new upstream release v2.6.0, which
  is quite compatible with v2.5 versions.

  A copy of the latest v2.5.8 port is being kept as security/openvpn25 (or
  openvpn25 package) until end of March 2023.

20230116:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nut and sysutils/nut-devel
  AUTHOR: cy@freebsd.org

  As of PR/268960 Network UPS Tools will now run under its own UID and GID
  instead of uucp. Users who wish to continue using the uucp user and
  group may add NUT_USER=uucp and NUT_GROUP=uucp to their make.conf.

  After upgrading sysutils/nut or sysutils/nut-devel with this patch,
  restart devd. Then restart nut. This will fix up the permissions of
  UPS USB devices and allow nut to start normally.

20230111:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@freebsd.org

  Graylog 5.x and higher effectively constrains ElasticSearch
  dependencies, and in most cases will force a migration to
  OpenSearch 2.x, now available in ports. Plan accordingly.

20230104:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamassassin
  AUTHOR: cy@freebsd.org

  As of spamassassin 4.0.0 (3fdfceb36029) the deprecated HashCash plug-in
  was finally removed. Users using the HashCash plug-in will need to
  remove references to it.

20221226:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zrepl
  AUTHOR: driesm@FreeBSD.org

  The Prometheus metric zrepl_version_daemon has been converted to the
  zrepl_start_time metric. The metric still reports the zrepl verison in a
  label. But the metric value is now the Unix timestamp at the time the
  daemon was started. The Grafana dashboard in dist/grafana has been
  updated.

  The RPC protocol version has also been bumped; all zrepl daemons in a
  setup must be updated and restarted before replication can resume.

20221220:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/unbound_exporter
  AUTHOR: thomas@beingboiled.info

  The config defaults for the log file and certificates have been changed.

  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Many users report that after updating ClamAV to 1.0.0 clamd and
  freshclam fails to start with integrity check error of
  databases. According to the result of investigation it happens with
  following conditions.

  1. ClamAV is built on non-cleanroom environment (that is, neither
     FreeBSD official ClamAV package is used nor the package is built
     by user with poudriere).
  2. math/tomsfastmath is installed in the system that ClamAV is
     built.

  So if the errror happens on you system, uninstall TomsFastMath first
  and then rebuild and reinstall ClamAV. The problem should disappear.

20221128:
  AFFECTS: devel/py-proxmoxer
  AUTHOR: einar@isnic.is

  AuthenticationError Moved

  proxmoxer.backends.https.AuthenticationError was moved to
  proxmoxer.AuthenticationError (the class itself is the same).
  Any imports or references to proxmoxer.backends.https.AuthenticationError
  should be changed to proxmoxer.AuthenticationError.

  ProxmoxResourceBase Removed

  While this should be a fully internal change, the ProxmoxResourceBase
  class was removed. Use ProxmoxResource instead.

  Removed ProxmoxHTTPTicketAuth

  The auth_token and csrf_token arguments are no longer supported. If an
  existing (still valid) token needs to be used, you can pass the token
  as password and proxmoxer will attempt to renew the ticket and retrieve
  a new token and CSRF token.

20221126:
  AFFECTS: textproc/kibana8
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  kibana8 now installs kibana-specific utilities into LOCALBASE/bin as symbolic
  links.

  Please check whether it will overwrite your local files with names same as
  these utilities and if so, please rename them or move out of the way in a
  different manner.

20221126:
  AFFECTS: textproc/elasticsearch8
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  elasticsearch8 now installs elasticsearch-specific utilities into
  LOCALBASE/bin as symbolic links (i.e. elasticsearch-cli and similar).

20221126:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php80
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 8.0 to 8.1.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info \*php80\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php80 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php81.

20221123:
  AFFECTS: x11-wm/jwm
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  jwm 2.4 introduces changes in the configuration.  To convert an existing v2.3
  configuration file using xsltproc, run:

  cp ~/.jwmrc ~/.jwmrc.old
  xsltproc jwm-2.4.xslt ~/.jwmrc.old > ~/.jwmrc

  If you have multiple configuration files, it may be necessary to apply the
  XSLT to some or all of them depending on what configuration options are stored
  in the file.

  the new version:
  # pkg delete apache-solr
  # pkg install apache-solr9
  After this you need to migrate data and migration, for this check the solr
  documentation.

20221015:
  AFFECTS: users of gstreamer1-* when upgrading via port builds on the host
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  The update of the gstreamer1-* ports to 1.20.3 requires a clean install of
  gstreamer1-* ports. In particular, when trying to update ports in-place using
  portupgrade or portmaster, the builds are likely to fail due to dependency
  mismatches. If this is your preferred update path, you need to deinstall
  (pkg delete -f) gstreamer1 and the plugins before reinstalling them from
  the ports tree.
  Note that pkg upgrade will do the right thing: If you use official FreeBSD
  packages or build your own set of packages using poudriere, nothing special
  is needed.

20221012:
  AFFECTS: devel/websvn
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  WebSVN 2.8.0 includes full PHP 8.x support which requires a change from PEAR
  to Composer 2. You must manually install dependencies through it, the ports
  system will not handle it anymore for you since */horde* (PR 266552) has been
  marked as incompatible with PHP 8.x for the time being. See pkg-message for
  detailed instructions.

20221011:
  AFFECTS: users of security/acme.sh
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  This update may break your install if you were using a symlink to
  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/acme.sh.conf - that file is no longer installed. Instead,
  a log rotation configuration is now installed to etc/cron.d/acme.sh.sample
  you should modify etc/cron.d/acme.sh to needs.

  The port now installs a log rotation file to etc/newsyslog.d/acme.sh.sample
  and you you should update etc/newsyslog.d/acme.sh to suit your needs.
  This file has long been part of the port, but was never installed.

  Neither the log rotation nor the crontab are active until you remove the
  comments.

20221002:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  Bash has been updated to version 5.2. In previous versions, the default port
  option-set used to link against libreadline from ports. However, the current
  version of devel/readline is too old for bash 5.2.

  For now, the default option has been switched to use the bundled version of
  libreadline and the other option is marked broken. Once devel/readline is
  updated this can be reverted.

  If you're updating bash from source and you've previously explicitly set to
  use use PORTS_READLINE, you'll have to disable the PORTS_READLINE option
  before updating:

  # cd /usr/ports/shells/bash
  # make config

   or flush it entirely:

  # cd /usr/ports/shells/bash
  # make rmconfig

20220903:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The Vim port no longer installs a system-wide vimrc. It drastically affected
  config loading order, and led to various settings being clobbered, duplicated,
  or ignored.

  Vim's provided defaults.vim (/usr/local/share/vim/vim90/defaults.vim) continues
  to be read just as before, but its settings are no longer clobbered. Take a look

20220626:
  AFFECTS: users of python
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of python3 and python was switched to 3.9.

  For ports users wanting to keep version 3.8 as default,
  add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= python=3.8 python3=3.8 to make.conf

  Following procedures may ease the upgrade:

  For users of pre-build packages:
  # sh
  # for i in $(pkg query -g %n 'py38-*'); do pkg set -yn ${i}:py39-${i#py38-}; done
  # pkg upgrade

  For portmaster users:
  # sh
  # portmaster -o lang/python39 python38
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o "*py38*" | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f "*py38*"
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # REBUILD=$(pkg query -g "%n:%dn" '*' | grep py3 | grep -v py39 | cut -d : -f 1 | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD
  # REBUILD2=$(pkg list | grep python-38 | xargs pkg which | awk '{print $6}' | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD2

  Final steps (for pre-built packages & portmaster):

  If no longer required, Python 3.8 can be removed via
  "pkg remove python38" and the directory /usr/local/lib/python3.8 can
  then be deleted afterwards, if not empty.

20220625:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/fusefs-bindfs
  AUTHOR: doralitze@chaotikum.org

  Bindfs defaults to use direct I/O since version 1.16. While this results
  in major performance improvements as well as several bug fixes, this also
  breaks direct legacy calls to mmap. If your application still uses them
  consider these two options:

  1. Mount using `--no-direct-io`
  2. Upgrade your application in order to query mapping guards

20220623:
  AFFECTS: users of science/gramps
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  databases/py-bsddb3 is deprecated and will be removed in the future. With that
  gramps will lose the ability to load family trees using Berkeley DB.
  It is suggested to migrate all family trees using Berkeley DB by exporting
  them to gramps xml and import that gramps xml into a family tree using sqlite
  as database.

20220620:
  AFFECTS: users of www/selenium
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  The port has changed startup args so if you are using selenium_args= in
  rc.conf you need to add the parameter "standalone" manually.

20220616:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  The NetBox 3.2 release contains major changes, so at least items 1.), 2.)
  and 3.) must be checked before proceeding with the upgrade!

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  1. This release includes a database migration that will remove the "asn",
     "contact_name", "contact_phone", and "contact_email" fields from the
     site model.  (These fields have been superseded by the ASN and contact
     models introduced in NetBox v3.1.)

     To protect against the accidental destruction of data, the upgrade
     process will fail if any sites still have data in any of these fields.

     To bypass this safeguard, set the NETBOX_DELETE_LEGACY_DATA environment
     variable when running the upgrade script, which will permit the
     destruction of legacy data.

     A set of migration scripts is available to assist with the migration of
     legacy site data:

     https://github.com/netbox-community/migration-scripts

  2. NetBox v3.2 requires Python 3.8 or later.

  3. If the NetBox Plugin "net-mgmt/py-netbox-plugin-extension" is used,
     please disable it before the migrations are applied.  This can be done
     by removing the entry "netbox_plugin_extensions" from the "PLUGINS"
     section in the NetBox configuration.

     Once the upgrade is done, this port/package can be safely removed as
     it's no longer required.

  4. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20220608:
  AFFECTS: devel/autoconf-wrapper, devel/autoconf213
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  These ports have been renamed to devel/autoconf-switch and devel/autoconf2.13
  respectively.  If your favourite port updating tool cannot handle that then
  just remove the packages with "pkg delete" and then install the new port.

20220607:
  AFFECTS: security/openssh-portable
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  OpenSSH has been updated to 9.0p1 with incompatible changes.
  See https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.0 for details.

20220602:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  Graylog 4.3.0+ fails to start if graylog's internal collector for
  system statistics is enabled. This will eventually be addressed
  upstream.

  Add disable_native_system_stats_collector=true to your graylog.conf.

20220513:
  AFFECTS: devel/nexus2-oss
  AUTHOR: michael.osipov@siemens.com

  Nexus 2.15.x introduces incompatible configuration changes. You
  must review changes in ETCDIR/wrapper.conf and ETCDIR/jetty*.xml
  with updated samples as well as NEXUS_WORKDIR/conf/logback-nexus.xml
  with its origin from
  DATADIR/nexus/WEB-INF/lib/nexus-core-VERSION.jar!/META-INF/log/logback-nexus.xml,
  grant write access to files in ETCDIR since Nexus itself might
  update files in place otherwise your instance will not properly
  work after the update.

20220510
  AFFECTS: sysutils/zrepl
  AUTHOR: monwarez@gmail.com

  The zrepl update to 0.5.0.8 includes the following breaking changes:
  - The Prometheus metric zrepl_version_daemon was converted to zrepl_start_time
  The metric still reports the zrepl version in a label.
  But the metric *value* is now the Unix timestamp at the time the daemon was started.
  The Grafana dashboard in zrepl examples directory has been updated.

20220502:
  AFFECTS: mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  Default header cache option has been changed to the new option LMDB using
  databases/lmdb. The BDB option still exists but now uses databases/db18 due
  to the EOL of databases/db5.

20220501:
  AFFECTS: users of drm-current-kmod and drm-devel-kmod
  AUTHOR: manu@FreeBSD.org

  Both ports where removed.
  If you were using either one of them directly (i.e. without using
  graphics/drm-kmod metaport) use graphics/drm-510-kmod.
  If you have some problems with this one try drm-54-kmod and report
  a bug on https://github.com/freebsd/drm-kmod.

20220428:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to 7.0. Users wanting to
  stay on 6.2 can replace databases/redis with databases/redis62 with
  one of the following commands.

  If you use pkg with binary packages:
    # pkg set -o databases/redis:databases/redis62
    # pkg upgrade
  If you use portmaster:
    # portmaster -o databases/redis62 databases/redis
  If you use portupgrade:
    # portupgrade -o databases/redis62 databases/redis

20220426:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/grantleetheme
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The pkg update of deskutils/grantleetheme to 22.04 can fail due
  to a filesystem location having changed from being a file to being
  a directory. This leads to pkg's temporary file creation throwing
  an error.

  To update to KDE Gear 22.04 please run
  # pkg delete -f grantleetheme
  prior to the update.

20220424:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu has been updated to 7.0.0. Previous 6.2.X branch has
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu6. If someone wants to stick with 6.2.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install qemu6/qemu6-nox11(based on flavor used)
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu6 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu6 emulators/qemu

20220421:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby27
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.7 to 3.0.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.7 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.7 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.7

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20220413:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  AUTHOR: ports@skyforge.at

  Synapse will now refuse to start up if open registration is enabled,
  in order to help mitigate abuse across the federation. If you would
  like to provide registration to anyone, consider adding email,
  recaptcha or token-based verification in order to prevent automated
  registration from bad actors. This check can be disabled by setting
  the enable_registration_without_verification option in your
  homeserver configuration file to true. More details are available in
  the upgrade notes[0].

  Synapse will additionally now refuse to start when using PostgreSQL
  with a non-C values for COLLATE and CTYPE, unless the config flag
  allow_unsafe_locale, found in the database section of the
  configuration file, is set to true. See the upgrade notes[1] for
  details.

20220410:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/screen
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  As of sysutils/screen-4.9.0_5, the MULTUSER option is default, reverting
  to the traditional setuid-root behavior. People who wish to secure their
  screen install must terminate all screen sessions, then install screen
  without the MULTIUSER option. The option was reversed because it caused
  too much astonishment among users of screen.

20220401:
  AFFECTS: security/sshguard
  AUTHOR: kevinz5000@gmail.com

  Blacklisting is now disabled by default to avoid overriding the setting in
  sshguard.conf. To enable blacklisting, uncomment the BLACKLIST_FILE line in
  sshguard.conf.

20220329:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/screen
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  As of sysutils/screen-4.9.0_3, the multiuser feature is not supported
  by default. The multiuser feature requires setuid root to function.
  This creates a security risk. Some Linux distributions have had
  non-setuuid root screen for a dozen or more years. FreeBSD is following
  suit. A new MULTIUSER option has been added to enable users to install
  setuid root screen. The MULTIUSER option default is OFF.

  Users who wish to use the multiuser feature may,

  - Build screen using the MULTIUSER option, or
  - Poudriere users can use poudriere-options to enable the MULTIUSER
    option, or
  - Users can chmod the setuid bit for ${LOCALBASE}/bin/screen-4.9.0,
    making screen setuid root to enable the multiuser feature.

20220326:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/freebsd-doc-*
  AUTHOR: blackend@FreeBSD.org

  A change to the doc toolchain prevents the build of individual
  localized HTML versions of the documentation without building the
  en_US version.  HTML option is currently disabled until a good
  solution is found.  PDF version, the default option, is now the only
  available option.

  Please re-run "make config" to pick up this new default.

20220313:
  AFFECTS: users of net/unison
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  unison has been updated to version 2.52. The new version introduces
  a new wire protocol and on disk archive format. This new version
  is compatible with 2.51 clients for communication, so it's now
  possible to upgrade one side and then the other.

  The archive files are automatically converted to the new version,
  but once they are converted the y are incompatible with the
  previous version.

  In case you need version 2.51, the previous version of the port
  is preserved in net/unison251.

20220311:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/get_iplayer
  AUTHOR: jamie@catflap.org

  get_iplayer has a number of changes to quality settings that may
  break existing configurations. Please see the release notes for
  further information:

  https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/release320to329#release329

20220311:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  In order to comply to hier(7), VirtualBox's configuration of non-default
  IP ranges to be used in host-only mode moved from /etc/vbox/networks.conf
  to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/vbox/networks.conf.

20220311:
  AFFECTS: users of net/nats-server
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  A dedicated 'nats' user was added, replacing 'nobody' in the startup script.
  You should check your configuration and assign updated ownership to your data
  files.

20220227:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/bmeps
  AUTHOR: takefu@airport.fm

  The binary and man page have been renamed from bmpp{.1.gz} to bitmap2pp{.1.gz}

20220225:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/py-wxPython40
  AUTHOR: lbartoletti@FreeBSD.org

  x11-toolkits/py-wxPython40 has been removed to be replaced by the 4.1
  version.
  However the new wxPython ports is now named x11-toolkits/py-wxPython4.

  Depending on the tools you use, you may have to remove the port
  before ports upgrade.

20220224:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/openfire
  AUTHOR: nikita@druba.su

  The port version have been updated from 4.6.x to 4.7.x.
  It is recommended to do database and configs backup before updating.

20220219:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/intel-pcm-devel
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/intel-pcm-devel became quite obsolete once sysutils/intel-pcm is
  now pretty much following a constant and stable update cycle, so users of
  the -devel version are encouraged to switch to it.

  If you still have sysutils/intel-pcm-devel installed, please delete it from
  your system and install sysutils/intel-pcm instead:

  # pkg delete sysutils/intel-pcm-devel
  # pkg install sysutils/intel-pcm

20220219:
  AFFECTS: users of math/qhull*
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  Because of entries in MOVED, portupgrade can get confused updating qhull.
  It is recommended that you delete qhull and ports depending upon it, and
  then reinstalling all the dependent ports.

20220218:
  AFFECTS: users of TeX*
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  TeX system has been updated to 2021 from 2015. Normal pkg upgrade or
  portmaster -a should handle all the upgrade properly. In case not please
  create a ticket or send a mail to tex@FreeBSD.org

  print/tex-aleph has been removed as per upstream. This package should be
  removed manually. Additionally users have reported to delete
  texlive-texmf prior to starting update, or pkg-static will indicate
  there is a conflict during the upgrade of texlive-base :

  # pkg remove tex-aleph texlive-texmf

20220218:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The storage directory has moved from WWWDIR to /var/db/librenms/storage
  to comply with man 7 hier. When upgrading, you may need to manually create
  this symlink.

20220212:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php8[01][-extensions]?
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  Non-Default OPTION MYSQL80 has been removed in lieu of making
  php8[01]-openssl as part of DEFAULT php8[01] installation. Although
  for php74 it is not the case. Ports that depends on
  security/php8[01]-openssl will no longer be installed as these have
  been removed. There is no side effect of this for ports which have
  USE_PHP=openssl. In case for php74 as the default php74-openssl will
  be installed otherwise it will be used from php installation.

  If you are using pkg, you have to remove php8[01]-openssl manually after
  the upgrade :

  # pkg info \*php8\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  # pkg upgrade -y
  # pkg delete -f php8[01]-openssl
  # service -R

  While rebuilding from ports users old php.conf is not overwritten. So
  have to manually remove the ports. For portmaster users:
  # sh
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o "*php80*" | grep -v openssl | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f "*php80*"
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # portmaster -a

20220207:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  Amavis does now depend on archivers/7-zip (7zz) you might need to update
  your amavisd.conf and replace all ocurances of p7zip (7zr) accordingly.

20220129:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/neovim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Neovim now uses luajit-openresty as the Lua provider. Many neovim plugins
  compile some of their code (Packer does this, as do many LSP plugins).
  Neovim will produce errors and fail to load the plugins.

  Deleting and reinstalling any plugins that produce errors should fix the
  startup.

  If you use Packer, you also want to delete the startup cache:

  # rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/plugin/packer_compiled.lua

20220128:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/source-sans-ttf
  AUTHOR: fernape@FreeBSD.org

  The font name has changed its prefix from SourceSansPro* to SourceSans*.
  Users of this font might need to change their configurations to pick up
  the new names.

20220128:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/dendrite
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  The configuration needs to be updated to version 2 following upgrade to
  Dendrite v0.6. Please refer to /usr/local/etc/dendrite/dendrite.yaml.sample
  for a sample configuration.

20220127:
  AFFECTS: users of PyQt
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Most of the PyQt ports have been merged into single port devel/py-qt5-pyqt.
  `pkg upgrade` will handle update automatically .

20220126:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/bogofilter, mail/bogofilter-lmdb
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of mail/bogofilter now uses LMDB instead
  of Berkeley DB. It is not compatible and cannot read databases.

  Your options are:
  1. use bogoutil on each wordlist for each of your users first,
  ONLY THEN reinstall bogofilter, THEN reload the databases with bogoutil,
  OR
  2. install the matching bogofilter version and
  If you had been using bogofilter-lmdb so far, install bogofilter.
  If you had been using bogofilter so far, install bogofilter-bdb.

20220125:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php74
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.4 to 8.0.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info \*php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php74 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php80.

20220120:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/dwm
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  dwm has been updated to 6.3. The option RUGAPS is no longer available because
  it depends on a patch only available for version 6.2. RUGAPS can be
  reintroduced if desired once it is ported to 6.3 by the interested party.

20220118:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Please make sure that the PostgreSQL server for the NetBox instance is
     running version 10 or higher.  This is because PostgreSQL 9.6 is
     End-of-Life since November 2021 and NetBox 3.1 makes use of the
     "macaddr8" field which was introduced with PostgreSQL 10.

  2. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-utils
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  New port emulators/qemu@tools has been introduced which is similar to
  emulators/qemu-utils. qemu-utils has also been DEPRECATED in favor for
  this as it's MASTER port has also been marked DEPRECATED and set to
  expire on 2022-01-09. For updating to qemu-tools please use one of
  the following command:

  # pkg install qemu-tools
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu-utils emulators/qemu@tools

20211116:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu50
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu50 has been moved to emulators/qemu5 and updated to 5.2.0
  which is the last version from 5.X.X branch. This is done in preparation
  of updating emulators/qemu into latest 6.X branch. If someone wants to
  stick with 5.X.X branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install qemu5
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu50 emulators/qemu5

  This version also introduces a stripped nox11 version which can be
  installed with:
  # pkg install qemu5-nox11
   or
  # portmaster emulators/qemu5@nox11

20211115:
  AFFECTS: AFFECTS: users of *-emacs2x-* packages
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  To avoid problems when editors/emacs or editors/emacs-devel are
  updated, the emacs major version has been removed from these package
  names.

  For example, the old and new package names of devel/magit are

  -----------------------------------------------------------
  | Old Package Name          | New Package Name            |
  |-------------------------- |-----------------------------|
  | magit-emacs27             | magit                       |
  | magit-emacs27_nox         | magit-emacs_nox             |
  | magit-emacs27_canna       | magit-emacs_canna           |
  |                           |                             |
  | magit-emacs29_nox         | magit-emacs_devel_nox       |
  | magit-emacs29             | magit-emacs_devel           |
  -----------------------------------------------------------

  To handle these final package name changes, follow a similar procedure
  as the one described in the 20200811 entry.  That is, simply running
  `pkg upgrade` will not upgrade, e.g., foo-emacs27_nox to
  foo-emacs_nox.

  Binary package users:

  To update these packages, run these commands under /bin/sh with superuser
  privileges before upgrading.

  # default flavor of editors/emacs installed
  for i in $(pkg query -g %n '*-emacs27'); do
    if [ "$i" != "notmuch-emacs27" ]; then
      nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/-emacs27//')
    else
      nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/-emacs27/-emacs/')
    fi

  AFFECTS: users of www/node*, www/npm*, www/yarn*
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The port framework was updated to use a default version for nodejs.
  The default version is pointing to the latest LTS version which is
  currently version 16.
  You can overwrite this by defining in /etc/make.conf, e.g. version 17:
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS=nodejs=17

  Or if you would like to stick always to the current version use:
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS=nodejs=current

  If you would like to use yarn or npm together with nodejs version 17,
  just install the package that is pulling the wanted dependency to nodejs:

  # pkg install yarn-node17
  # pkg install npm-node17

20211109:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 3.4 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies.

20211107:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/devcpu-data
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  The RC variable name microcode_cpus is now deprecated.  Users should
  instead use the variable microcode_update_cpus.

  Two new ports were branched from sysutils/devcpu-data,
  sysustils/devcpu-data-amd and sysustils/devcpu-data-intel.  The two
  new ports contain only the CPU microcode updates for each vendor and
  sysutils/devcpu-data now only contains an RC script.  Both new ports
  are on-by-default, optional dependencies of sysutils/devcpu-data.

20211101:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/redisearch
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/redisearch port has been updated to the recent stable
  release - v2.2.  Users wanting to stay on v2.0 can replace
  textproc/redisearch with textproc/redisearch20 with one of the
  following commands:

  # pkg install textproc/redisearch20
    or
  # portmaster -o textproc/redisearch20 textproc/redisearch
    or
  # portupgrade -o textproc/redisearch20 textproc/redisearch

  NOTE: The textproc/redisearch20 brings a new name for the module,
  i.e. redisearch20.so, so be careful.

20211024:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/beats7
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  The following breaking changes apply to beats 7.15.0 and newer:

    - All beats:
    Loading Kibana assets (dashboards, index templates) rely on Saved Object API.
    So to provide a reliable service, Beats can only import and export dashboards
    using at least Kibana 7.15.

    - Filebeat:
      - Remove all alias fields pointing to ECS fields from modules. This affects
        the Suricata and Traefik modules.
      - Fix Crowdstrike ingest pipeline that was creating flattened process fields.
      - Rename log.path to log.file.path in filestream to be consistent with log
        input and ECS.

    - Heartbeat:
      - Remove long deprecated watch_poll functionality.
      - Fix inconsistency in event.dataset values between heartbeat and fleet by
        always setting this value to the monitor type / fleet dataset.

    - Metricbeat:
      - Fix Elasticsearch jvm.gc.collectors.old being exposed as young

20211024:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 12 to 13.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 12.8, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql12-server postgresql12-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql12-server-12.8.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql12-contrib-12.8.pkg -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib databases/postgresql12-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql13-server databases/postgresql13-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data13 -U postgres"
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /var/db/postgres/data12/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data13/ -U postgres "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres" in 11. The migration steps above now assume
     the "postgres" database user and FreeBSD user.
  2) See the updating entry 20190829 if you are updating from a release prior to 11.
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20211023:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v17.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node16, has been created for the
  upcoming v16.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v16.x can replace
  www/node with www/node16 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node16
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node16 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node16 www/node

20211012:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  devel/git port was split into multiple sub-ports that depend on devel/git
  and install additional files:

  - devel/git-cvs - CVS related scripts and man pages
  - devel/git-gui - GUI related scripts and man pages
  - devel/git-p4  - Perforce related scripts and man pages
  - devel/git-svn - Subversion related scripts and man pages

  Due to these changes, CVS, GUI, PERFORCE, and SUBVERSION options
  as well as gui and svn flavors were removed from the port.

20211010:
  AFFECTS: users of gtk2 flavored devel/geany*
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream dropped support for gtk2. Due to this the ports are now
  unflavored, installing only with gtk3 support.

  If you are already using the default gtk3 flavor will get the new
  version with a simple "pkg upgrade".

  To upgrade when using the gtk2 flavors you need to use "pkg install"
  to install the new unflavored gtk3 packages, pkg will automatically
  uninstall the old gtk2 flavors.

  If using ports, you will need to uninstall all geany packages and
  its plugins and reinstall from an updated ports tree.

  The "geany-plugin-multiterm" plugin was only available as a gtk2
  flavor when installing the gtk2 flavor of geany and has not been
  ported to gtk3, so has been removed from the tree, so the
  geany-plugin-multiterm-gtk2 package should be removed from the system.

20211007:
  AFFECTS: user of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: yasu@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream changed end-of-life policy and introduced long time support
  (LTS) feature release.

  * LTS feature release will be identified approximately every two
    years and supported for at least three years from the initial
    publication date of that LTS feature version.
  * Regular (non-LTS) feature releases will be supported for at least
    four months from the initial publication date of the next feature
    release or until the feature release after that is published.

  According to it new port security/clamav-lts is added for users who
  want to use LTS version of ClamAV.

  Users wanting to switch to LTS version can replace security/clamav
  with security/clamav-lts with one of following commands.

  If you use pkg with binary packages:
    # pkg set -o security/clamav:security/clamav-lts
    # pkg upgrade
  If you use portmaster:
    # portmaster -o security/clamav-lts security/clamav
  If you use portupgrade:
    # portupgrade -o security/clamav-lts security/clamav

20211006:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/freebsd-doc-*
  AUTHOR: blackend@FreeBSD.org

The misc/freebsd-doc-* ports have been updated to the new doc toolchain,
and use a somewhat different arrangement of directories and symlinks,
which pkg 1.17 does not handle well.

Users are encouraged to delete the misc/freebsd-doc-* ports, then
reinstall the new ones without using the pkg upgrade facility.

20211006:
  AFFECTS: users of net/kafkacat
  AUTHOR: sergey@akhmatov.ru

  kafkacat has been renamed to kcat upstream.
  So switch to net/kcat instead.

20211004:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  The NetBox 3.0 release contains major changes, so at least items 1.), 2.)
  and 3.) must be checked before proceeding with the upgrade!

  /!\ WARNING /!\

  1. Please ensure that your local installation of net-mgmt/netbox is at
     the 2.11 release before attempting to upgrade to NetBox 3.0 or later.

  2. Please also note that the previously deprecated secrets functionality
     has been removed with NetBox 3.0.  This means, all of the secrets still
     remain in the database once upgraded, only the secrets functionality on
     the part of NetBox is no longer given.

     In order to continue to be able to access the stored secrets as usual
     (and then possibly migrate them to another solution, e.g.
     security/vault), please install the security/py-netbox-secretstore port
     once NetBox has been upgraded to 3.x and follow its installation
     instructions how to enable the plugin.

  3. If plugins are used, they should be temporarily deactivated to avoid
     disruptions during the upgrade process.

  4. Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20211004:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-pyjwt
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@FreeBSD.org

  To make it possible to easily import py-pyjwt v2.x the current port was
  moved to a versioned directory.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -o www/py-pyjwt1 www/py-pyjwt
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fo www/py-pyjwt1 www/py-pyjwt
  If you use pkg with binary packages:
        pkg set -o www/py-pyjwt:www/py-pyjwt1

  AFFECTS: x11-wm/cage, x11-wm/hikari, x11-wm/labwc, x11-wm/sway, x11-wm/wayfire
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  SUID option has been removed in favor of seatd-launch(1) which doesn't
  require special handling in every consumer and doesn't bypass group
  permissions. If you've already enabled seatd service or use consolekit2
  then nothing changes. Otherwise,

    $ sway
    00:00:00.001 [ERROR] [wlr] [libseat] [libseat/libseat.c:83] No backend was able to open a seat
    00:00:00.001 [ERROR] [wlr] [backend/session/session.c:84] Unable to create seat: Function not implemented

    00:00:00.001 [ERROR] [sway/server.c:53] Unable to create backend

  can be fixed by

    $ ck-launch-session sway

  or

    $ seatd-launch sway

  or

    # sysrc seatd_enable=YES
    # service seatd start
    $ sway

  Replace "sway" with your compositor e.g., "cage", "hikari", "labwc", "wayfire".

20210907:
  AFFECTS: consumers of math/eigen[23]
  AUTHOR: adridg@FreeBSD.org

  math/eigen2 has been marked deprecated. There do not seem to be any
  consumers in FreeBSD ports.

  math/eigen3 has had its options re-vamped. The default options previously
  pulled in multiple useless library dependencies. The options also forced
  a specific BLAS implementation. The new options depend only on the
  default BLAS (whatever USES=blaslapack picks), but this can be turned
  off. The previous multiple useless libraries -- which are not useless
  when running the tests in Eigen -- are now hidden behind the default-off
  TEST option.

  Users of a carefully-tuned Eigen build should re-evaluate the options
  available.

20210902:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The vim ports have been completely reworked to take advantage of flavors.

  The biggest change is that the `vim' package is now console-only. If
  you want the GTk3 GUI, you'll need to install the `vim-gtk3' package
  instead. All the GUI toolkits have their own package now: vim-gtk3,
  vim-gtk2, -athena, -motif, and -x11. The vim-tiny package still exists.

  Also: only python3 bindings are included now. There are very few plugins
  written in Perl or Ruby, so there really wasn't a need to bundle those
  languages with Vim. They still exist as OPTIONS, so you can still enable
  them if you'd like. Also, support for py27 has been dropped.

20210901:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/ampache
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  With the upgrade to Ampache 5.0.0, the root Ampache folder has changed
  to %%WWWDIR%%/ampache/public.  Please update your web server aliases,
  for example if you use Apache, then in httpd.conf make sure the lines
  look like this:

  Alias /ampache /usr/local/www/ampache/public

  <Directory "/usr/local/www/ampache/public">

  If you have customised your .htaccess files to allow for a different
  alias, you'll need to move them to the new location after upgrading:

  # sh -c 'cd /usr/local/www/ampache && for f in */.htaccess; do mv $f public/$f; done'

  More upgrade notes can be found on Github:

  https://github.com/ampache/ampache/releases/tag/5.0.0

20210823:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mu
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mu now uses XDG Base Directory Specification for the default
  locations for various files.  The mu database now lives under
  ~/.cache/mu rather than ~/.mu by default.  After upgrading,
  move the contents under ~/.mu to ~/.cache/mu.

20210823:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfixadmin
  AUTHOR: ports.maintainer@evilphi.com

  The 3.2->3.3 upgrade requires generating a new setup password hash.

  databases/redis6 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install databases/redis6
    or
  # portmaster -o databases/redis6 databases/redis
    or
  # portupgrade -o databases/redis6 databases/redis

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/beats7
  AUTHOR: otis@FreeBSD.org

  Beats may not be sending data to some distributions of Elasticsearch

  In this release, Elastic is enabling a licensing change that was broadly
  communicated earlier in 2021. This change would imply that 7.13 instances of
  Beats would fail to connect to 7.10 or earlier open source distributions of
  Elasticsearch and Kibana.

  The most visible effect is that sysutils/beats7 users can expect
  difficulties to send data to Elastic instances hosted in AWS.

  Changing "*." to "." should make your bindings work again.

20210704:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/qtchooser
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  QtChooser allows you to select your version of Qt among those installed.
  However, this tool is no longer supported upstream and will not be
  available for Qt6.

  By default, our Qt installations are done in:
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/qt${QT_VERSION} as recommended.
  We have added symbolic linking for the main binaries to
  ${LOCALBASE}/bin with the suffix -qt5.

20210620:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/openhab2
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The openhab v3 port has been committed. Upstream has removed the
  version from the name, as such the FreeBSD port follows in all places
  (start script name, directory names, ...).
  Users are encouraged to migrate from misc/openhab2 to misc/openhab.

  No automatic config migration is available Both versions can be
  installed in parallel, but an users has to take care to not run
  both at the same time on the same port.

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/mesa-libs and x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  Some libraries from mesa-libs are now provided by libglvnd while
  others were renamed. nvidia-driver already used libglvnd but bundled
  a copy which is now provided as a separate package. When building
  outside poudriere make sure to remove mesa-libs and nvidia-driver
  first in order to avoid conflict with libglvnd.

  OpenEXR and/or ilmbase according to INDEX were patched,
  for ports where OpenEXR is an option that defaults to off, these
  typical items needs to be changed - file bug reports in that case,
  preferably with tested patches:

  - The IlmBase parts Imath and half are now repackaged as Imath
  - The IlmThread and Iex libraries are now part of OpenEXR
  - Some header files were rearranged accordingly, into
    ${LOCALBASE}/include/OpenEXR vs. ${LOCALBASE}/include/Imath
  - Some code needs a few #include statements added, often
    #include <ImfHeader.h> or #include <ImfFrameBuffer.h>
  - Some classes were removed, and the C++11 standard library
    features need to be used, f. i. std::numeric_limits.
  - Some code used Int64 or SInt64 should use uint64_t or int64_t.

  AFFECTS: users of x11-fonts/oldschool-pc-fonts
  AUTHOR: evgeniy@khramtsov.org

  x11-fonts/oldschool-pc-fonts has been upgraded to 2.2. This version
  changed names of many fonts. If you have configuration files with
  specific font names set, you need to update your configurations
  after upgrade.

20210406:
  AFFECTS: users of www/phpvirtualbox
  AUTHOR: dereks@lifeofadishwasher.com

  www/phpvirtualbox has been updated to version 6.1. This new version
  only supports version 6.1 of VirtualBox.

  Version 5.x of phpvirtualbox has been preserved as
  www/phpvirtualbox-legacy. If you require support for VirtualBox
  5.x please install this version. Remember to copy your configuration
  file in the new legacy installation.

20210328:
  AFFECTS: users of www/caddy
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The default locations for caddy runtime files have changed.

  - Caddy's runtime log is now /var/log/caddy/caddy.log
    (was /var/log/caddy.log)

  - Automatic SSL certs are now stored in /var/db/caddy/data/caddy
    (was /root/.local/share/caddy)

  - Configuration autosaves are now stored in /var/db/caddy/config/caddy
    (was /root/.config/caddy)

  You can change these defaults. See /usr/local/etc/rc.d/caddy for the
  list of settings.

20210322:
  AFFECTS: users of net/wireguard
  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  A wireguard kernel implementation supporting FreeBSD 12.1 and newer was
  added as net/wireguard-kmod recently.

  The new default for users of net/wireguard is the kernel module.

  If you experience problems with it you can switch back to wireguard-go
  by removing net/wireguard-kmod and making sure net/wireguard-go is
  installed.
  The userland tools wg-quick(8) and wg(8) try to use kernel support if
  the kernel module is available and otherwise fall back to wireguard-go
  automatically. Config files are fully compatible.

20210317:
  AFFECTS: users of security/strongswan
  AUTHOR: driesm@FreeBSD.org

  The stroke starter interface has been deprecated by upstream
  for some time now.  The default interface for controlling the charon
  daemon has switched from stroke to vici. Users still using the
  legacy config files such as ipsec.conf and ipsec.secret (stroke, starter)
  can easily revert to the old behavior by:

  # sysrc strongswan_interface="stroke"

  It is recommended to use the vici interface which is configured by swanctl.conf.
  Check : https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/Fromipsecconf
  to ease the transition from ipsec.* to swanctl.conf

20210313:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/phpipam
  AUTHOR: marko.cupac@mimar.rs

  ipaddresses table in phpipam database is likely to contain incorrect datetime
  values which prevent successful upgrade.  Make sure to create backup of
  phpipam database.  Before starting upgrade wizard in web interface run the
  following SQL query on phpipam database:

    UPDATE ipaddresses SET lastSeen='1970-01-01 00:00:01' WHERE lastSeen < '0000-01-01 00:00:00';

20210310:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/redisearch
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/redisearch port has been updated to the recent stable
  release - v2.0.  Users wanting to stay on v1.6 can replace
  textproc/redisearch with textproc/redisearch16 with one of the
  following commands:

  # pkg install textproc/redisearch16
    or
  # portmaster -o textproc/redisearch16 textproc/redisearch
    or
  # portupgrade -o textproc/redisearch16 textproc/redisearch

  NOTE: The textproc/redisearch16 brings a new name for the module,
  i.e. redisearch16.so, so be careful.

20210309:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/virtualbox-ose has been updated to 6.1.18. This new
  version only works on amd64 hardware.

  Previous version 5.x of the virtualbox ports have been preserved
  as emulators/virtualbox-ose-legacy and similarly named ports for
  the other parts.

  If you can't run the latest version or wish to stay with the old
  version, please install the legacy ports.

  Also the additions at present build successfully only for amd64.
  If you need i386 additions you can fallback to the old legacy
  ones.

  NOTE: There is no support for moving saved running machine states
  across major updates of virtualbox. It is recommended to properly
  shutdown all virtual machines before upgrading. Otherwise the saved
  state can simply be discarded after the upgrade, if it's not
  important to preserve it.

  It should also be possible to downgrade to the legacy ports and
  shutdown the machine properly from the saved state and then upgrade
  back again.

20210302:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs-devel
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  If you get the error "Symbol's value as variable is void: minor-modes",
  rebuild the offending Emacs packages.  See
  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2021-02/msg01164.html
  for details.

20210220:
  AFFECTS: users of math/py-mathics
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  math/py-mathics has been split into several ports, and Mathics Core
  only provides a rudimentary command-line shell called mathics.
  To get the same functionality as in 1.x, you need to install either
  mathicsscript or Mathics-Django.

20210219:
  AFFECTS: users of games/mangband
  AUTHOR: adridg@FreeBSD.org

  The client has updated from 1.1.3 (which has a single public server
  left) to the current 1.5.3 (which has more public servers). If you
  update, you can NOT connect to the old server any more. Remember
  to finish your game before updating.

20210210:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/spotifyd
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@FreeBSD.org

  The configuration format for audio/spotifyd is now TOML, make
  sure to update your configuration file after upgrading the port.
  Look at the sample configuration file for a working example.

20210208:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailscanner
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  The clamavmodule has finally been removed after a long deprecation
  period.  Please remove all references to it in your mailscanner.conf as
  it will now count as a syntax error and may stop MailScanner starting!

20210204:
  AFFECTS: users of www/unit
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for NGINX Unit's state directory has changed.  It
  was moved from /usr/local/libexec/unit to /var/db/unit in order to
  avoid write operations on /usr/local filesystem.

20210130:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opencv-core
  AUTHOR: tcberner@FreeBSD.org

  graphics/opencv-core has been reintegrated into graphics/opencv.
  So there is no longer a circular dependency
     opencv-core -> ffmpeg -> opencv

  If you experience problems updating the packages, try
      pkg delete -f opencv-core

20210124:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  The Django templating language (DTL) is no longer supported for export
  templates.  Please ensure that all export templates use Jinja2 before
  upgrading.

  Also the support for embedded graphs was completely removed and several
  changes to the REST API were made.  Please check the changelogs for
  further details.

20210114:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/matterircd
  AUTHOR: norrland@nullbyte.se

  Commandline switches

  Switched to viper for cmdline parsing, which does not support "short" flags.
  You'll need to use --flag instead of -flag. Eg ./matterircd --debug
  Bridge specific configuration is now only in configuration file. This means
  the following flags have been removed: -restrict,-mmteam,-mmserver,
  -mminsecure,-mmskiptlsverify.
  You can set those in matterircd.toml, see the example file.

  Config changes

  BlacklistUser feature for slack has been renamed to DenyUsers.
  JoinMpImOnTalk feature has been renamed to JoinDM and is available for
  slack/mattermost
  JoinInclude, JoinExclude now support regexp (see matterircd.toml.example)

20210113:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis[-devel]
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/redis port has been updated to the recent stable release.
  Users wanting to stay on v5.x can replace databases/redis with
  databases/redis5 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install databases/redis5
    or
  # portmaster -o databases/redis5 databases/redis
    or
  # portupgrade -o databases/redis5 databases/redis

20210106:
  AFFECTS: mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  The VPOPMAIL option was removed, because it was dropped upstream,
  so please check your config before upgrading.

20210106:
  AFFECTS: sysutils/graylog
  AUTHOR: dch@FreeBSD.org

  graylog 4.0 and higher now use a new license, the SSPL. For more
  details, see https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl

20210102:
  AFFECTS: x11/libexo, XFCE4 desktop users
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  XFCE4 has been updated to version 4.16. Unluckily due to how the
  update works out it interacts badly with a defect in pkg which can
  cause files from the libexo package to be absent after upgrade.

  To avoid the issue, before upgrading all packages, please update
  libexo by itself:

  # pkg upgrade libexo
  # pkg upgrade

  If you have already upgraded and you notice XFCE issues due to
  missing libraries you can recover easily by forcing reinstallation
  of libexo:

  # pkg upgrade -f libexo

  Users upgrading via ports should not be affected.

20201228:
  AFFECTS: www/py-flexget
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  py-flexget (or py37-flexget) has been renamed to flexget.
  "pkg upgrade" doesn't track MOVED file unlike portmaster, so
  provide a hint e.g.,

    $ pkg upgrade -x flexget

  or install again, letting pkg remove the old version

    $ pkg install flexget

20201218:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.15.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20201130:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/jpeg
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  The graphics/jpeg port has been removed in favor of graphics/jpeg-turbo.
  The former port was vulnerable and used an outdated ABI and API.

  Please check your make configuration for JPEG_PORT and remove it or
  set it to "jpeg-turbo" if it is currently set to "jpeg".

20201128:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/cego
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  Database updates from 2.45.x to 2.46.x require a xml tableset export
  and import, since table structure information has been changed.

20201128:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby26
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.6 to 2.7.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.6 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.6 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.6

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkg, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20201112:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/pushgateway
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@FreeBSD.org

  The v0.10.0 release changes the storage format. v0.10 can read the
  storage format of v0.5--v0.9. It will then persist the new format so
  that a downgrade won't be possible anymore [1].

  For later releases >= v1.0.0 only persistence files created by v0.10+
  are usable. So please, upgrade to v0.10 first to convert existing
  persistence files.

  It is intended to replace v0.10.0 in about four weeks from now (not
  before 2020-12-12) by >= v1.3.0.

20201110:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Changes related to the NetBox configuration:

  1. If in use, LDAP authentication must be enabled by setting
     REMOTE_AUTH_BACKEND to 'netbox.authentication.LDAPBackend'.  (The LDAP
     configuration parameters in ldap_config.py remain unchanged.)

  2. REMOTE_AUTH_DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS now takes a dictionary rather than a
     list.  This is a mapping of permission names to a dictionary of
     constraining attributes, or None.

     For example, ['dcim.add_site', 'dcim.change_site'] would become
     {'dcim.add_site': None, 'dcim.change_site': None}.

  3. Support for the DEFAULT_TIMEOUT parameter under REDIS database
     configuration was removed.  Set RQ_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT as a global
     configuration parameter instead.

  Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20201106:
  AFFECTS: users of www/samdruckerserver

20201030:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The security/openvpn port has been updated to v2.5.0, which brings a
  change to the default ciphersuite, which no longer contains BF-CBC.

  Some options have been removed. Also, if you need to support very old (v2.3)
  and unsupported clients or servers, you will need to adjust the
  configuration. For details, see:
  https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/release/2.5/Changes.rst#overview-of-changes-in-25

20201029:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v15.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node14, has been created for the
  v14.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v14.x can replace www/node
  with www/node14 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node14
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node14 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node14 www/node

20201026:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  emulators/qemu has been updated to 5.0.1. Previous 4.2.X branch has
  been repocopied to emulators/qemu42. If someone wants to stick with 4.2.X
  branch please use one of the following command:

  # pkg install emulators/qemu42
    or
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu42 emulators/qemu
    or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/qemu42 emulators/qemu

20201021:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-unit

  The www/py-unit port has been renamed to www/unit-python.

20201012:
  AFFECTS: Users of mesa-dri with VAAPI or VDPAU options
  AUTHOR: manu@FreeBSD.org

  The nondefault options VAAPI and VDPAU were removed from the mesa-dri
  port and two new ports, mesa-gallium-va and mesa-gallium-vdpau now contain
  the necessary libraries for using VAAPI or VDPAU on AMD hardware.

20201012:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libsoup-gnome
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  libsoup-gnome has been merged back into libsoup for people building locally:

20201006:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/tenshi
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for tenshi's configuration file has changed.  It was
  moved to /usr/local/etc/tenshi/tenshi.conf from /usr/local/etc/tenshi.conf
  in order to follow upstream defaults.

20201002:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail beginning with 6.4.12_1
  AUTHOR:  mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Note that if you are using fetchmail in a multi-user setup, i. e. with the
  fetchmail_users (mind the -s!) variable set, the $fetchmail_home_prefix +
  user second-guess work has been replaced by a real lookup of the user's home
  directory. In the majority of configurations, this should not make a
  difference, in some setups, it may open up some flexibility.

  The fetchmail_home_prefix variable is ignored from 6.4.12_1 onwards.

  Also, the rc script redirects its input from /dev/null so that passwords
  will not be interactively queried from an rcfile.  Put passwords into
  the [.]fetchmailrc or into a .netrc file.

20201002:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/modules
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

  The upstream developers of the Modules port encourage users to consult
  the MIGRATING document, which describes the major changes occurring between
  versions of Modules. It provides an overview of the new features and changed
  behaviors that will be encountered when upgrading:

  https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/v4.6.0/MIGRATING.html

20200930:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/syslog-ng32[789]
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  rc.conf variables syslog_ng_config and syslog_ng_pid have been replaced
  by syslog_ng_flags and syslog_ng_pidfile respectively, making them
  consistent with the rest of the ports tree. syslog_ng_config and
  syslog_ng_pid will continue to work until syslog-ng331 has been
  released and imported into ports.

20200924:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius3, who need python support
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  FreeRADIUS 3.x currently uses python 2.7 for rlm_python support, which has
  been deprecated and will be removed from the tree at the end of this year.

  Starting in 3.0.21_2, the PYTHON option has been converted to use python 3.x.

  Users should verify their python scripts are 3.x compatible and upgrade to
  3.0.21_2 (or higher) to bring in python 3.x support.

20200921:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: kbowling@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 11 to 12.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 11.9, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql11-server postgresql11-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql11-server-11.9.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql11-contrib-11.9.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib databases/postgresql11-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql12-server databases/postgresql12-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data12 -U postgres"
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /var/db/postgres/data11/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data12/ -U postgres "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres" in 11. The migration steps above now assume
     the "postgres" database user and FreeBSD user.
  2) See the updating entry 20190829 if you are updating from a release prior to 11.
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20200918:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/thunderbird
  AUTHOR: cmt@FreeBSD.org

  Thunderbird has been updated to the 78esr series. Thunderbird will
  try to convert old profiles on first start, but conversion may fail
  especially on old profiles. Also, older versions of Thunderbird will
  not be able to use a profile once it has been converted. It is
  strongly recommended to move any ~/.thunderbird folder away before
  starting Thunderbird 78 for the first time, thus creating a new and
  empty profile.
  Also note that OpenPGP functionality has been integrated into Thunderbird,
  obsoleting the Enigmail extension.
  Check https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP for details, and
  especially https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:OpenPGP:Smartcards
  if your private key lives on a smartcard.

20200914:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php72
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.2 to 7.4.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php72 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php74.

20200811:
  AFFECTS: users of *-emacs26-* packages
  AUTHOR: jrm@FreeBSD.org

  With the release of Emacs version 27.1, the major version of editors/emacs has
  changed from 26 to 27.  This means the names of some dependent packages have
  also changed, so simply running `pkg upgrade` will not upgrade foo-emacs26-x
  to foo-emacs27-x.  To update these packages, run these commands with superuser
  privileges.

  Binary package users:

    # sh
    # for i in $(pkg query -g %n '*-emacs26*'); do \
        nn=$(echo "$i" | sed -e 's/emacs26/emacs27/'); \
        pkg set -yn "$i":"$nn"; \
      done;
    # pkg upgrade

  portmaster users:

    # portmaster -r emacs

20200803:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.32.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20181213, it should still be the same.

  AUTHOR:  dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The %%WWWDIR%%%/logs directory has been relocated to /var/log/librenms/
  via the APP_LOG directive in %%WWWDIR%%%/.env.example - this won't affect
  existing installs, but you are strongly encouraged to update your .env file
  settings and relocate your logs.

  Logs which were going to /var/log/messages and /var/log/librenms/ now only go
  to /var/log/librenms/

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR:  dvl@FreeBSD.org

  As mentioned previously in 20200503 polling via cronjob has been removed as of
  release 1.63 - see
  https://community.librenms.org/t/dropping-support-for-php-7-1-and-python-2/11851

  A database upgrade is required:

     cd /usr/local/www/librenms
     sudo ./lnms migrate

  You must  migrate to the Dispatch Service:
  https://docs.librenms.org/Extensions/Dispatcher-Service/

  You may need to add LIBRENMS_USER to .env (see .env.example).

  These steps should get you running:
  * comment out the crontab entries listed above under PYPOLLER

  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash, shells/bash-static
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  In order to cleanly decouple bash from base, bash now reads `profile` from
  LOCALBASE/etc insead of from /etc. If you are using system wide bash
  configuration in /etc/profile please migrate to LOCALBASE/etc/profile

  # cp /etc/profile /usr/local/etc/profile

  or create a symlink

  # ln -s /etc/profile /usr/local/etc/

  If you encounter the following error, you may have the obsolete

  AFFECTS: users of mail/php7[2-4]-imap
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The imap module of PHP was compiled against cclient till now. But this lib is
  unmaintained for over 7 years. When combined with modern OpenSSL there are
  various crashes reported.

  Switching to the fork panda-cclient fixes these issues. Therefore we make the
  usage of Panda cclient the new default. If you want to use the old cclient,
  you need to enable it now!

  AFFECTS: users of www/baikal
  AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  The www/baikal has been updated to 0.7.1. With the 0.7.0 release, our
  configuration format was updated to use YAML files. You need to go through
  the installer again but we pre-fill most values with the ones from your old
  installation. We recommend that you make a full backup of your data, as a
  safety measure. Starting with 0.7.0, Baikal stores data in both the Specific
  and the config folders. Keep this in mind when upgrading!

  Known issue:: Upgrading from versions older than 0.6.1 does not work.

20200531:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-policyd-spf-python
  AUTHOR:  yasu@utahime.org

  This port is now deprecated because upstream project is superseded by its
  successor. So uninstall this port and install mail/py-spf-engine instead.
  Keep in mind that the path of configuration file is changed from
  ${PREFIX}/etc/postfix-policyd-spf-python/policyd-spf.conf to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/python-policyd-spf/policyd-spf.conf. So you need to move
  it to new location unless you use the default one without changing.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb104-client, databases/mariadb104-server
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The ports now add sample configuration files to /usr/local/etc/mysql. You
  must merge your client configuration with the conf.d/client.cnf and your
  server configuration with conf.d/server.cnf.

20200518:
  AFFECTS: users of converters/libiconv
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  Support for the Japanese specific patches have been discontinued.
  These were previously added in a nondefault ports options, for people who

  The home directory of sddm user has been moved to /var/lib/sddm. It is advised
  to run following commands as root after updating the package:

    # pw usermod -n sddm -d /var/lib/sddm
    # pwd_mkdb /etc/master.passwd
    # mv /usr/local/etc/sddm/home/state.conf /var/lib/sddm/state.conf
    # rm -rf /usr/local/etc/sddm/home

  Otherwise, SDDM will keep using /usr/local/etc/sddm/home/ as its HOME.

20200515:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libphutil, devel/arcanist-lib, devel/phabricator
  AUTHOR: grembo@FreeBSD.org

  Upstream fully deprecated devel/libphutil and merged its functionality
  into devel/arcanist-lib and devel/phabricator. As a result, the
  devel/libphutil port will be removed from the ports tree.

  After upgrading devel/(arcanist-lib|phabricator) to version 20200514, it is
  recommended to remove the orphaned libphutil package by running:

    # pkg delete php\*-libphutil

  Alternatively, 'pkg autoremove' will also work as expected, but might
  remove orphaned packages unrelated to this update.

  net/irrd has been upgraded to 4.X branch. If someone wants to stick with
  legacy version then pkg users have to do something like

  # pkg set -o net/irrd:net/irrd-legacy

  For portmaster users
  # portmaster -o net/irrd-legacy net/irrd

  following command:

  	find /usr/local/share/fonts -type f -name .uuid -delete

20200326:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/sonarqube and devel/sonar-ant-task
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The outdated port devel/sonarqube has moved to
  devel/sonarqube-community to make it clear that it is the community
  edition. The log and DB files are still stored in the same location.

  The devel/sonar-ant-task port has moved to devel/sonarqube-ant-task
  to match the upstream-name. The install location is renamed
  accordingly.

  At the same time the user/group of the sonarqube port changed from
  www:www to sonarqube:sonarqube.

  It is expected that nobody was using the 6.2 version from 2016
  anymore and no change needs to be done. No analysis was done to check
  if the old 6.2 version can be updated in-place to the 8.2 version.
  As such if there is still someone using the old 6.2 version, you may
  have to delete /var/log/sonarqube and /var/db/sonarqube before
  installing the new version.

20200320
  AFFECTS: users of devel/qca
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  New versions of devel/qca stopped supporting OpenSSL < 1.1.
  For this reason devel/qca-legacy has been added, which is
  held back at an older version until FreeBSD 11 goes EOL.

  Ports depending on devel/qca should stop adding direct LIB_DEPENDS
  and switch to depending on it via USES=qca.

  FreeBSD 11 users might want to run something like

      pkg set -o devel/qca:devel/qca-legacy

20200320:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/libxkbcommon
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The libxkbcommon library (x11/libxkbcommon), used to handle keyboards
  in some applications, most notably kde and wayland, have been switched
  to use evdev rules by default on FreeBSD 12 and later.  Some keys, most
  notably arrow keys, may not work in applications using libxkbcommon if
  you are using xf86-input-keyboard rather than xf86-input-libinput.
  If you have trouble with the keyboard keys, and if /var/log/Xorg.*.log
  shows that the "kbd" or "keyboard" driver is being used, you need to
  switch to legacy rules by setting the environment variable
  XKB_DEFAULT_RULES to xorg.
  This switch is made to match the default configuration on FreeBSD 12.1 and
  later, the default configuration on FreeBSD 11.3 still uses the legacy
  rules.

20200316:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/slack-term
  AUTHOR: dmgk@FreeBSD.org

  The config file location was changed from ~/.slack-term to
  ~/.config/slack-term/config, please move your existing config file
  accordingly.

20200308
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/mesa-libs and legacy graphics drivers
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The mesa OpenGL library (graphics/mesa-libs) has been switched to use DRI3
  by default, instead of the older DRI2 interface.  This might cause regressions
  when using the legacy graphics drivers, either through
  graphics/drm-legacy-kmod or the graphics drivers in base.

  If you experience issues when running OpenGL applications it is possible
  to force the use of DRI2 by setting the LIBGL_DRI3_DISABLE environment
  variable to 1 before starting any OpenGL application.  The easiest way to
  do this is by adding it to either your shell startup files or .xinitrc.

20200306
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql80-server
  AUTHOR: joneum@FreeBSD.org

  As of MySQL 8.0.16, the MySQL server performs the upgrade tasks previously
  handled by mysql_upgrade. Consequently, mysql_upgrade is unneeded and is
  deprecated as of that version, and will be removed in a future MySQL version.
  Because mysql_upgrade no longer performs upgrade tasks,
  it exits with status 0 unconditionally.

20200303:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/librenms
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  1. Apache / mod_php options removed

  The APACHEMOD option has been removed. LibreNMS can be used
  with other webservers, not just Apache. In order to simplify
  the port, the option was removed.

  Now you manually install the webserver of your preference.

  If upgrading from LibreNMS < 1.61, you can do this to
  prevent 'pkg autoremove' from uninstalling Apache / mod_php:

  $ sudo pkg set -A 0 apache24 mod_php74
  Mark apache24-2.4.41 as not automatically installed? [y/N]: y
  Mark mod_php74-7.4.3 as not automatically installed? [y/N]: y

  Adjust mod_php74 to suit the version of mod_php you have.

  2. include/defaults.inc.php is gone

  The file include/defaults.inc.php is no longer distributed by
  the upstream project. The FreeBSD port patched this file to
  correct the paths to common tools such as ping, snmpwalk, etc.

  These values previously adjusted by the port must now be specified
  in config.php. New installs will have this automatically, but existing
  installs must be updated manually. These are the entries you should
  add if upgrading from LibreNMS < 1.61:

  $config['snmpwalk']       = '/usr/local/bin/snmpwalk';
  $config['snmpget']        = '/usr/local/bin/snmpget';
  $config['snmpbulkwalk']   = '/usr/local/bin/snmpbulkwalk';
  $config['snmptranslate']  = '/usr/local/bin/snmptranslate';

  $config['ping']           = '/sbin/ping';
  $config['mtr']            = '/usr/local/bin/mtr';
  $config['nmap']           = '/usr/local/bin/nmap';

  $config['nagios_plugins'] = '/usr/local/libexec/nagios';
  $config['ipmitool']       = '/usr/local/bin/ipmitool';
  $config['virsh']          = '/usr/local/bin/virsh';
  $config['dot']            = '/usr/local/bin/dot';
  $config['sfdp']           = '/usr/local/bin/sfdp';
  $config['nfdump']         = '/usr/local/bin/nfdump';

20200229:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/apache-solr
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Apache-solr switched to the supported java LTS version 11.
  Make sure you update the following files accordingly:
  /usr/local/etc/solr.in.sh (see /usr/local/etc/solr.in.sh.sample)
  /usr/local/etc/javavm_opts.conf (JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/openjdk11/)

20200225:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  1. Removal of the Topology Maps feature

  The deprecated topology maps feature has been removed.  Please replicate
  any required data to another source before upgrading NetBox to v2.7.7, as
  any existing topology maps will be deleted.


  2. Changed REDIS database configuration settings

  The REDIS database configuration parameters were splitted up in two
  discrete subsections named "webhooks" and "caching" with the 2.7 release.
  This requires modification of the REDIS parameter in configuration.py as
  follows:

  Old Redis sample configuration:

  REDIS = {
    'HOST': 'localhost',
    'PORT': 6379,
    'PASSWORD': '',
    'DATABASE': 0,
    'CACHE_DATABASE': 1,
    'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
    'SSL': False,
  }

  New Redis sample configuration:

  REDIS = {
    'webhooks': {
        'HOST': 'redis.example.com',
        'PORT': 1234,
        'PASSWORD': 'foobar',
        'DATABASE': 0,
        'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
        'SSL': False,
    },
    'caching': {
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': 6379,
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'DATABASE': 1,
        'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
        'SSL': False,
    }
  }

  Note that the CACHE_DATABASE parameter has been removed and the connection
  settings have been duplicated for both webhooks and caching.  This allows
  one to make use of separate Redis instances if desired.  It is fine to use
  the same Redis service for both functions, although the database
  identifiers should be different.

  Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20200223:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gsasl
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The library part of security/gsasl has been split into security/libgsasl.
  The security/gsasl now depends on security/libgsasl. Due to this change,
  old security/gsasl conflicts with the new security/libgsasl and it can
  prevent the installed security/gsasl from upgrading. Please remove the
  installed security/gsasl before upgrading if a conflict error occurs.

20200220:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  x11-servers/xorg-server has been updated to 1.20.7.

  With this update, xorg-server has switched from using the devd backend to
  the udev backend for device configuration on FreeBSD 12 and 13.  If you have
  issues with input devices, please see the install message for details.

  The HAL backend option has been completely removed, as it was deprecated.

  If you have problems with input devices, ensure that both x11/libinput and
  x11-drivers/xf86-input-libinput are installed.  They are installed in the
  default configuration, but if you have a custom configuration, they might not
  be.

20200210:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/prosody
  AUTHOR: thomas@beingboiled.info

  Prosody's pid file and data directory have moved to a new location.
  If you are upgrading from a version with the pid file and data
  directory in /usr/local/var/lib/prosody please perform these steps:

    # stop Prosody
    pkill -F /usr/local/var/lib/prosody/prosody.pid

    # copy the data directory
    cp -a /usr/local/var/lib/prosody /var/db/
    rm -f /var/db/prosody/prosody.pid

  Make sure your prosody config has the following option set:

    pidfile = "/var/run/prosody/prosody.pid"

  Then start Prosody again. Everything should be working as before and
  the /usr/local/var/lib/prosody directory can now be removed.

20200207:
  AFFECTS: users of security/nss
  AUTHOR: lwhsu@FreeBSD.org

  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The PYTHON2 and PYTHON3 options have been turned into a single PYTHON
  option that uses whichever python you've set as default. However,
  this means that you cannot have both python2 and python3 support at
  the same time.

20200126:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/gstreamer1-plugins[-bad]
  AUTHOR: kwm@freebsd.org

  In GStreamer 1.16 some files moved from the gstreamer1-plugins-bad package

  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  In the entry 20191216 for the Python update the filtering constrains
  are too limiting and omit the Samba supplimentary libraries, which do
  have Python bindings to the default Python 3.x version. With the update
  of the default Python3 version you also need to rebuild all the
  supplementary Samba libraries and samba410 itself.

  For portmaster users it would be enough to run:

  AFFECTS: users of python
  AUTHOR: antoine@FreeBSD.org

  Default version of python3 and python was switched to 3.7.

  For ports users wanting to keep version 3.6 as default,
  add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= python=3.6 python3=3.6 to make.conf

  This may ease the upgrade for users of pre-build packages:
  # sh
  # for i in $(pkg query -g %n 'py36-*'); do pkg set -yn ${i}:py37-${i#py36-}; done
  # pkg upgrade

  For portmaster users:
  # sh
  # portmaster -o lang/python37 python36
  # REINSTALL="$(pkg info -o py36-\* | awk '{printf "%s ", $2}')"
  # pkg delete -f py36-\*
  # portmaster $REINSTALL
  # REBUILD=$(pkg query -g "%n:%dn" '*' | grep py3 | grep -v py37 | cut -d : -f 1 | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD
  # REBUILD2=$(pkg list | grep python-36 | xargs pkg which | awk '{print $6}' | sort -u)
  # portmaster $REBUILD2

  AFFECTS: users of mail/nextcloud-mail
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  Version 0.20.0 removed the default mail configuration via config.php.
  All users will be prompted to enter account and SMTP- and IMAP-server
  details for sending and reading email.

20191126:
  AFFECTS: consumers of net/py-urllib3
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Since version 1.25 HTTPS connections are now verified by default which is
  done via "cert_reqs = 'CERT_REQUIRED'".  While certificate verification
  can be disabled via "cert_reqs = 'CERT_NONE'", it's highly recommended to
  leave it on.

  Various consumers of net/py-urllib3 already have implemented routines that
  either explicitly enable or disable HTTPS certificate verification (e.g.
  via configuration settings, CLI arguments, etc.).

  Yet it may happen that there are still some consumers which don't
  explicitly enable/disable certificate verification for HTTPS connections
  which could then lead to errors (as is often the case with self-signed
  certificates).

  In case of an error one should try first to temporarily disable
  certificate verification of the problematic urllib3 consumer to see if
  this approach will remedy the issue.

  AFFECTS: users of irc/eggdrop
  AUTHOR: dbaio@FreeBSD.org

  The irc/eggdrop port has been updated to 1.8.4 and its config is not
  backward compatible with 1.6.21. A new port was created to keep 1.6.21
  version available at irc/eggdrop16 and it will be available for 3 months
  until users have time to upgrade their configuration.

  More information at:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eggheads/eggdrop/v1.8.4/NEWS

  # portupgrade -o databases/redis4 databases/redis

20191103:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v13.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node12, has been created for the
  v12.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v12.x can replace www/node
  with www/node12 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node12
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node12 www/node

20191029:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/open-vm-tools[-nox11]
  AUTHOR: jpaetzel@FreeBSD.org

open-vm-tools 11.0.1 has removed the vmxnet driver.  This driver has been
in tree for quite some time and hopefully everyone is using the in tree
version, however if you had removed device vmx from your kernel, or are
running an unsupported version of FreeBSD which didn't have the driver
included in the base system, updating your open-vm-tools version will
leave you without networking.

20191026:
  AFFECTS: users of www/qt5-webengine
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Users that upgrade www/qt5-webengine without using pkg/poudriere might
  experience failures due to conflicts with the installed version of 5.12.2.

  In that case, pkg delete -f the qt5-webengine package before building
  the updated version.

20191025:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver (and slave ports)
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  x11/nvidia-driver* ports no longer install Linux programs and libraries,
  which had been moved to their own ports (x11/linux-nvidia-libs*).  When
  updating the driver package next time, remember to install them manually
  if you need to run Linux OpenGL programs.

20191016:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE Plasma Desktop (x11/plasma5*)
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  With Plasma 5.17 the startup script has been renamed. People who use the
  .xinitrc method to start Plasma have to call the new binary.

  Previously:
  	exec ck-launch-session startkde
  Change to:
  	exec ck-launch-session startplasma-x11

20191014:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/rspamd, mail/rspamd-devel
  AUTHOR: vsevolod@FreeBSD.org

  Sample configuration files has been removed as default configuration files
  are NOT intended for modification by users and SHOULD be overwritten on
  port upgrade.

  Make sure the default configuration files are unmodified and migrate all
  configuration changes to the proper places, before you continue.

20191002:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/groff
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  with groff 1.2.4_3, groff does not depend anymore on ghostscript and
  netpbm. In order to be able to properly use the html backend the user
  can install ghostscript and netpbm from ports without the need of
  reinstalling the package.

  Also note that the X11 option has been removed.

20190930:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/netbox
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  Since the 2.6 release a running Redis server instance is required for
  caching objects to run.  Also the following settings like below need to be
  added (or modified) in the existing configuration.py:

  REDIS = {
    'HOST': 'localhost',
    'PORT': 6397,
    'PASSWORD': ''
    'DATABASE': 0,
    'CACHE_DATABASE': 1,
    'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
    'SSL': False,
  }

  Note that if you were using these settings in a prior release with
  webhooks, the DATABASE setting remains the same but an additional
  CACHE_DATABASE settings has been added with a default value of 1 to
  support the caching backend.

  The DATABASE setting will be renamed in a future release of NetBox to
  better relay the meaning of the setting.  It is highly recommended to keep
  the webhook and cache databases separate.  Using the same database number
  for both may result in webhook processing data being lost during cache
  flushing events.

  Please also check the pkg-message and the changelogs for further info.

20190927:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-devel
  AUTHOR: bofh@FreeBSD.org

  qemu-devel has been updated to 4.1.0 and 4.0.0 has been merged into a new port
  emulators/qemu40. If you want to stick with 4.0.X branch, simply use:
  # portmaster -o emulators/qemu-devel emulators/qemu40

20190927:
  AFFECTS: users of XFCE desktop (x11-wm/xfce4)
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Due to changes in the XFCE 4.14 metaport, systems could end up with
  both xscreensaver and xfce4-screensaver installed and enabled
  simultaneously.

  This can cause conflicts and problems unlocking the screen.

  To avoid problems, please make sure to have only one enabled by
  going to the Application Autostart tab of the Session and Startup
  settings applet and enable only one Screensaver there.

  Some further information can be found in the xfce4-session
  pkg-message displayed on installation and upgrade.

20190920:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/pushgateway
  AUTHOR: 0mp@FreeBSD.org

20190909:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby25
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.5 to 2.6.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.5 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.5 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.5

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you do not use pkg, please check entry 20190420.
  The description there should also work for this version.

20190906:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-fabric
  AUTHOR: dbaio@FreeBSD.org

  Fabric (devel/py-fabric) was upgraded to 2.5.0, Fabric (2+) represents
  a near-total reimplementation and reorganization of the software.

  Fabric 2 is not at 100% feature parity with 1.x! Some features have been
  explicitly dropped, but others simply have not been ported over yet,
  either due to time constraints or because said features need to be
  re-examined in a modern context.

  More information at:
  https://www.fabfile.org/upgrading.html#upgrading

    pkg set -o devel/py-fabric:devel/py-fabric1

20190830:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  Make sure you upgrade your PostgreSQL to version 11 as described in 20190829,
  before you upgrade your gitlab-ce version.
  Gitlab-ce 12.1 needs at least PostgreSQL version 9.6.

  After this you can follow the usual upgrade guide:
  https://gitlab.fechner.net/mfechner/Gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/12.0-12.1-freebsd.md

20190829:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql* and other software using PostgreSQL to run
  AUTHOR: tz@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PostgreSQL has been switched from 9.5 to 11.
  The upgrade procedure can use up twice the space the databases
  currently needs. If you have a big amount of stored data take a
  closer look at the manpage of pg_upgrade for avoidance and/or
  speedup of the upgrade.

  The upgrade instructions consider a basic usage and do not match
  complex scenarios like replication, sharding, or similar.

  Upgrade instructions:

  First stop your PostgreSQL, create PostgreSQL-binaries and backup your data.
  If you have another Version of PostgreSQL installed, for example 9.5.19, your
  files are named according to this.

  # service postgresql stop
  # pkg create postgresql95-server postgresql95-contrib
  # mkdir /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql95-server-9.5.19.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # tar xf postgresql95-contrib-9.5.19.txz -C /tmp/pg-upgrade
  # pkg delete -f databases/postgresql95-server databases/postgresql95-contrib databases/postgresql95-client

  Now update PostgreSQL:

    pkg user:
    # pkg install databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # pkg upgrade

    Portmaster users:
    # portmaster databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # portmaster -a

    Portupgrade users:
    # portinstall databases/postgresql11-server databases/postgresql11-contrib
    # portupgrade -a

  After installing the new PostgreSQL version you need to convert
  all your databases to new version:

  # su -l postgres -c "/usr/local/bin/initdb --encoding=utf-8 --lc-collate=C -D /var/db/postgres/data11 -U pgsql"
  # chown -R postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data/
  # su -l postgres -c "pg_upgrade -b /tmp/pg-upgrade/usr/local/bin/ -d /usr/local/pgsql/data/ -B /usr/local/bin/ -D /var/db/postgres/data11/ -U pgsql "

  Now the migration is finished. You can start PostgreSQL again with:

  # service postgresql start

  ATTENTION:
  1) The default user changed from "pgsql" to "postgres". The migration steps above preserve
     the "pgsql" database user while the database daemon is now executed as the "postgres" FreeBSD user.
  2) The default data dir changed from "/usr/local/pgsql/data/" to "/var/db/postgres/data11/"
  3) If you use non-default initdb options, you have to adjust the initdb-command accordingly

20190816:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  Riak support has been removed by upstream. For update instructions from
  19.05, please refer to:

20190812:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.30.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, follow the
  instructions in entry 20181213, it should still be the same.

20190801:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ot-recorder
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  The data directory has moved from /var/spool/owntracks to
  /var/db/owntracks

  Be sure to stop otrecorder, move the directory, and start otrecorder.

  service ot-recorder stop
  cd /var/spool
  mv owntracks /var/db
  service ot-recorder start

20190728:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  AUTHOR: kai@FreeBSD.org

  The support for Python 2.7 has been dropped with the 1.1.0 release of
  net/py-matrix-synapse.

  Users that still use the Python 2.7 version of net-im/py-matrix-synapse
  should switch to a newer Python version, e.g. 3.6, which is the default
  Python version since April 2019.

20190717:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/zetacoin and net-p2p/zetacoin-nox11
  AUTHOR: daniel@morante.net

  Zetacoin will default to using modern versions of BDB (5.x or 6.x) when
  the WALLET option is selected.   See pkg-help for explanation.

  The zetacoin-nox11 slave port was renamed to zetacoin-daemon to align
  with the net-p2p/bitcoin format.

  The zetacoin-cli and zetacoin-tx utilities have been re-packaged into
  a separate port. If you require these programs, or use the zetacoin-cli
  program to access the daemon or the GUI, install net-p2p/zetacoin-utils
  to reinstall them.

20190717:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/py-borgmatic
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  The default location for borgmatic's configurations changed. We moved it
  from '/etc/borgmatic' to '/usr/local/etc/borgmatic' in order to follow
  recommended standards used on FreeBSD.

20190710:
  AFFECTS: users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 or c6_64 in /etc/make.conf
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  On amd64 adding DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 to /etc/make.conf made Linux
  infrastructure ports (linux_base-c6 and linux-c6*) install i386 CentOS 6
  packages.  Using c6_64 instead of c6 made them install mixed amd64/i386
  CentOS 6 packages and allowed Linux application ports to install amd64
  binaries when available.  The i386-only configuration was only useful for
  users of x11/nvidia-driver* which didn't provide Linux amd64 emulation
  until recently.

  With x11/nvidia-driver* now supporting Linux amd64 there's no longer a
  need for i386-only Linux on amd64 so DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 has been
  changed to make Linux infrastructure ports install mixed amd64/i386
  CentOS 6 packages, like c6_64 before, and support for c6_64 has been
  removed.

  Users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6 should reinstall linux_base-c6 and
  all packages that depend on it.  A list of dependent packages can be
  obtained with the following command:

    pkg info -r linux_base-c6

  Users with DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=linux=c6_64 only need to replace c6_64 with
  c6 in /etc/make.conf.

  Users of x11/nvidia-driver* should upgrade to FreeBSD 11.3 or 12.0 if
  they want to run Linux amd64 OpenGL programs.  If you are running an
  older version you may want to postpone installing or updating Linux
  application ports until you find the time to upgrade because application
  ports may install amd64 binaries now.  Infrastructure ports are safe to
  reinstall, and so is x11/nvidia-driver*.

  On i386 nothing has changed.

  The default MySQL version has been updated from 5.6 to 5.7.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 5.6 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep MySQL 5.6 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=mysql=5.6

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  running server instance. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  on installed packages.

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba410
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  If you used Samba in AD/DC mode with the previous versions of the port on UFS2
  backed storage you have to add usage of vfs_freebsd VFS module for at least
  SYSVOL share and configure it to use 'legacy' mode(see manpage).

  The reason behind this is that previous versions Samba port used a hack to
  workaround broken mapping of Linux security and trusted extended attributes
  into FreeBSD namespace. In particular, essential security.NTACL attribute
  was replaced with the user.NTACL and placed in a insecure USER namespace.

  This port dropped this hack in favor of vfs_freebsd module, which should
  provide more controlled way of such a mapping.

  To maintain the compatibility with the previous installations on UFS2 storage
  (as ZFS uses it's own way of mapping SYSVOL, thanks to the iXsystems patches)
  the vfs_freebsd module provides 'legacy' mode that implements old functionality.

  For the fresh installations it is recommended to use 'secure' mode of operations
  for this module and use it as a global vfs objects.

  Caution: The given module is still considered EXPERIMENTAL.

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba410, net/samba4[6-8] and devel/talloc?, devel/tevent?, databases/tdb?, databases/ldb*
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  The port of the new version of Samba 4.10 is introduced. Due necessarily
  to keep backwards compatibility for the legacy samba4[6-8] ports the
  upgrade procedure is a bit convoluted.

  You are safe to perform fresh new install of samba410 port. In case you
  are upgrading from the previous versions of Samba, please use the
  following procedure:

  0.  Take backups of all the relevant files, in particular PREFIX/etc/smb4.conf
      and /var/db/samba4/ subdirectory. Keep in mind that files there (may)
      have extended attributes, so use appropriate tools to preserve them.

  1a. If you haven't updated Samba between 20190619 and 20190630 then next
      step should be as simple as:

        portmaster -o net/samba410 net/samba48

  1b. If you have been affected by the archiving legacy versions of
      Samba-related libraries for legacy versions of Samba, which happened
      in the given time frame, then you need to reverse operation from the
       20190619 entry:

      for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc devel/talloc1
        portmaster -o devel/tevent devel/tevent1
        portmaster -o databases/tdb databases/tdb1
        portmaster -o net/samba410 net/samba48

      for users of portupgrade:
        portupgrade -o devel/talloc devel/talloc1
        portupgrade -o devel/tevent devel/tevent1
        portupgrade -o databases/tdb databases/tdb1

  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  To introduce samba410(we deliberately skip samba49 due the complexity of handling)
  and to drop dependency on deprecated Python 2.7, Samba supplementary libraries
  talloc, tevent and tdb were split into current Python 3 compatible versions
  and legacy ones, with the suffix "1".

  Old versions of Samba were changed to depend on the legacy supplementary libraries,
  so if you need to install samba46, samba47 or samba48 over previous Samba
  installations you need to downgrade supplementary libs with the following commands:

  for users of portmaster:
        portmaster -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portmaster -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portmaster -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb
        portmaster -r talloc1

  for users of portupgrade:
        portupgrade -o devel/talloc1 devel/talloc
        portupgrade -o devel/tevent1 devel/tevent
        portupgrade -o databases/tdb1 databases/tdb

  Release 0.4.0 fundamentally changes the command line options for
  running the server and introduces a new way to initialize the local RPKI
  repository used by Routinator.
  If you have been using previous releases, you will likely have to adjust

  Gitea requires the addition of another secret to the config file in order
  to start up.  Either manually add JWT_SECRET to the
  ${PREFIX}/etc/gitea/conf/app.ini config file (see app.ini.sample), or allow
  Gitea to make the change for you by making the config file writable to the
  git user.

  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v12.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. This is a major release, including many significant
  changes. Users are encouraged to read the release announcements before
  upgrading:

  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.0.0/

20190423:
  AFFECTS: users of www/gitlab-ce
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The directory where all repositories and ssh permissions are stored
  was changed from /usr/home/git back to /usr/local/git, to match again the
  recommended standards on FreeBSD.
  This will cause now some other git management packages to collide with
  gitlab. Make sure you migrate all you git repositories to gitlab first,
  before you continue.

  Make sure /usr/local/git/repositories and /usr/local/git/.ssh are not
  existing!
  Otherwise the next commands can break your installation for managing
  git repositories within gitlab and with your other gitlab management
  software!

  You must move the old files to the new location with:
  # service gitlab stop
  # mv /usr/home/git /usr/local/
  # pkg upg

  Make sure you update your config files, diff shows you what you maybe
  must change:
  # cd /usr/local/www/gitlab-ce
  # git diff config/gitlab.yml.sample config/gitlab.yml
  # cd /usr/local/share/gitlab-shell/
  # git diff config.yml.sample config.yml
  # cd /usr/local/share/gitaly
  # git diff config.toml.sample config.toml

  # Change home directory of user git back to /usr/local/git
  # vipw
  The line should now looks like:
  git:*:211:211::0:0:gitosis user:/usr/local/git:/bin/sh

  If you do an upgrade of gitlab follow the upgrade guide.
  If not, just start gitlab again with:
  # service gitlab start

  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.9 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20190421:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/cego
  AUTHOR: pi@FreeBSD.org

  To upgrade from cego 2.39.16 to 2.44.1, you need to export to xml before
  the upgrade and import from xml after the upgrade, because the internal
  storage has changed for some types.

  Use these steps:

  - export your database while it runs, see
    http://www.lemke-it.com/litexec?request=pubcegodoc&user=&lang=en&section=cgdoc_database_running.html#tsimpexp_mode
    for details.
  - stop the database
    service cego stop
  - upgrade the port/package
  - re-create the database
    cego --mode=create --tableset=<database> --dbxml=<database>.xml
  - import the database
    cego --mode=xmlimport --tableset=<database> \
	--dbxml=<database>.xml --impfile=export.xml --doLogging
  - modify /etc/rc.conf by adding
    cego_<database>_cpdump="YES"
    cego_<database>_cleanup="YES"
  - start the database
    service cego start

20190420:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby24
  AUTHOR: mfechner@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 2.4 to 2.5.

  If you compile your own ports you may keep 2.4 as the default version by
  adding the following lines to your /etc/make.conf file:

  #
  # Keep ruby 2.4 as default version
  #
  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=ruby=2.4

  If you wish to update to the new default version, you need to first stop any
  software that uses ruby. Then, you will need to follow these steps, depending
  upon how you manage your system.

  If you use pkgng, simply upgrade:
  # pkg upgrade

  If you use portmaster, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby25 lang/ruby24
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-2.5

  If you use portupgrade, install new ruby, then rebuild all ports that depend
  on ruby:

  # pkg delete -f ruby portupgrade
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portupgrade install clean
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby24:lang/ruby25
  # portupgrade -x ruby-2.5.\* -fr lang/ruby25

  These ports' bridge, client, server daemon unintendedly had spit out
  chain_certs (certificate chain) directory on libexec directory until
  r494024.

  If your ${PREFIX}/libexec/softether/chain_certs directory is empty, you
  can remove the directory safely. If the directory is not empty, move it
  to ${SE_DBDIR} when upgrading softether. Following commands should help:

      service softether_(bridge|client|server) stop
      (portmaster, portupgrade or pkg upgrade)
      mv ${PREFIX}/libexec/softether/chain_certs ${SE_DBDIR}/

  which results in invalid XML, and causing XMPP clients to disconnect.  For more
  details, please refer to: https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/2744

  This upgrade contains the patch that fixes the problem going forward. For fixing already
  affected users, you'll need to wipe off the MAM cache for the affected users:

      sudo -u ejabberd -H ejabberdctl remove_mam_for_user <user> <server>

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/mk-livestatus
  AUTHOR: egypcio@FreeBSD.org

  The default Nagios version supported by net-mgmt/mk-livestatus changed
  from Nagios 3 to Nagios 4 - the respective Nagios package was added to
  net-mgmt/mk-livestatus' runtime dependencies.

  If you still need support for Nagios 3 you just need to change the
  options for net-mgmt/mk-livestatus and compile the port yourself.

20190202:
  AFFECTS: users of archivers/urbackup-server
  AUTHOR: freebsd@coombscloud.com

  Some of the port's sources previously included absolute references to /etc/urbackup.
  The upgrade now changes these references to ${PREFIX}/etc/urbackup.  If you have
  placed any configuration files within /etc/urbackup, these should be relocated to
  ${PREFIX}/etc/urbackup.

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/rubygem-fluentd, sysutils/fluent-bit
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The fluentd port has been upgraded from the 0.12 line to 1.3.3.  The upgrade
  is mostly non-disruptive since there is a backward compatibility with 0.12
  plugins and configuration files, but care should be taken about the order of
  server upgrades since fluentd 1.x is unable to send it's data to version 0.12
  instances.  You should carefully read

  The fetchmail port no longer offers the X11 option and no longer
  depends on Python.  The corresponding fetchmailconf Python program has now
  been split out into a separate port or package, so that fetchmail itself
  will no longer require Python.

  Users who wish to use fetchmailconf should install the new fetchmailconf
  port or package.

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/qgis
  AUTHOR: rhurlin@gwdg.de

  GIS 3.4 LTR, the first long-term release (LTR) of QGIS 3, has landed
  in the FreeBSD ports tree. It will also replace the previous 2.18 LTR
  in the QGIS package repositories in February 2019 [1].

  Beside, the latest Qt4 version 4.8.7 has been EOL since December 2015
  and its expiration date on FreeBSD is set to March, 15th 2019.
  Because QGIS 2 is based on Qt4 and Python2, it was decided to not create
  a legacy port for QGIS 2, after graphics/qgis changed to QGIS 3.

  For users moving over from the 2.18 LTR there is a huge list of new
  features and impactful changes in this new 3.4 LTR version. Most notably
  3.x plugins are incompatible with 2.x plugins, so please review your
  plugin usage carefully. Before moving over, if you have not already
  done so, take a look at the changelogs from versions 3.0, 3.2, and
  3.4 [2][3][4] to understand the full scope of changes in the 3.x release.

  AFFECTS: users of net/GeoIP
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  Maxmind no longer provides geolocation data in the legacy format used
  by net/GeoIP. All GEOIP-related OPTIONS have been removed, and all
  GeoIP-dependent ports will be removed soon.

  Where possible, you must switch to net/libmaxminddb, which uses the
  newer (and fully supported) GeoIP 2 format. Unfortunately, this is
  not a drop-in replacement. To fetch the GeoIP 2 geolocation databases,
  whether the free or paid versions, you must use net/geoipupdate
  (pkg install geoipupdate).

  The legacy database is no longer available, and we cannot distribute
  it by the Maxmind license, so the legacy GeoIP format is essentially
  dead.

20190108:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql-connector-java
  AUTHOR: matthew@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/mysql-connector-java port has been updated to 8.0.13,
  which requires a minimum of Java 1.8, so dropping support for Java
  1.6 and 1.7.  Users of those versions of Java should substitute the
  databases/mysql-connector-java51 port which remains at version
  5.1.47

20190103:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/vlc*
  AUTHOR: riggs@FreeBSD.org

  The multimedia/vlc port has been upgraded to 3.0.5, the latest upstream
  release. Subsequently, multimedia/vlc-qt4 and multimedia/vlc3 have been
  retired and removed from the ports tree. Users who previously used
  multimedia/vlc3 might want to switch to multimedia/vlc with the following
  commands:

  # pkg install multimedia/vlc
    or
  # portmaster -o multimedia/vlc multimedia/vlc3

  AFFECTS: users of devel/trio
  AUTHOR: rodrigo@freebsd.org

  Since trio 1.16-1, the shared lib previously misnamed libtrio.so.2.0.0
  is now named libtrio.so.2 and the symlink libtrio.so is created.

20181222:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ntopng
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Since ntopng 3.7, for security reasons, the default setting for
  the data directory has been changed to "/var/db/ntopng", and the
  default user has been changed to "ntopng". This new directory is
  created automatically by the port/package with correct permissions.

  In order to maintain backward compatibility, if you are already
  using "/var/tmp/ntopng" as data directory, ntopng keeps using that
  folder, owned by "nobody". This said, using the old defaults is not
  recommended and a manual action is required in order to migrate to
  the new settings, unless you are already using a custom directory:

  # service ntopng stop
  # mv /var/tmp/ntopng/* /var/db/ntopng/
  # chown -R ntopng:ntopng /var/db/ntopng
  # service ntopng start

  Please check the upstream FAQ for reference:

  The default Perl version has been switched to Perl 5.28.  If you are using
  binary packages to upgrade your system, you do not have anything to do, pkg
  upgrade will do the right thing.  For the other people, assuming you are
  migrating from 5.26 to 5.28, do:

  First, add to /etc/make.conf:

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=  perl5=5.28

  Portupgrade users:
	portupgrade -o lang/perl5.28 -f lang/perl5.26

	  You can now remove the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line added earlier
	  from /etc/make.conf

	  Then you will need to rebuild everything that uses libperl.so, you
	  can do so with:

	portupgrade -f `pkg shlib -qR libperl.so.5.26`

	  If, for some reason, this command fails at one point, it is safe to
	  run it again, it will not rebuild what it already rebuilt, as the
	  ports that have been rebuilt no longer depend on libperl.so.5.26 but
	  on libperl.so.5.28.

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.28 lang/perl5.26

	  You can now remove the DEFAULT_VERSIONS line added earlier
	  from /etc/make.conf

	  Then you will need to rebuild everything that uses libperl.so, you
	  can do so with:

	portmaster `pkg shlib -qR libperl.so.5.26`

	  If, for some reason, this command fails at one point, it is safe to
	  run it again, it will not rebuild what it already rebuilt, as the
	  ports that have been rebuilt no longer depend on libperl.so.5.26 but

  If you want to stay with the gtk2 version you need to use "pkg install"
  to install the new gtk2 flavor, pkg will automatically deinstall the
  gtk3 flavors.

  If using port, to maintain the gtk2 version, you will need to deinstall
  geany and its plugins and reinstall specifying the gtk2 flavor.

  Note that the following plugins are not available if using the new
  gtk3 flavor:

  * geany-plugin-debugger

                existing camera channels. The 'time_to_target_mins' channel
                of the 'thermostat' Thing Type is renamed to 'time_to_target'

  AUTHOR: woodsb02@FreeBSD.org

  The newsyslog.conf(5) filename installed by the port has been changed:
  OLD: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/${PORTNAME}
  NEW: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/${PORTNAME}.conf

  Any file found at the old location will be automatically moved to the new
  location. This will ensure log rotation will continue to work after change
  r340318 to FreeBSD base, where the default newsyslog configuration now only
  includes filenames that end with '.conf' and do not begin with '.'.

  If you use provisioning/configuration management tools to create or edit this
  file, you will need to change their configuration to use the new filename.

  AFFECTS: users of graphics/mesa-libs
  AUTHOR: jbeich@FreeBSD.org

  Wayland support has been enabled in ports where it doesn't exclude
  X11 support in order to make the binary packages usable with Wayland
  compositors. If you get strange build failures re-run "make config"
  to pick up the new defaults. If the extra dependencies are not
  desired add the following to make.conf:

    OPTIONS_UNSET += WAYLAND

  AUTHOR: dominik.lisiak@bemsoft.pl

  The "ossechids_enable" rc variable has been renamed to "ossec_hids_enable".

  If using database output, you need to recreate database using new schema
  provided in /usr/local/share/doc/ossec-hids.

  AUTHOR: dominik.lisiak@bemsoft.pl

  The ossec-hids-client port has been renamed to ossec-hids-agent.
  Portmaster users will need to run this command:

  portmaster -o security/ossec-hids-agent security/ossec-hids-client

  If the switch doesn't happen automatically for you, just delete the
  ossec-hids-client package and install ossec-hids-agent.

  The "ossechids_enable" rc variable has been renamed to "ossec_hids_enable".

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible*
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  Default Ansible configuration location changed to LOCALBASE/etc/ansible
  instead of a per-flavor directory. If you use system-wide Ansible
  configuration, please migrate from a flavored directory to a common
  one:

  # mv /usr/local/etc/py27-ansible /usr/local/etc/ansible

  AFFECTS: users of www/node
  AUTHOR: bhughes@FreeBSD.org

  The www/node port has been updated to Node.js v11.0.0, the latest
  upstream release. A new port, www/node10, has been created for the
  v10.x LTS branch. Users wanting to stay on v10.x can replace www/node
  with www/node8 with one of the following commands:

  # pkg install www/node10
    or
  # portmaster -o www/node10 www/node
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node10 www/node

20181022:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php71
  AUTHOR: joneum@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of PHP has been switched from 7.1 to 7.2.

  If you use binary packages you should make a list of php packages
  before running 'pkg upgrade':

  # pkg info php7\* > ~/installed-php-ports-list

  After the upgrade, check with such list if all your php extensions
  are still installed, and reinstall them if needed.

  If you use mod_php71 you need to deinstall it and install mod_php72.

20181020:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libressl
  AUTHOR: brnrd@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to the latest stable version 2.8 of LibreSSL.
  The shared library versions of the libraries have been bumped.

  After upgrading, manually update all packages that depend on any of the
  libraries provided by LibreSSL (libssl, libcrypto and libtls) since the
  versions of these libraries have changed. Normally, you can obtain the
  list of dependent software by running the following command:

  # pkg info -r libressl

  Then you should rebuild all ports depending on libressl to avoid dangling
  shared library dependencies. Poudriere and pkg handle this correctly,
  portmaster and portupgrade users can use the following to rebuild all
  dependent ports.

  Portmaster users:
      portmaster -r libressl
  Portupgrade users:
      portupgrade -fr security/libressl

20181018:
  AFFECTS: users of security/hitch
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  Hitch has been updated to run as the hitch user/group, instead of the
  previous default of nobody/nobody.  You should review your hitch
  configuration to ensure that everything has been updated to reflect
  this change.

20181014:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible
  AUTHOR: lifanov@FreeBSD.org

  Ansible has been updated to 2.7.0. Please follow the porting guide
  to update the rulesets:

  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides/porting_guide_2.7.html

  If you wish to stay with 2.6 version, you can switch
  to new sysutils/ansible2.6 port, which tracks stable 2.6 branch:

  # pkg set -n ansible:ansible26

20181010:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap and other courier ports
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Courier-IMAP 5.0.0 added IMAP UTF8 support, and converted maildir
  folders' names to Unicode.

  Updating an existing system to Courier-IMAP 5.0, and later,
  requires a manual one-time conversion of all existing maildirs
  using the maildirmake command. See the maildirmake(1) manual page
  for more information.

  All other courier ports accessing maildirs also need to be updated
  at the same time.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/pecl-xdebug*
  AUTHOR: pizzamig@FreeBSD.org

  xdebug 2.6.1 (devel/pecl-xdebug) is the new default version and it supports
  PHP from 7.0 to 7.2 included.
  If you're using PHP 5.6, the previous compatible xdebug version is still
  available in devel/pecl-xdebug25
  If you're using PHP 7.3, the only compatible xdebug version is available
  in devel/pecl-xdebug-devel
