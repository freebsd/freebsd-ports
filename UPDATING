This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

20060506:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/lua, especially KDE editor Kite users
  AUTHOR: pav@FreeBSD.org

  Recently, the port of Lua was updated to version 5.1.  This version is
  incompatible with the version 5.0, which is used in certain applications,
  most notable in KDE's editor Kite.  If you're having troubles running
  Kite, make sure you downgrade your lua installation back to 5.0:

  portupgrade -f -o lang/lua50 lua-5.1

20060501:
  AFFECTS: users of www/instiki
  AUTHOR: arsptr@optusnet.com.au

  The instiki port has changed storage methods to use an SQL database.
  The README contains instructions on how to migrate existing wiki data to the
  new storage methods.  The following is a copy of the relevant information,
  tailored for FreeBSD port users:

  1. cd /usr/ports/www/instiki; make extract
  2. Execute
      ruby work/instiki-0.11.0/script/import_storage \
          -t /usr/local/instiki/storage/2500 \
          -i /usr/local/instiki \
          -d sqlite \
          -o [some location]/instiki_import.sql
  3. This will produce instiki_import.sql file in the specified location.
     Open it in a text editor and inspect carefully.
  4. Upgrade your instiki port normally (eg portupgrade)
  5. Connect to your production database, eg:
       sqlite3 /usr/local/instiki/db/production.db.sqlite3
     and have it execute instiki_import.sql, eg:
       .read [some location]/instiki_import.sql
  6. Execute
       ruby /usr/local/instiki/script/reset_references production
     (this script parses all pages for crosslinks between them, so it
     may take a few minutes)

20060429:
  AFFECTS: All GNOME users
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.14.  This new release does NOT require the
  use of the gnome_upgrade.sh script.  That script should not be used.
  Instead, use the following simple recipe:

pkgdb -Ff
portupgrade -o net/avahi -f howl
portupgrade -o x11/gnome-screensaver -f xscreensaver-gnome
portupgrade -a

20060425:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: shaun@inerd.com

  ejabberd's UID and GID have changed. Users are advised to check all
  configuration files and data in /var/spool/ejabberd to ensure
  everything has the correct owner/group.

20060424:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/monotone
  AUTHOR: lapo@lapo.it

  Version 0.26 of monotone has many differences with past versions, there are
  changes in executable name, in repository and workspace format and also
  in the 'netsync' network protocol.
  A centralized "flagday" migration is needed in order to change format.
  Refer to ${PREFIX}/share/doc/monotone/UPGRADE for migration instructions.

20060418:
  AFFECTS: users of net/{ipw,iwi}-firmware
  AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  Some changes in the way ipw(4) and iwi(4) work lead to fundamental
  changes in ipw-firmware and iwi-firmware ports. Since these drivers
  are now using loadable kernel modules as firmware, two new ports have
  been created: net/ipw-firmware-kmod and net/iwi-firmware-kmod.

  You should not be able to install the wrong one since detection is
  base on your FreeBSD version. Trying to install the wrong port will
  result in an error message (port marked as IGNORE).

20060413:
  AFFECTS: users of security/tor-devel
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  The default data directory of tor-devel has been changed from
  /var/run/tor to /var/db/tor/data
  In order to keep your old server settings, you should either
  move the appropriate files to this directory manually,
  or set the tor_datadir variable accordingly in /etc/rc.conf

20060414:
  AFFECTS: users of www/horde, www/horde-php5, www/horde-passwd,
           deskutils/nag, deskutils/mnemo, deskutils/kronolith,
           mail/turba, mail/ingo, mail/imp, devel/chora
  AUTHOR: shaun@inerd.com

  The Horde ports no longer overwrite your existing configuration
  files during an upgrade: if you have modified any of the files in the
  config directory of any of these ports, they will be left untouched
  when you upgrade.

  It is recommended that the new .dist files are examined after an
  upgrade and any changes merged into your existing config files if
  necessary.

20060408:
  AFFECTS: users of www/linux-flashplugin*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  These ports have been removed because the End User License Agreement
  explicitly forbids to run the Flash Player on FreeBSD.
  For more details, see
    http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/license/desktop/.

20060407:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bacula*
  AUTHOR: dan@langille.org

  bacula-server now installs two rc.d scripts, one for the Director
  and one for the Storage Daemon. To enable the Director at boot time,
  set the following in /etc/rc.conf[.local]:

  bacula_dir_enable="YES"

  To enable the Storage Daemon, set the following in rc.conf(5):

  bacula_sd_enable="YES"

  Similarly, bacula-client also installs a rcNG script. To enable
  the File Daemon at boot time, set the following in rc.conf(5):

  bacula_fd_enable="YES"

  The old z-bacula.sh script in PREFIX/etc/rc.d should be removed.

20060403:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db*
  AUTHOR: swhetzel@gmail.com

  Most of the ports that depend on Berkeley DB have been updated to use
  Mk/bsd.database.mk.  Mk/bsd.database.mk is used to include MySQL, PostgreSQL,
  Berkeley DB, and SQLite in a port.

  The Berkeley DB support in Mk/bsd.database.mk is used to return the proper
  db* library name and location of the include and library directories of the
  requested version.

  To select a version of Berkeley DB, you can use either WITH_BDB_VER=<version>
  or ${UNIQUENAME}_WITH_BDB_VER=<version> (version is one of 3, 40, 41, 42, 43,
  or 44).

  When a port has USE_BDB defined as either 'USE_BDB=41+' or 'USE_BDB=yes', the
  port will use the oldest installed version of Berkeley DB. For example if
  both db41 and db43 are installed, the port would end up compling with db41.
  If you add -DWITH_BDB_HIGHEST to your make command, the port will use highest
  db* instead. If no Berkeley DB is installed then the port will default to the
  version specified or the default Berkeley DB version (currently db41).

  NOTE: If a port was using a different variable to select Berkeley DB or a
  version, you will get an IGNORE message when you build the port.  This
  message will tell you what you need to do.

  Port Maintainers please review the comments in Mk/bsd.database.mk on what
  variables are available for you use in your own ports.

20060331:
  AFFECTS: users of biology/emboss and biology/embassy
  AUTHOR: fernan@iib.unsam.edu.ar

  Since EMBOSS-3.0.0 both EMBOSS and EMBASSY install by default into
  $LOCALBASE/emboss to avoid conflicts with other ports.

  Users upgrading to 3.0.0 should take this into consideration when
  planning the upgrade, because it will involve moving data not
  installed by the port (databases) and tweaking the emboss.defaults
  config file.

  If you want to install the ports into $LOCALBASE (/usr/local, the old
  behaviour), you can still do so by setting PREFIX manually. But you
  will have to take care of conflicting ports yourself.

20060330:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@freebsd.org

  The genkdmconf.sh rc-script has been removed in favour of a kdm wrapper
  script, which now handles both launching kdm and automatically updating or
  generating kdm's configuration files. The actual kdm binaries have been
  renamed to 'kdm-bin', 'kdm-bin_config' and 'kdm-bin_greet' respectively.

  These changes should be mostly transparent to kdm users and require no
  changes to existing configurations or setups, however: The actual kdm process
  is now also named 'kdm-bin', so 'killall kdm' will no longer work.

20060328:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nut
  AUTHOR: Joerg.Pulz@frm2.tum.de

  Beginning with nut-2.0.3 the nut rcNG script only starts the ups driver and
  the ups daemon 'upsd'.

  The ups monitor 'upsmon' and the ups logger 'upslog' are now handled by
  seperate scripts to get more control over the different services.
  Please take a look into the nut, nut_upslog and nut_upsmon scripts
  installed in ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/ for possible rc.conf values and their
  defaults.

20060322:
  AFFECTS: users of security/dazuko
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  Do not load the module using /boot/loader.conf. It generates a page fault due
  to a possible dazuko bug.

  You could use /etc/rc.local for loading the module. For example, add the
  following line to /etc/rc.local:

    /sbin/kldload dazuko

20060319:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/py-exif
  AUTHOR: lawrance@FreeBSD.org

  The 'exiftool' utility from py-exif has been renamed to
  'py-exiftool' in order to avoid a conflict with p5-Image-ExifTool.

20060316:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/docproj[-jadetex]
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  docproj now installs a set of CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
  related stuff in case that you have choosen to install the
  jadetex feature.  Because the CJK part could be potentially
  large for those who do not want it, this feature can be disabled
  by defining WITHOUT_CJK=yes.

  Please be sure to update to the latest docproj package, as an
  upcoming doc/share/mk change will make use of the newly added
  fixrtf utility.

20060315:
  AFFECTS: users of www/horde, mail/turba and deskutils/kronolith
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  There are several points to check in your configuration files or
  in your database after upgrading Horde to 3.1, Turba to 2.1 and
  IMP to 4.1; please read UPGRADING in their doc directories.

20060315:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/jabber
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrade jabber-1.x to 1.4.4 you must to rewrite your
  ${PREFIX}/etc/jabber.xml based on new ${PREFIX}/etc/jabber.xml.dist
  installed by the port because it's not backward compatible.

20060313:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/vcdimager and security/dirmngr
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  These versions of the ports which have been installed in your
  system accidentally installed some malformed entries to
  $LOCALBASE/info/dir, which prevent them from being upgraded
  to the latest versions.  Please remove the following entries
  manually from $LOCALBASE/info/dir before upgrading them to
  vcdimager-0.7.23_2 (and later) and dirmngr-0.9.3_2 (and later)
  respectively.

  multimedia/vcdimager

20060307:
  AFFECTS: users of print/acroread7 and the localized versions
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Unfortunately, it turns out that printing feature of Adobe
  Reader 7.0.5 does not work with FreeBSD's Linux emulation
  environment for now.  Although English, French, German,
  Japanese, and Korean version of the port were updated to
  7.0.5 on 2006/02/21, these changes have been reverted consequently.

  Please update the packages installed (normal upgrading procedure
  by using portupgrade(1) and so on should work).  I am sorry for the
  confusion.

20060302:
  AFFECTS: net-im/jabber-pyicq and net-im/jabber-pymsn
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  Port versions older than 0.7 and 0.11a respectivly run as root which
  is an uneeded security risk.  Newer versions run as as user jabber,
  so before starting the daemons, you should fix permissions for each
  spooldir (default: /var/spool/jabber):

  # chown -R jabber:jabber spooldir/Transport_JID

20060223:
  AFFECTS: all ports using libtool as part of the build process
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  The way in which ports that require libtool to build has been
  completely reworked to bring the ports system in line with other
  environments, such as Linux, and pkgsrc.

  devel/libtool13 no longer exists.  devel/libtool15 has been modified
  to (a) install in the canonical locations and (b) remove a number
  of long-standing FreeBSD-specific patches that resulted in a very
  different libtool than is present on other systems.

  The main visible change will be that a large number of ports have
  had their plists modified (we now install libtool .la archives)
  and, as such, PORTREVISIONS have been bumped on ~2000 ports (roughly
  1/7th of the tree).

  Unfortunately, there is no simple upgrade path.  Short of removing
  all packages and reinstalling from scratch, the only other viable
  alternative would be careful use of portupgrade.  Given the large
  number of different ways in which libtool is used by other ports
  in the tree, this is a process that is likely to vary considerably
  from system to system, and as such, folks should be very mindful
  of running automatic updating software, such as portupgrade, making
  extensive use of the -n flag (and equivalents for other updaters)
  to see what will actually be rebuilt, before actually performing
  the upgrade.

  The good news is that the system now in place will make the handling
  of libtool-using ports considerably easier going forward.

20060221:
  AFFECTS: users of print/acroread7 and the localized versions
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  installation directory of print/acroread7 and the slave ports
  have been changed to ${PREFIX}/Adobe/Acrobat7.0/${ADOBE_LANG}.
  ${ADOBE_LANG} is one of CHS,CHT,DAN,DEU,ENU,ESP,FRA,ITA,JPN,KOR,
  NLD,NOR,PTB,SUO,SVE and represents language used in the UI (FRA means
  French version and it is installed by french/acroread, for example).
  To configure the UI language, navigate to Edit->Preferences->International->
  Application Language, set it to "Choose at application startup" and
  restart the program.

  The command filename is ${PREFIX}/bin/acroread as before (this is
  a script installed by print/acroreadwrapper now), and if multiple
  versions are installed, one of them will be selected according to
  ${ADOBE_LANG} environment variable.  If ${ADOBE_LANG} is not set,
  it will be automatically set by using ${LANG}; this means when
  LANG=fr_FR.ISO8859-15, ADOBE_LANG will be FRA and the French version
  will be invoked by ${PREFIX}/bin/acroread.  You can set ADOBE_LANG
  manually, too.

  Also, if you want to activate the PDF plugin, use --install-plugin
  option in ${PREFIX}/bin/acroread.  For more detail, see
  print/acroreadwrapper/pkg-message.

20060220:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 has been updated to 5.8.8.  You should update everything
  depending on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  perl-after-upgrade script supplied with lang/perl5.8.  Please see
  its manual page for details.

20060220:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/enlightenment
  AUTHOR: vanilla@FreeBSD.org

  enlightenment 0.16 change binary name from 'enlightenment' to 'e16'.
  you should change it on your .xinit file.
 
20060212:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dcc-dccd
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The midnight dccm and dccifd system log message has been changed to disclose
  spam passed from whiteclnt-listed MX servers. MX servers should now be listed
  in /var/dcc/whiteclnt with lines like:
                mx      ip      10.2.3.4
                mx      ip      10.5.6.0/28
                mxdcc   ip      10.7.8.9
  "MX" marks the IP address of one of your mail systems that should be ignored
  in initial Received: headers and when reported by sendmail to dccm. "MXDCC"
  marks IP addresss of your mail systems that run DCC clients and that will have
  already reported mail to the DCC. Continue using "OK" whitelist entries for
  mail systems that you trust to never send or forward unsolicited bulk email.
  Allow custom DNS blacklist SMTP rejection messages. See -Bset:rej-msg=X in the
  dccifd and dccm man pages.

20060207:
  AFFECTS: users of www/jakarta-tomcat4, www/jakarta-tomcat41, 
           www/jakarta-tomcat5, www/jakarta-tomcat55, and www/tomcat55
  AUTHOR: lawrance@FreeBSD.org

  The Tomcat ports listed above have been converted to use new-style
  rc scripts.  In order to enable Tomcat, you must add:

	tomcat{4,41,5,55}_enable="YES"

  to your rc.conf.  Select the appropriate version number for your
  installation.  When shutting down, the rc scripts will kill the
  Tomcat process after a default timeout of 10 seconds.  This can be
  changed by setting the tomcatXX_stop_timeout variable in rc.conf.

  Tomcat 5.5 users please note that the rc variables have changed name
  from jakarta_tomcat55_* to tomcat55_*.

  The "tomcatctl" executable is no longer installed.  Please use the
  rc scripts to control tomcat instead.

20060202:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/expat2
  AUTHOR: kuriyama@FreeBSD.org

  Users of expat2 (and its many dependencies) should do the following to
  properly update expat2 and all of its dependencies:

  portupgrade -rf textproc/expat2

20060201:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/xmbmon
  AUTHOR: jylefort@FreeBSD.org

  The tty program (mbmon) was moved into a separate port, sysutils/mbmon.

20060201:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/tilda
  AUTHOR: barner@FreeBSD.org

  The configuration file syntax has changed. Users of x11/tilda must 
  delete their old ones and re-create them.

20060131:
  AFFECTS: users of security/stunnel
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  Since stunnel-4.14_1, the stunnel.pem certificate generated by
  "make cert" is installed into /usr/local/etc/stunnel/ instead of
  /usr/local/etc/.

20060130:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portsnap
  AUTHOR: cperciva@FreeBSD.org

  Due to configuration file changes, users of portsnap are encouraged
  to copy the latest sample configuration file into place after updating
  portsnap to version 1.0:

  	# cd /usr/local/etc && cp portsnap.conf.sample portsnap.conf

20060126:
  AFFECTS: ports that use Display Postscript libraries and xorg-libraries
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  Support for Display Postscript has been deprecated in X.Org 6.9 release
  and libraries and tools are no longer installed by default. If you have
  installed a port that complains about missing libdpstk or libpsres, you
  need to reinstall it so it will be build without DPS support.

20060123:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/qmail, mail/qmail-ldap, mail/qmail-mysql,
           mail/qmail-spamcontrol, mail/qmail-tls and all dependant
           ports.
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  If you use qmail installed on a PREFIX different of /var/qmail,
  please, set a var on /etc/make.conf named QMAIL_PREFIX with this
  value. It'll be used for many ports that depends of qmail.

  To prevent stale dependencies, when you use one of qmail slave ports,
  now you just need to set a var named QMAIL_SLAVEPORT on /etc/make.conf
  assigning to it the name of slave port you are using.

  The valid options for now are:
  * ldap
  * mysql
  * spamcontrol
  * tls

20060114:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache13-ssl with suexec enabled.
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been converted to new apache framework, using bsd.apache.mk.
  suexec knobs have changed to WITH_SUEXEC and SUEXEC_*. See Mk/bsd.apache.mk
  for more details.

20060113:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/qvamps
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  Some program location pathnames have been corrected. Therefore,
  a new configuration file has to be generated. First, close qvamps.
  Then, remove the previous configuration file. Finally, start qvamps
  again. The configuration file can be removed with:

  $ rm ~/.qvamps/qvampsrc

20060112:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix, mail/postfix1, mail/postfix21,
		    mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: mnag@FreeBSD.org

  Now all postfix ports use rcNG script to startup. If you have any file
  in etc/rc.d directory linked to sbin/postfix, please remove.
  Do not forget to add 'postfix_enable="YES"' in your rc.conf

20060112:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  gnutls has been updated to 1.2.9 and all shared libraries' versions
  have been bumped. So you need to rebuild all applications that
  depend on gnutls. Do something like:

	portupgrade -rf gnutls

20060111:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/lxdvdrip
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  lxdvdrip has been updated to version 1.51 depending on port
  multimedia/vamps. However, multimedia/vamps needs to know beforehand
  how many bytes will be processed in order to work. Unfortunately,
  lxdvdrip cannot provide such information. Therefore, vamps and
  playcell specific tailored versions shipped within the lxdvdrip
  distribution will be used. They will be named so that lxdvdrip
  does not conflict with multimedia/vamps. This is for lxdvdrip
  version 1.51_1.

  However, users that used lxdvdrip previously to this update, are
  required to modify their configuration file in order to comply
  to the new naming scheme.

  File: ~/.lxdvdrip.conf
  From: play_cell_name=play_cell
        vamps_name=vamps
  To:   play_cell_name=play_cell_lxdvdrip
        vamps_name=vamps_lxdvdrip

20060111:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/perforce
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Perforce has been updated to version 2005.2. As usual, there has
  been significant schema upgrades, so even though upgrading to
  2005.2 is straightforward, it is still highly recommended to
  follow the upgrading instructions in the release notes:

    http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.052/user/relnotes.txt

20060110:
  AFFECTS: users of www/drupal
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  The default install location has changed from PREFIX/www/data/drupal
  to PREFIX/www/drupal.  Users who want to use the old location can set
  the DRUPDIR variable to www/data/drupal.

20060109:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-server
  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  All postgresql versions have been updated. These patch releases fix
  a problem with character string comparisons for locales that
  consider different character combinations as equal, such as
  Hungarian. This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on
  textual columns. Also, if plperl is used, a "REINDEX" might be
  required under certain conditions. Check the HISTORY file in the
  source for details.

20060108:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs3, x11/kdebase3, deskutils/superkaramba,
	            x11-themes/kde-windeco-smoothblend, irc/kvirc,
	            editors/vimpart
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  A number of files have been moved from kdebase to kdelibs between
  KDE 3.4.3 and KDE 3.5.0 and some applications which used to be
  distributed separately from KDE have been included in the release.

  This means that you will have to take some precautions in order to
  update your KDE installation without interruptions.

  We recommend sticking to the following procedure. This procedure requires you
  to have sysutils/portupgrade installed and to be the superuser (or using sudo).

  1.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

        pkg_deinstall -f kdebase-\[0-9\]\* superkaramba-\[0-9\]\* \
        kde-windeco-smoothblend-\[0-9]\* kvirc-\[0-9\]\* \
        kdeaddons-vimpart-\[0-9\]\*

  2.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

        portupgrade -O arts\* kde\* \*kde-i18n\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

        portupgrade -a

  3.) Reinstall the KDE ports you deleted in step 1.

        portinstall -O kdebase

  Superkaramba is now included in misc/kdeutils3.

  The smoothblend window decoration is now included in x11-themes/kdeartwork3.

  Vimpart is being discontinued and no longer part of KDE.

  KNOWN ISSUES:
  =============

  Just like KDE 3.4, KDE 3.5 does not play nice with openssl-0.9.8. In
  particular it breaks kwallet, some of the SSL handling in konqueror and
  SSL/TLS support in kmail/kontact.

  If you're using the openssl ports rather than the base-system openssl,
  make sure to use security/openssl-stable.

  You can put WITH_OPENSSL_STABLE=yes into /etc/make.conf to automatically
  make ports depend on that rather than on security/openssl.

  FreeBSD 4.x users MUST install openssl-stable even if the base openssl is
  present for SSL/TLS support in kmail/kontact to work. Unfortunately, the
  kdepim3 port cannot depend on it automatically due to shortcomings/bugs in
  ports-collection's openssl infrastructure.

  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kronolith <= 2.0.6 with MCAL backend
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  Beginning with release 2.1, the support of MCAL will be removed
  from Kronolith. To prepare your migration, you can already switch
  to a SQL back-end, with the script provided at
  /usr/local/www/horde/kronolith/scripts/migrate_to_sql_driver.php.

20060105:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail >= 6.3.0
  AUTHOR: barner@FreeBSD.org

  Beginning with release 6.3.0, fetchmail not only needs write
  access to the idfile ($HOME/.fetchids), but also to the directory
  holding this file. For end users running fetchmail with default
  idfile on their own account, nothing changes: they have write
  access to their home directory.

20060105:
  AFFECTS: users of www/wwwoffle, security/ipsec-tools
  AUTHOR: edwin@FreeBSD.org

  The startup of the rc.d scripts for these two ports are now
  by default disabled.

20051228:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/tovid
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  tovid shell scripts relies heavily on bash(1) but the previous
  port version tried to use sh(1). However, since there were too
  many complications, the port now depends on shells/bash.

  Due to this change, the configuration files need to be regenerated.
  Please, erase all previous configuration files. The configuration
  file samples will be generated on the 1st invocation of the
  scripts.

  $ rm ~/.tovid/*

20051228:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/scponly
  AUTHOR: rushani@FreeBSD.org

  From scponly 4.2, scp & WinSCP compatibilities are not enabled by default.
  To enable those compatibilities, define WITH_SCPONLY_SCP and/or
  WITH_SCPONLY_WINSCP, respectively.

20051225:
  AFFECTS: users of p5-libapreq2
  AUTHOR: vanilla@FreeBSD.org

  libapreq2 can be pure c library, I believe some people need pure c library,
  but hate mod_perl, so I split it to 2 ports, and set libapreq2 as
  p5-libapreq2's master ports.

  If you need pure library of libapreq2, install www/libapreq2.
  If you like mod_perl & enjoy p5-libapreq2, install/www/p5-libapreq2.

20051213:
  AFFECTS: users of pear ports
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  A few old pear ports have been removed from the tree in favor of a
  single devel/pear port.  If portupgrade complains about missing ports,
  you may safely remove pear-XML_RPC, pear-Console_Getopt, pear-Archive_Tar
  and php[45]-pear and then run:

  portupgrade -o devel/pear -f pear-PEAR

20051212:
  AFFECTS: users of net/ntop
  AUTHOR: wxs@csh.rit.edu

  ntop now installs a rcNG script.  It also logs to syslog by default.
  To enable ntop at boot time, set the following in rc.conf(5):

  ntop_enable="YES"

20051210:
  AFFECTS: users of net/mldonkey-devel
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  MLDonkey port net/mldonkey-devel has been patched to work with
  the updated lang/ocaml version 3.09. As a result, ocaml 3.09
  is now a requirement. You have to follow the instructions for
  updating your complete ocaml installation outlined below on
  20051201 by burelle@lri.fr.

  If you use the command below, everything should be fine.

  $ portupgrade -fr 'ocaml*' 'mldonkey-*devel*'

20051210:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/fetchmail using SSL encryption
  AUTHOR: barner@FreeBSD.org

  Fetchmail now checks the validity of server certificates and complains
  verbosely in maillog if the validation fails.

  If your mail server's certificate is not signed by one of the root
  authorities, you have to manually configure them using the following steps:

    * Download the necessary certificates in PEM format and store them
      at a suitable location, e.g. /home/user/.certs

    * Run the c_rehash tool on the freshly installed certificates:

      - If you are using OpenSSL from the base system (this is the default)
        use the following command:
	% perl /usr/src/crypto/openssl/tools/c_rehash /home/user/.certs

      - If you are using OpenSSL from security/openssl please use
        % c_rehash /home/user/.certs

    * Use the following options to enable SSL encryption in your .fetchmailrc
      configuration file:

      options ssl sslcertpath /home/user/.certs sslcertck
              sslfingerprint '< fingerprint >'
	      < other options >

20051208:

20051207:
  AFFECTS: users of {japanese,chinese,korean}/FreeWnn-*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  {ja,zh,ko}-FreeWnn-server now use the new rc.subr(8) framework
  for their startup script.  Note that to invoke each Wnn daemon at
  boot time you have to set the following variables in rc.conf(5)
  respectively:

  wnn_enable
  kwnn_enable
  twnn_enable
  cwnn_enable

20051203:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache2
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  www/apache2 port directory was renamed to www/apache20 to keep
  consistency with other apache ports.

20051203:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22 and any web apps porters
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  www/apache22 stop supporting ${LOCALBASE}/www/(data|error|cgi)(|-dist)
  directory layout in favor of ${LOCALBASE}/www/apache22/(data|error|cgi).
  FYI, ports layout may change soon.

20051202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/plone and cmf oriented zope modules
  AUTHOR: filippo.natali@gmail.com

  www/plone has been updated to the latest 2.1.1 version. Some
  zope modules are unfortunately incompatible with this version
  of plone.

20051202:
  AFFECTS: users of security/racoon and security/ipsec-tools
  AUTHOR: lawrance@FreeBSD.org

  security/racoon has been removed.  You should migrate to its
  replacement, security/ipsec-tools.  No configuration changes will
  be required.

  The default configuration file location has changed for ipsec-tools.
  You will need to move your racoon configuration files to the new
  location /usr/local/etc/racoon.  Alternatively, add this line in
  rc.conf to continue using the old location:

  racoon_flags="-f /usr/local/etc"

20051201:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ocaml
  AUTHOR: burelle@lri.fr

  Upgrade to 3.09.0 will break binary compatibility at link time, so any
  library build with old versions should be rebuild in order to be
  usable (standalone binaries do not require rebuild since they are
  statically linked.)

20051129:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/monotone
  AUTHOR: lapo@lapo.it

  Keys are now stored in ~/.monotone/keys/.
  You must run 'db migrate' against each of your databases;
  this will automatically migrate the keys.
  Command line syntax for 'serve' has changed; please adjust
  startup scripts accordingly.
  See /usr/local/share/doc/monotone/NEWS for details.

20051123:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  A change has been committed against www/lighttpd, which flips the
  meaning of the IPV6 option to match other ports, along with the
  1.4.7 upgrade.  If you have previously saved configuration that
  checks the IPV6 option (meaning to disable IPv6), then you will
  have to rerun the configuration with ``make config''.

  The default setting for IPV6 build is kept, which was enabled by
  default.

20051113:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xterm, x11/xorg-clients, x11/XFree86-4-clients
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  Xterm no longer installs with '-static' prefix. Users should upgrade
  XFree86-clients to 4.5.0_1 or xorg-clients to 6.8.2_1 or newer before
  attempting upgrade of xterm to 206_1 or newer. Previous versions remove
  xterm on deinstall so CONFLICTS have been set accordingly.

  AFFECTS: all users of gnome/glib/gtk
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.12 and gtk/glib to 2.8.
  DO NOT USE portupgrade(1) to update your ports. Instead, use

20051104:
  AFFECTS: users of www/trac
  AUTHOR: rui@ruilopes.com

  The Trac database schema was changed between versions 0.8 and 0.9. This
  port also started to use PySQLite 2 (SQLite 3).  Existing environments
  must be upgraded before they can be used with Trac 0.9.

  The canonical update procedure for existing trac environments is:

  $ export TRAC_ENV=/path/to/trac/env
  $ # backup existing trac environment
  $ cp -Rp $TRAC_ENV $TRAC_ENV.backup # backup existing trac env
  $ # convert database from sqlite 2 to sqlite 3 format
  $ mv $TRAC_ENV/db/trac.db $TRAC_ENV/db/trac2.db
  $ sqlite $TRAC_ENV/db/trac2.db .dump | sqlite3 $TRAC_ENV/db/trac.db
  $ # upgrade trac environment
  $ /usr/local/bin/trac-admin $TRAC_ENV upgrade
  $ /usr/local/bin/trac-admin $TRAC_ENV resync

  # portupgrade -o www/mediawiki14 -f mediawiki

20051013:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/qmrtg
  AUTHOR: mij@bitchx.it

  Version 2.x marks a new generation for qmrtg and is no longer compatible
  with configuration files from old releases.

  Upgrading to 2.x version *requires* qmrtg (and possibly mrtg)
  configuration files to be adjusted manually starting from the .dist file
  included.

  AFFECTS: users of games/py-slune
  AUTHOR: mnag@FreeBSD.org

  games/py-slune has been removed to add in games/slune to
  reflect right name.

20051010:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apache-ant
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The Ant launcher script now uses javavmwrapper to pick a suitable JDK. Hence
  it is no longer needed to define JAVA_HOME for Ant to run. You may rather use
  and combination of JAVA_VERSION, JAVA_OS and JAVA_VENDOR. See javavm(1) for
  further information. However, you may still override this behavior using
  JAVACMD.

  The ANT_INCLUDE_SHARED_JARS variable used to be effective only when set to
  "YES" (case sensitive). It is now a defined/undefined switch and thus will be
  effective if defined, regardless of its value.

20051009:
  AFFECTS: users of games/py-balazar
  AUTHOR: mnag@FreeBSD.org

  games/py-balazar has been removed to add in games/balazar to

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/rdiff-backup, rdiff-backup-devel
  AUTHOR: lawrance@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/rdiff-backup has been upgraded to version 1.0.1.  This
  version is incompatible with the previous version.  Users of
  rdiff-backup will need to redo their initial seed.

  rdiff-backup-devel has been removed.  Users of rdiff-backup-devel
  should now use rdiff-backup instead.  In this case there is no need
  to redo the initial seed.

20051006:
  AFFECTS: users of net/smokeping
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Smokeping has undergone a major upgrade to version 2.0.3. If you

  AUTHOR: marcus@corp.grupos.com.br

  Now version 1.0.4 of libspf2 has repo copied from mail/libspf2 to
  mail/libspf2-10 and mail/libspf2 has updated to 1.2.5.
  mail/exim depends on mail/libspf2 and mail/postfix, mail/postfix21
  and mail/postfix-policyd-spf depends on mail/libspf2-10.

20050907:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/metakit
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The metakit build now enables python support by default. Everybody who

  METAKIT_WITHOUT_PYTHON=yes on build.

20050904:
  AFFECTS: users of games/pvpgn
  AUTHOR: mek@mek.uz.ua

  sql_DB_layout.conf-sample: includes changes needed for the new "username" SQL
  field; if you update to 1.7.8 YOU MUST update this file too if you have your
  accounts on SQL

  bnetd.conf-sample: changed "servaddrs" directive to not be totally commented
  and be as ":" by default in bnetd.conf (if "servaddrs" is commented this
  means "bnetd" will not listen for b.net services at all)

20050902:
  AFFECTS: users of www/jakarta-tomcat55
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The port installs a new RCng startup script which no longer uses tomcat55ctl to
  control the Tomcat daemon. Furthermore, the behavior of Tomcat may be
  configured through switches and variables from /etc/rc.conf. They are
  documented in the header of the RCng script:

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/kdeadmin3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  One data file has been moved from kdeadmin to kdelibs between
  KDE 3.4.1 and KDE 3.4.2.  This means that

  *********if you currently have the kdeadmin port installed*********

  you will have to take some precautions to update your KDE
  installation.

  We recommend sticking to the following procedure. This procedure requires you
  to have sysutils/portupgrade installed and to be the superuser (or using sudo).

  1.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

        pkg_deinstall -f kdeadmin-\[0-9\]\*

  2.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

        portupgrade -O arts\* kde\* \*kde-i18n\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

        portupgrade -a

  3.) Reinstall the KDE ports you deleted in step 1.

        portinstall -O kdeadmin

20050728:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/sge and sysutils/sgeee
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  A port of SGE 6 has been installed in sysutils/sge.  SGE 6 is
  significantly different from SGE 5 and an upgrade is only possible
  by removing the SGE 5 install and replacing it.  The SGE vs SGEEE
  distinction has been removed in SGE 6 so the sgeee port was removed.
  The sge and sgeee ports were repo copied to sge53 and sgeee53
  respectively and existing installations may continue to use them.

20050727:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/firebird-server
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  Changes in layout:
  * database directory has changed from /usr/local/firebird to /var/db/firebird
  * configuration files are placed in /usr/local/etc/firebird
  * common utilities have been moved to /usr/local/bin
  * suid-ed binaries have been moved to /usr/local/sbin

  Update inetd.conf/xinetd.conf to reflect new location of "fb_inet_server".

20050722:
  AFFECTS: All RELENG_6 and HEAD users of ports/packages, maintainers
	   of ports that interact with the compat libraries.
  AUTHOR: kensmith@FreeBSD.org

  The shared library version number of all shared libraries built as
  part of the baseline system has been incremented in both RELENG_6
  and HEAD.  The overall goal is to make handling of the compat library
  infrastructure easier.  Each new release branch will have different
  version numbers for all of the shared libraries and the compat ports
  can simply include all of the shared libraries from the previous
  release.

  If you update your system using normal cvsup/rebuild/reinstall
  mechanisms the old versions of the libraries will still be on your
  system so your old ports executables will continue to work.
  But you definitely should plan on recompiling and reinstalling all
  of your installed ports so they get relinked against the new libraries.
  If you don't take this step as time goes on "normal" updates and
  installs run the risk of having executables relying on both the new
  and old versions of the libraries which would cause big problems.

  It will take some time for the pre-built packages available on the
  FTP mirror sites to be rebuilt against the new libraries.  If you
  want to update your ports using the pre-built packages watch the
  mailing lists for when the rebuilt packages become available.

20050710:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/qt33, x11/kdelibs3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you have compiled qt33 with the KDE_OPTIONS option checked (if your
  installed qt-package is called qt-copy-3.3.4 instead of qt-3.3.4, check
  with pkg_info), you should cvsup and recompile qt33 and everything
  depending on it:

  portupgrade -rf qt\*

  Previous versions of the qt33 port contained a patch that
  introduces binary incompatibility between unpatched qt33 and software
  compiled against a patched qt33.

  Symptoms of the binary incompatibility: Unresolved symbol warnings from
  various KDE/Qt applications (both during runtime or compiling/linking),
  "Could not start kdeinit" dialogs during KDE startup, kicker crashes during
  exiting KDE.

20050630:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  Due to several complaints, new (unsupported) option had been added to port
  Makefile: WITH_LEGACY_GPU_SUPPORT.  Starting with version 7667, NVidia has
  dropped support for numerous "legacy" GPUs, while this option allows to go
  with previous version of driver (this does not apply to older versions of
  FreeBSD, since you have to use version 6113 of driver (if you did not yet
  upgraded to FreeBSD 5.3 or later) which has support for those GPUs).

  If you must use WITH_LEGACY_GPU_SUPPORT option, be sure to ``hold'' the
  package by making appropriate entry in your pkgtools.conf, otherwise
  portupgrade(1) will upgrade your port to latest NVidia release on the
  next run, which is probably not what you want.

  Refer to x11/nvidia-driver/Makefile for further details.

20050625:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nut

20050624:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 has been updated to 5.8.7.  You should update everything
  depending on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  perl-after-upgrade script supplied with lang/perl5.8.  Please see
  its manual page for details.

20050622:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd-*
  AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  ProFTPd binary moved from ${PREFIX}/libexec to ${PREFIX}/sbin. People
  using proftpd with inetd must use ${PREFIX}/sbin/in.proftpd (or
  ${PREFIX}/sbin/proftpd which is just the same). Read the commit log
  and diffs for more information.

20050621:
  AFFECTS: users of net/cacti
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  Because of users need to keep their DB configuration but config.php
  can't be saved on upgrading, I've moved DB settings in db-settings.php.
  So, you need to change db-settings.php and do not touch config.php
  anymore.

20050618:
  AFFECTS: users of alternate linux_base ports
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The Ports Collection now allows to override the default linux_base port.
  Specify e.g. OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=rh-9 in /etc/make.conf to use
  ${PORTSDIR}/emulators/linux_base-rh-9 (the logic is to use
  ${PORTSDIR}/emulators/linux_base-${OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT}).

20050610:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/wget built with SSL (default)
  AUTHOR: sf@FreeBSD.org

  wget 1.10 now authenticates certificate of remote host before making a
  SSL connection. To make it work, you should have working CA root
  certificates list in /etc/ssl/cert.pem.

  If you don't have it there are options:
  a) install security/ca-roots port and you have done.
  b) install ftp/curl port and symlink it to /etc/ssl/cert.pem.
      ln -s /usr/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt /etc/ssl/cert.pem
  c) put your favorite one into certain place.

  Sylpheed-claws is updated to the GTK2 version now. This results in a new
  configuration directory. To keep your configuration from the GTK1 version
  you can
      cp -rp ~/.sylpheed .sylpheed-gtk2
  before starting the GTK2 version for the first time, or
      cp -Rp ~/.sylpheed .sylpheed-gtk2/
  when you have run the GTK2 version already.

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mpeg4ip and multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with version 1.3 mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 installs libmp4av that mpeg4ip
  previously installed. It is advised to de-install mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 and
  mpeg4ip before updating to mpeg4ip-1.3 or mpeg4ip-libmp4v2-1.3. If you
  have already updated mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 and mpeg4ip you should deinstall
  mpeg4ip and reinstall mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 before updating mpeg4ip.

  This does not affect users who just have mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 installed
  and not mpeg4ip.

  AUTHOR: girgen@FreeBSD.org

  The PostgreSQL ports have been updated to latest versions. A
  security problem in the template database requires a simple SQL
  command to be run on each database. Because these problems are
  really incorrect system catalog entries, updating to a new release
  will NOT by itself solve the problems in an existing
  installation.

  directory and remove it, like this:

        # cp -Rp ~/.opera ~/.opera-bak
        # rm -rf ~/.opera/*

  After that, you can put your bookmarks, email, contacts, etc. back in
  ~/.opera/. The most important files are your bookmarks
  (~/.opera/opera6.adr) and your emails (~/.opera/mail). It is not a good
  idea to put opera6.ini, userstyle.ini, search.ini, pluginpath.ini and other
  non-personal stuff back in ~/.opera/. If you need custom settings,
  reconfigure Opera from the preferences pane or edit the files by hand.

  After that, you can put your bookmark, email, contacts and etc back in
  ~/.linux-opera/. The bookmark is ~/.linux-opera/opera6.adr and the email is
  ~/.linux-opera/mail as you can figure out by view in ~/.linux-opera/. It is
  probably not good idea to put opera6.ini, userstyle.ini, search.ini,
  pluginpath.ini and other non-personal stuff back in ~/.linux-opera/. The

  AFFECTS: users of x11/kde3, x11/kdelibs3, x11/kdebase3,
	x11-themes/kdeartwork3, www/akregator, x11-themes/phase,
	multimedia/kdemultimedia3
  AUTHOR: kde@freebsd.org

  In KDE 3.4, a number of files were moved between ports, some ports
  were added, one port has been removed and some applications formerly available
  in their own ports were incorporated into KDE. This means that you will have
  to take some precautions to update your KDE installation. A simple
  portupgrade -a will not work.

  Portupgrade -R kde can fail as well, depending on what parts of KDE you
  have currently installed. We therefore recommend sticking to the following
  procedure. The procedure requires you to have sysutils/portupgrade installed
  and you to be the superuser (or using sudo). We recommend not being logged in
  to a KDE session on the machine you're performing the upgrade on. If you
  choose to perform the update while being logged in to KDE, expect erratic
  behavior and crashes from applications launched until you log out and back
  in.

  1.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

      	pkg_deinstall -f kdeartwork-\[0-9\]\* kdebase-\[0-9\]\* \
	kdebase-konqueror-nsplugins-\[0-9\]\* kdewebdev-\[0-9\]\* \
	kde-\[0-9\]\* akregator\* phase\*

  2.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

      	portupgrade -O arts\* kde\* \*kde-i18n\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

      	portupgrade -a

  3.) Reinstall the KDE ports you deleted in step 1.

      	portinstall -O kdebase kdeartwork kdewebdev

   Changes in detail:

	- www/akregator is now included into deskutils/kdepim3.
	- x11-themes/phase is now included in x11-themes/kdeartwork3.
	- www/konqueror-nsplugins has been removed and is now integrated into
          x11/kdebase3.
	- Juk has been split out of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 and is now
          available as audio/juk.
	- Akode has been split out of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 and is now
          available as audio/akode and audio/akode-plugins-*. Akode is also
	  a default dependency of multimedia/kdemultimedia3 now.
	- audio/mpeglib_artsplug has been demoted to legacy status and is no
          longer the default decoder backend for kdemultimedia3. It's also not
          depended on by kdemultimedia3 by default anymore.

  Known post-updating issues:

  - If you're missing acoustic notifications (system sounds) after the update:

    	rm ~/.kde/share/config/knotifyrc

    Then log out of KDE and back in again (also see
    http://freebsd.kde.org/faq.php#q16).

  - kdm users might get warnings from kdm about obsolete lines in kdmrc.
    You can migrate your configuration while preserving your customizations
    by running (as root or with sudo)

    	genkdmconf

    Make sure to backup your old kdm configuration (usually found in
    /usr/local/share/config/kdm) beforehand in case the merge produces an
    invalid configuration. Especially note that kdm does not use the Xservers
    file anymore. A genkdmconf run will merge its contents into kdmrc.

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portsnap
  AUTHOR: cperciva@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of shifting from SHA-1 to SHA-256, the structure of
  portsnap's configuration file and compressed snapshot have both
  changed.  After upgrading to portsnap 0.9, you will have to
  update your configuration file ($PREFIX/etc/portsnap.conf) and
  delete your existing portsnap compressed snapshot:

  	# cd /usr/local/etc && cp portsnap.conf.sample portsnap.conf
  	# rm -r /usr/local/portsnap/*

  In addition, be aware that the next runs of "portsnap fetch" and
  "portsnap update" will take far longer than usual, since they
  will need to download and extract a complete copy of the ports
  tree.

  Gnome has been upgraded to 2.10 and gtk/glib to 2.6.
  DO NOT USE portupgrade(1) to update any gnome or gtk

  - Maildir quota is now enabled by default.
    The following options were deleted:
    - WITH_MAILDIRQUOTA
    - WITH_TRASHQUOTA
  - New option WITH_AUTHLIB is added, which provides optional support for
    Courier Auth Library (mail/courier-authlib port).
  - Userdb authentication, LDAP and MySQL support are provided through
    courier-authlib now, thus the following options
    - WITH_USERDB
    - WITH_LDAP
    - WITH_MYSQL
    have been superseded by WITH_AUTHLIB.

20050306:
  AFFECTS: users of math/ploticus

  1) Update i2p port to the new one
  2) Use the i2prouter script to uninstall i2p from user account.
     You are going to lose all your configuration.

  With the move to Ganglia 3.0.0, the configuration file for gmond has
  changed completely.  The -r or --convert options may be used to
  emit a file in the new format given one in the old.

  Startup is now controlled by an RC_SUBR script so the gmond_enable and
  gmetad_enable variables will need to be set for gmond and gmetad to be
  started.  Existing gmond.sh and gmetad.sh scripts in PREFIX/etc/rc.d
  should be removed.

  Due to a bug in ganglia's build process, the previous version may need

  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX-*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/teTeX-* are now based on teTeX 3.0.  Although some
  reliability fixes are also added, here are several common problems
  which you might fall on.

  1) $PREFIX/bin/pdftex is missing:

   Probably your system has old files included teTeX 2.x which can
   prevent the new version from working.  Please remove the old
   files first (see 20050206 in this file) and reinstall.

  2) Some formats are still corrupted (for example, "Fatal format file error;
     I'm stymied" is displayed) or not updated even after a clean install:

   You might have old or corrupted *.fmt and/or *.map files
   under /root/.texmf-* or $HOME/.texmf-* directories.  Typically
   these directories are generated when you invoke the updmap(1),
   texconfig(1), or fmtutil(1) utility manually.  However, for a period
   after the first revision of the teTeX-base port erroneously used
   fmtutil(1) to regenerate *.fmt files, you could have these directories
   without your intent.  In such a case, please remove these directories
   and reinstall the ports (it is not needed to rebuild ports/packages).
   Just for your information, $HOME/.texmf-config and $HOME/.texmf-var
   can be used for your personal configuration.

  If you have other problems, please contact hrs@FreeBSD.org.

  The dependency on x11-fonts/mkbold and x11-fonts/mkitalic has been
  switched over to x11-fonts/mkbold-mkitalic, which is written in C
  and has far better performance than the old ones.  There is no
  functional difference between the two, but they will conflict with
  each other.  Since other ports which depend on x11-fonts/mkbold or
  x11-fonts/mkitalic will be updated to depend on x11-fonts/mkbold-mkitalic,
  you might get an error during upgrading such ports.  In such a case,
  please pkg_delete the old ones first.

  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/teTeX is now based on a teTeX 3.0 release candidate
  (2.99.13.20050204) and the other related ports are also updated.
  Since upgrading from previous versions should be done at a time,
  you may want to use the portupgrade utility or reinstall
  print/teTeX after deinstalling all of the related ports.

  If your teTeX environment became broken during the upgrade,
  please see the following URL which explains how to fix it.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ruby16_r, lang/ruby18_r, and lang/ruby18
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  The slippery pthread support for systems prior to 502102 has been
  dropped and lang/ruby16_r and lang/ruby18_r ports have been removed,
  since no one seems to appreciate the partially working solution.

  Good news is that the pthread support of lang/ruby18 is now enabled
  by default for newer systems, which means the ruby interpreter is
  linked with libpthread.  This will allow threaded extension
  libraries to run and work properly on those systems.

20050201:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5 and lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5 has been updated to 5.6.2, and lang/perl5.8 has been
  updated to 5.8.6. you should update everything depending on perl, that
  is:

    * first, upgrade your perl installation (use either lang/perl5 or
      lang/perl5.8, the latter being recommended);
    * for FreeBSD 4.X, run "use.perl port", so that the system knows you
      have 5.8.6 or 5.6.2;  this step is not needed on FreeBSD 5.X and
      FreeBSD -CURRENT;
    * run some magic incantations to upgrade all ports depending on perl,
      that is run something like :
      portupgrade -f `(pkg_info -R perl-5\* |tail +4; \
        find /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.[68].[1245] -type f -print0 \
        | xargs -0 pkg_which -fv | sed -e '/: ?/d' -e 's/.*: //')|sort -u`

  AFFECTS: users of PostgreSQL
  AUTHOR: seanc@FreeBSD.org

  The -devel port has been updated to contain 8.0 release since
  postgresql80-server can not be updated until 4.11 is released and the
  changes in PR ports/75344 are committed.  Users who need 8.0 now can
  use the -devel port, however, once postgresql80-server has been
  committed, -devel will begin tracking 8.1.  Please be smart about
  tracking ports and if used in production, update to
  databases/postgresql80-server as soon as it becomes available.  No
  dump/reload will be required when changing from -devel to
  postgresql80-server.

20050114:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libgnomesu, esp. on FreeBSD 4.x.
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  If you installed libgnomesu the day it was added to the ports tree,
  you have a malformed PAM control file in /etc/pam.d/. All libgnomesu
  users should remove /etc/pam.d/gnomesu-pam, and 5.x users should
  replace it with the version in the updated libgnomesu port (ensure
  that you're using the most current revision of the libgnomesu port).

  4.x users: listen up! The presence of the /etc/pam.d/ directory (and
  anything in that directory) presents a Very Bad Thing. Unless you've
  manually tweaked your PAM settings, you must run:

  	# rm /etc/pam.d/gnomesu-pam
  	# rmdir /etc/pam.d/

  or all users will be locked out of your system!

20050110:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/iip
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  iip has been updated to the new network servers. Therefore, both
  old configuration files and node reference keys no longer apply.

  Therefore, you need to update the configuration files for each
  user running the iip isproxy daemon:

  1) Backup configuration files

  cp ~/.iip/isproxy.ini ~/.iip/isproxy.ini.backup
  cp ~/.iip/node.ref ~/.iip/node.ref.backup

  2) Remove configuration files

  rm ~/.iip/isproxy.ini
  rm ~/.iip/node.ref

  3) Create new configuration. Fill information as requested. This
  creates the updated isproxy.ini file

  isproxy -C

  4) Start iip isproxy. This will initialize your updated node.ref
  file. This file will be automatically updated when you connect
  to the iip network

  isproxy

20050110:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/nautilus-cd-burner
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Nautilus-cd-burner now requires cdrtools built with UTF-8 encoding
  support.  The default sysutils/cdrtools port does not support this
  encoding, and that will cause nautilus-cd-burner to enter an infinite
  loop when trying to create CD images.  To workaround this, the cdrtools
  dependency was changed in nautilus-cd-burner to point to the
  sysutils/cdrtools-cjk port instead.

  Since sysutils/cdrtools and sysutils/cdrtools-cjk conflict, you must
  uninstall cdrtools so that the nautilus-cd-burner update can properly
  pull in cdrtools-cjk.

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap, mail/sqwebmail
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  Courier-imap and sqwebmail are now dependent on courier-authlib. If
  you've changed the default authentication config for courier-imap or
  sqwebmail, you will have to redo the changes for courier-authlib.
  You may wish to deinstall courier-imap and/or sqwebmail before you
  install courier-authlib. Since courier-authlib replaces parts of both
  ports, some of courier-authlib's files are listed as sqwebmail and
  courier-imap files and deinstalling old courier-imap and/or sqwebmail
  port may cause the deinstallation of the freshly installed
  courier-authlib files.

20050108:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sqwebmail
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  Sqwebmail now installs it's files directly under PREFIX. That means for
  instance that files that were formerly found under
  PREFIX/share/sqwebmail/etc/ are now located under PREFIX/etc/sqwebmail.
  Furthermore you need to set sqwebmaild_enable=YES in your rc.conf
  because the rc.d script has been migrated to use the rc.subr Subsystem

  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3, x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: lofi@freebsd.org

  If KDE does not start anymore after upgrading Xorg to version 6.8.1
  (X restarts when the KDE splash screen has reached the third icon),
  please check whether the directory /tmp/.ICE-unix exists, is owned by root
  and has permissions 1777 (read/write/access for everybody + sticky bit).

  To make sure everything is in working order, do (as root):
  mkdir -p /tmp/.ICE-unix && chmod 1777 /tmp/.ICE-unix &&
  chown root:wheel /tmp/.ICE-unix

  Also, make sure you do NOT have clear_tmp_enable="YES" set in /etc/rc.conf,
  as it will remove the directory on every reboot and applications will re-
  create it with the wrong ownership.

  Users of daily_clean_tmps_enable in /etc/periodic.conf should make sure
  daily_clean_tmps_ignore contains /tmp/.ICE-unix.

  AFFECTS: users of Horde and the related ports (Turba, IMP, Nag, Kronolith,
           Mnemo, Chora)
  AUTHOR: thierry@FreeBSD.org

  As of this update, the configuration files are generated by the application,
  with no support for configuration files used in previous versions.

  All data saved in the database, LDAP or MCAL backends will be preserved,
  considering that you run specific scripts to migrate to this new scheme.
  Affected ports are www/horde, mail/turba, deskutils/nag, deskutils/kronolith,
  and deskutils/mnemo. See the UPGRADING documentation of the ports in question
  for more details.

  The filter system of IMP 3.x has been replaced by a separate application:

  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/XFree86-4-Server and graphics/dri
  AUTHOR: lesi@FreeBSD.org

  As of version 4.4.0_6, XFree86-4-Server now depends on
  graphics/xfree86-dri.  This is due to incompatibilities between
  XFree86 and the new xorg 6.8.1 DRI.

  Users of XFree86-4-Server are strongly encouraged to switch to
  the xfree86-dri port as follows:

	portupgrade -fo graphics/xfree86-dri graphics/dri

  which will also fix dependencies.

  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme03
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  security/gpgme03 has been modified to not conflicts with gpgme 1.x
  After upgrade, you need to rebuild all ports that depend on it.
  You should upgrade security/gpgme (if installed) to avoid nasty
  compile time failures, due to original location of gpgme.h.

20041219:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/jdictionary
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  The location for JDictionary port installed files has changed. This also

  AFFECTS: users of security/cryptplug, deskutils/kdepim3
  AUTHOR: lofi@freebsd.org

  The cryptplug port is not compatible with recent versions of gpgme
  and has been changed to depend on gpgme03 (the last version of gpg-
  me compatible with cryptplug).
  Users who have been using cryptplug in order to enable PGP/MIME support
  in KMail should DEINSTALL BOTH cryptplug and gpgme03 before updating
  KDE to version 3.3.2. Cryptplug is NOT necessary anymore to enable
  PGP/MIME support in KMail and will cause the kdepim3 build to fail due
  to conflicting dependencies.

  There is a known quirk when using mail/getmail with Python 2.4
  where the DeprecationWarning is printed regarding the use of
  the 'strict' keyword when a message is being retrieved.

  You can redirect stdout/stderr to /dev/null to quelch the warning.

  The quirk may be fixed in a future version of getmail.

20041205:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/ffmpeg
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/ffmpeg will not work if previous versions of the port
  are installed. Also, there is a shared library version bump on
  this update. Therefore:

  1) Remove old ffmpeg

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/ffmpeg*

  2) Install updated ffmpeg

  3) Rebuild all ports that depend on ffmpeg due to the shared
  library version bump

  cd /var/db/pkg && portupgrade -rf ffmpeg* -x ffmpeg*

20041202:
  AFFECTS: users of any ports which have dependency on lang/python
  AUTHOR: perky@FreeBSD.org

  After upgrading of lang/python, you must rebuild all its consumer

    cp -R ~/.rawdog ~/.rawdog-old
    rm ~/.rawdog/state
    rawdog -u
    rawdog --upgrade ~/.rawdog-old ~/.rawdog
    rawdog -w

  Once you're happy with the new version:
    rm -r ~/.rawdog-old

20041118:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: lofi@freebsd.org

  portsdb(1) is part of the portupgrade suite and is used to convert a ports
  INDEX file to a binary INDEX.db database. By default, it uses the
  libc-builtin berkeley db to do so, which has a buggy btree implementation.

  If you see errors like "[BUG] Segmentation fault" while a portsdb update is
  in progress, adjust the PORTS_DBDRIVER variable (in your environment or in
  pkgtools.conf) to either bdb1_hash or dbm_hash.

  This problem was fixed in 5.3-RELEASE, but users of 4.10-RELEASE and
  5.2.1-RELEASE (and older releases) will find fixes by updating to the
  latest (at least after Sep 20) of RELENG_4 or RELENG_5.

20041116:
  AFFECTS: users of www/bricolage
  AUTHOR: ports@rbt.ca

  Bricolage may now be run on mod_perl compiled as a DSO for Apache
  when following these guidelines:

  http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/install.html#When_DSO_can_be_Used

  To do this, you will need to:
    pkg_delete -f apache-mod_perl
    pkg_delete -f p5-libapreq-static
    portupgrade -rR bricolage

  Bricolage will rebuild mod_perl, apache and libapreq using their standard
  versions.

20041115:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: lofi@FreeBSD.org

  Due to the recent removal of INDEX and INDEX-5 from FreeBSD's CVS,
  portupgrade with default configuration will run 'make index' if started
  after cvsup'ing the ports-collection. This may take an undesirably long
  time.

  There are several ways to work around this, for example:

  - Run 'make fetchindex' after cvsup'ing ports.

  or

  - Adjust the PORTS_INDEX variable in your environment or in
    pkgtools.conf (see portupgrade(1) or the default pkgtools.conf) to
    a different value than the default.

  Also remember that 'make index' is only supported on _complete_
  ports-trees. If you are currently refusing whole categories by means
  of a cvsup refuse file, use 'make fetchindex' instead (or consider
  keeping an extra machine/jail with a complete ports-tree around to
  do INDEX builds on).

20041111:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/faad, multimedia/mpeg4ip
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  mpeg4ip has been updated and broken down into 2 separate ports:
  mpeg4ip and mpeg4ip-libmp4v2. Furthermore, mpeg4ip now depends
  on faad. Moreover, faad now depends on mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 rather
  than on mpeg4ip which avoids a cyclic dependency (mpeg4ip depends
  on faad which depends on mpeg4ip).

  If any of the old ports are installed, mpeg4ip will not compile.
  Therefore,

  1) Remove old faad and mpeg4ip ports which conflict with new
  mpeg4ip

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/mpeg4ip*
  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/faad*

  2) Install faad, mpeg4ip and mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 in the following
  order

  cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mpeg4ip-libmp4v2 && make install clean
  cd /usr/ports/audio/faad && make install clean
  cd /usr/ports/multimedia/mpeg4ip && make install clean

  AFFECTS: users of Java
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  javavmwrapper has been rewritten.  It now creates symbolic links for
  all executables of the Java VMs that have been registered with it.
  These symbolic links may impact which version of Java you are using,
  depending on your PATH, which may need to be adjusted.

  For example, if your path is:

	${LOCALBASE}/bin:${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin

  then previously "java" would resolve to ${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin/java.
  With the new javavmwrapper it will resolve to ${LOCALBASE}/bin/java.
  Depending upon the Java VMs that are registered and various environment
  variables, it may or may not be ${LOCALBASE}/jdk1.4.2/bin/java that is
  run by javavmwrapper via the symbolic link ${LOCALBASE}/bin/java.

	/usr/lib/libopie.so.2 -> libopie.so.3
	/usr/lib/libpcap.so.2 -> libpcap.so.3

  This should have no effect unless you are using FreeBSD 5.3-BETA7 or
  higher, or if you are a -current user who upgraded after this date.
  Assuming you did a from-source upgrade new versions of these libraries
  will be created but the old versions will be left behind (for example
  /lib/libm.so.2 will be the old one, /lib/libm.so.3 will be the new one).
  Any ports or pre-built packages you have currently installed will
  continue to use the old library, any ports you install after the upgrade
  will begin to use the new library.  You will need to have all your
  ports recompiled before the old library goes away.  To help with the
  migration you could also use /etc/libmap.conf to map libm.so.2 to
  libm.so.3.

  The lanbrowsing facility of KDE has been removed from the main
  kdenetwork3 port and is now available via the net/lanbrowsing
  port.

20040901:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: tmseck@netcologne.de

  www/squid now installs an rcNG script by default. This means you
  need to explicitly enable squid by setting squid_enable=yes in
  /etc/rc.conf.
  The squid.sh script uses the following variables:
  squid_chdir
  squid_flags
  squid_user

  Please see the squid.sh script for further details.
  If you want to install an old style rc-script, build the port with
  "WITHOUT_SQUID_RCNG=YES" or by rerunning "make config" and disabling this
  option.

20040830:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kde3, x11/kdelibs3, x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@freebsd.org

  In KDE 3.3, a number of files were moved between ports and some ports
  were removed. This means that you will have to take some precautions
  to update your KDE installation. A simple portupgrade -a will not work.
  portupgrade -R kde can fail as well, depending on what parts of KDE you
  have currently installed. We therefore recommend sticking to the following
  procedure. The procedure requires you to have sysutils/portupgrade installed
  and you to be the superuser (or using sudo). We recommend not being logged in
  to a KDE session on the machine you're performing the upgrade on. If you
  choose to perform the update while being logged in to KDE, expect erratic
  behavior and crashes from applications launched during the update.

  1.) First, make sure your ports index is up to date.

      	cd /usr/ports && make index

      or, if you're using the sysutils/portindex port

      	portindex

  2.) Delete installed packages which conflict with the updated KDE
      ports.

      	pkg_deinstall -f kdeaddons-kontact-plugins-\* \
      	kdeaddons-kaddressbook-plugins-\* kdepim-\* kdeutils-\* \
      	kdeaddons-\[0-9\]\* kde-\[0-9\]\*

      kdegraphics now conflicts with the kolourpaint package and kdeedu now
      conflicts with the kwordquiz package. If you have kwordquiz and/or
      kolourpaint installed on your system and you want to use the kdegraphics/
      kdeedu ports, you should first deinstall the conflicting packages:

      	pkg_deinstall -f kolourpaint\* kwordquiz\*


  3.) Now update the remaining KDE ports.

      	portupgrade arts\* kde\* quanta\*

      or, if you want to update KDE along with other updated ports:

      	portupgrade -a

      Note that the quanta port has been renamed to kdewebdev. The commands
      above will automatically replace quanta with kdewebdev, if you have
      quanta installed.

  4.) Reinstall any KDE ports you deleted in step 2. Note that the kdeaddons-
      kontact-plugins (net/kontact-plugins), kdepim-kpilot (palm/kpilot) and
      quanta (www/quanta) ports/packages do not exist anymore and cannot be
      reinstalled.

  Known post-updating issues:

  - If you're missing acoustic notifications (system sounds) after the update:

    	rm ~/.kde/share/config/knotifyrc

    Then log out of KDE and back in again.

  - KMail has been heavily modified since KDE 3.2.x. Testing shows that KMail
    can display erratic behavior and crashes after the update. If you see any
    such behavior, it is recommended to simply close KMail and start it again
    until it resumes normal operation.

    The integration of GnuPG and KMail for signing, encrypting and verifying
    PGP/MIME mail has also changed. A quick howto is available at
    http://freebsd.kde.org/howtos/gnupg-kmail.php.

  - kdm users might get warnings from kdm about obsolete lines in kdmrc.
    You can migrate your configuration while preserving your customizations
    by running

    	genkdmconf

    Make sure to backup your old kdmrc (usually found in
    /usr/local/share/config/kdm) beforehand in case the merge produces an
    invalid configuration.

  AUTHOR: udo.schweigert@siemens.com

  The defaults of the port have been changed from WITH_MUTT_NCURSES to
  WITH_MUTT_SLANG to be in sync with the mail/mutt port. If you really have
  problems with slang (which should be a very rare case) be sure to have set
  COLORTERM=yes and COLORFGBG="color1;color2" in your environment, or recompile
  the port with the WITH_MUTT_NCURSES knob set (e.g. by adding
  WITH_MUTT_NCURSES=yes to your /etc/make.conf).

  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  japanese/ptex-tetex, japanese/xdvik, and japanese/dvipsk now
  look for the texmf.cnf file in $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf first,
  while some utilities included in the original teTeX distribution
  such as kpsepath(1) look for the file in $TEXMF/web2c/texmf.cnf
  first.  This is for separating the pTeX's texmf.cnf and
  the original TeX's texmf.cnf, and you do not have to copy or
  link the file $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf to $TEXMF/web2c/.
  To lookup pTeX path by using kpsepath(1) and so on, please
  set TEXMFCNF environment variable as described in
  $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf.  For more detail, see
  $TEXMF/web2c-ptex/texmf.cnf and $TEXMF/web2c/texmf.cnf.

  AFFECTS: users of japanese/platex209-*
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  japanese/platex209-* are renamed to japanese/platex209 and
  now depend on japanese/ptex-tetex.  While EUC-JP and JIS
  encoding can be used by default, but Shift JIS is no longer
  supported because it makes very difficult to maintain other
  pTeX related ports.  However, "ptex --kanji=sjis" still works,
  so it can be used if all of macro files under share/texmf are
  converted to Shift JIS encoding manually.

20040820:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/dvipsk-vflib
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  japanese/dvipsk-vflib has been removed because it is not maintained
  for a long time.  While japanese/dvipsk itself has no support to
  rendering vector fonts, this and Ghostscript give almost the same
  functionality.

20040820:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/xdvik-vflib

  japanese/xdvik-vflib has been renamed to japanese/xdvik because
  it has nothing to do with VFLib now.  It depends on and uses
  FreeType2 to render vector fonts.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8
  AUTHOR: tobez@FreeBSD.org, mat@FreeBSD.org, marcus@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 has been updated to 5.8.5. you should update everything
  depending on perl, that is:
    * first, upgrade your perl5.8 installation.
    * run "use.perl port", so that the system knows you have 5.8.5.
    * now, run some magic incantations to upgrade all ports depending on perl,
      that is run something like :

        | xargs -0 pkg_which -fv | sed -e '/: ?/d' -e 's/.*: //')|sort -u`
      This is likely to fail for a few ports, you'll have to upgrade them
      afterwards.
      Please note, that this last step is, strictly speaking, not necessary,
      if you are upgrading from 5.8.4.  But it is cleaner to do so anyway.

  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The update to Ant 1.6.2 introduces the following changes which may break
  older environments, according to the 1.6.2 release notes:

  . The import task used the canonical version of a file path. This
    has been changed to use the absolute path. Bugzilla 28505.
  . ant-xalan2.jar has been removed since the only class contained
    in it didn't depend on Xalan-J 2 at all. Its sole dependency has
    always been TraX and so it has been merged into ant-trax.jar.
  . All exceptions thrown by tasks are now wrapped in a buildexception
    giving the location in the buildfile of the task.
  . Nested elements for namespaced tasks and types may belong to
    the Ant default namespace as well as the task's or type's namespace.
  . <junitreport> will very likely no longer work with Xalan-J 1.

  After migrating from XFree86 to X.Org, you must rebuild
  x11-toolkits/libwnck and x11/libxklavier for full GNOME functionality
  to be restored.

  If you receive an XKB initialization error when starting GNOME, edit

  AFFECTS: users of FreeBSD-current, users of X.Org
  AUTHOR: anholt@FreeBSD.org

  The XFREE86_VERSION variable is deprecated and has been replaced by the
  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM variable. X_WINDOW_SYSTEM may be set to xorg, xfree86-4, or
  xfree86-3.  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM defaults to xorg on FreeBSD-current.  If you are
  switching to xorg, you should follow this set of commands to cleanly upgrade:

  pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/imake-4* /var/db/pkg/XFree86-*
  cd /usr/ports/x11/xorg && make install
  pkgdb -F

  Users of -stable or older -current can switch to X.Org by setting
  X_WINDOW_SYSTEM=xorg in make.conf and following the same process.

  Alternately, FreeBSD 5.x and later users can use portupgrade with packages:
    cd /var/db/pkg
    portupgrade -o devel/imake-6  imake-4*
    portupgrade -o x11/xorg-libraries  XFree86-libraries
    portupgrade -o x11/xorg-clients  XFree86-clients

  AFFECTS: users of PHP
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The old lang/php4 and lang/php5 ports have been split into 'base' PHP,
  PEAR, and shared extensions to allow more flexibility and add new features.
  Upgrading your current PHP installation will result in a 'base' PHP
  installation (no PEAR and no extensions).
  PEAR can be found in the new devel/php4-pear and devel/php5-pear ports, while
  the set of PHP extensions to install can be chosen via the meta-ports
  lang/php4-extensions and lang/php5-extensions, or installing singular
  extensions individually.
  If you have a previous php.ini configuration file, be sure to comment out
  the extension_dir parameter, since the correct path is statically compiled
  into the PHP binary.
  For an overview of the modules used with the old PHP binary, use
  the command "php -m".

  OpenLDAP version 2.2 is now the default. To upgrade all ports do
    portupgrade -rfo net/openldap22-client openldap-client
  (or a similar command for the SASL variant). If you do not want to
  upgrade, add the line `WANT_OPENLDAP_VER?=21' to /etc/make.conf

  Note that when you want to upgrade openldap21{,sasl}-server, you have
  to use slapcat/slapadd to migrate the database, since the internal
  format is not binary compatible. Simply upgrading the server without
  doing a slapcat first can corrupt your database.

  build the port with WITH_RCORDER=yes.

  Setting WITH_OPENLDAP_VER and WITH_MYSQL_VER do not automatically
  imply the corresponding WITH_ variable. The use of these options
  is discouraged, use the global settings (WANT_OPENLDAP_VER and
  DEFAULT_MYSQL_VER) to set system wide defaults.

  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The print/teTeX has been split into print/teTeX-base and print/teTeX-texmf,
  and print/teTeX is now a meta-port for the two and print/dvipsk-tetex and
  print/xdvik.  print/teTeX installs dvips and xdvi by default again (via
  print/dvipsk-tetex and print/xdvik).   For people who want to use teTeX,
  simply install print/teTeX with options set by default.

  print/teTeX-base has additional options for adding xdvi and dvips included
  in the teTeX distribution itself, but use of them are not recommended if
  you do not understand what you are trying to do.  Especially, when the
  options are set by yourself, do not install ports that match *xdvi* and
  *dvips* because they break the installed print/teTeX-base's dviware
  and such conflicts will not be detected.  In most cases, a combination
  of print/teTeX-base + print/dvipsk-tetex + print/xdvik (which are
  installed by print/teTeX by default) will be sufficient.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql-client
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  This port was removed because of dependencies problem. If you still want to
  have it, install databases/postgresql7 with -DWITHOUT_SERVER

20040521:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ircd-hybrid-ru
  AUTHOR: krion@FreeBSD.org

  UID/GID were changed from 6667 to 555, please manually delete

  If the compilation of faad fails, please manually delete older
  installed version of faad and reinstall from port.

20040512:
  AFFECTS: users of print/teTeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The print/teTeX no longer installs dvipsk by default.  To build and
  install dvipsk, you have to specify WITH_DVIPSK, or the dvipsk utility
  in the print/teTeX is also available print/dvipsk-tetex separately.
  This change is to resolve conflicts between various versions of dvips.

20040504:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/drac
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  The "drac_flags" rc.conf(5) variable has been renamed to "dracd_flags".
  See the pkg-message or script for details.

20040501:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache13
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  The apache13 port must now be enabled / disabled and configured in
  rc.conf.  See the pkg-message or script for details.

20040429:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/smartmontools
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  rc.conf.  See the pkg-message or script for details.

20040420:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The cdrecord program now uses ${PREFIX}/etc (e.g. /usr/local/etc) instead
  of /etc/default as the location of the global configuration file. If you
  created such a configuration file you need to copy it over to the new
  location.

20040420:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you update KDE from version 3.2.1 or earlier to version 3.2.2 while
  running a KDE session, newly opened instances of Konqueror might hang
  or crash, depending on how far the update has progressed.

  If this happens, it is necessary to restart your KDE session in order to
  restore proper operations.

20040404:
  AFFECTS: GNOME desktop users
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.6.  Simply portupgrading will cause serious
  problems if you are using the desktop itself.  If you are a GNOME desktop
  user, you should carefully read the instructions at:

  http://www.freebsd.org/gnome/docs/faq26.html

  And use the gnome_upgrade.sh script to properly upgrade to GNOME 2.6.  If
  you are just a casual user of some of the GNOME libraries, portupgrade
  should be sufficient to update your ports.

20040316:
  AFFECTS: users of net/isc-dhcp3-*
  AUTHOR: des@FreeBSD.org

  The isc-dhcp3-* ports must now be enabled / disabled and configured in
  rc.conf.  See the pkg-message for details.

20040313:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/expat2
  AUTHOR: marcus@FreeBSD.org

  Users of expat2 (and its many dependencies) should do the following to
  properly update expat2 and all of its dependencies:

  portupgrade -rf textproc/expat2

20040311:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql7
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  PostgreSQL 7.4.2 Released and release notes available at
  http://www.postgresql.org/news/173.html

  NOTICE: unlike most minor versions, this version does require some
  updates to the pg_* system tables. Full instructions for how to do
  this are included in the full HISTORY file.

  DO NOT UPGRADE WITHOUT READING THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

20040309:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs3 and x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  If you update kdelibs from version 3.2.0 to version 3.2.1 while running
  a KDE 3.2.0 session, newly opened instances of Konqueror will silently
  crash as soon as the new version of kdelibs has been installed, due to
  mismatching linker symbols.

  It is recommended you quit your KDE session at that point and update
  kdebase to version 3.2.1, then restart KDE.

20040309:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/arts and x11/kdebase3
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The arts port, PORTVERSION 1.2.1 does not include artswrapper anymore.
  Instead, artswrapper is now installed by a new port audio/artswrapper.

  Installation of artswrapper is optional, however:

  If you presently run KDE and you have "Run with the highest possible
  priority (realtime priority)" checked in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
  Sound System and you choose to NOT install audio/artswrapper, you need to

  - Uncheck "Run with the highest possible priority (realtime priority)"
    in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/Sound System BEFORE updating arts

  OR

  - AFTER updating arts and kdebase, go to Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
    Sound System, click on the unchecked "Run with the highest possible priority
    (realtime priority)", dismiss the message telling you that realtime is un-
    available or artswrapper is missing and then click Apply.

20040305:
  AFFECTS: users of security/antivir-milter
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  When updating from a previous version of security/antivir-milter you
  have to do the following after deinstalling the old port:
      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir
      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir.vdf
      chown root:wheel <PREFIX>/AntiVir
      chown root:smmsp <PREFIX>/AntiVir/hbedv.key
    In your SENDMAIL_MC change
      `S=unix:<PREFIX>/AntiVir/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:5m'
    to:
      `S=unix:/var/spool/avmilter/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:10m'
    and rebuild sendmail.cf.
    If /var/spool/avmilter exist you have to:
      chown -R smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/avmilter
    If you are using a customized <PREFIX>/etc/avmilter.conf the port
    won't remove it on deinstall and you have to manually change User
    and Group to smmsp there.
    Afterwards you can install the new version of this port. You then
    should run antivirupdater to get a current VDF.

20040226:
  AFFECTS: i386 users of lang/ruby* and sysutils/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: knu@FreeBSD.org

  Change the default version of ruby to 1.8 for i386.

  If you are a ruby developer and want to keep ruby 1.6 as default,
  please add RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.6 to /etc/make.conf.

  Otherwise, please run the following series of commands to migrate to
  ruby 1.8:

  1) Reinstall portupgrade manually (and as a result ruby 1.8 will be
     installed):
	pkg_delete portupgrade-\*
	(cd /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade; make install clean)

  2) Reinstall everything that depends on ruby 1.6 to use ruby 1.8
     instead:
	portupgrade -fr lang/ruby16

  3) Reinstall ruby 1.8 (because the previous step kills symlinks):
	portupgrade -f lang/ruby18

  4) Deinstall ruby 1.6 stuff (if you are paranoia):
	pkg_deinstall -ri lang/ruby16

  5) If the above commands do now work somehow and portupgrade starts
     causing LoadError, please reinstall portupgrade manually again.
     Whenever you get confused, you can always deinstall portupgrade
     and all the ruby stuff (run "pkg_delete -r ruby-\*") and
     reinstall portupgrade as a last resort.

20040204:
  AFFECTS: 5.2-CURRENT users who started with a 5.2-RELEASE or older.
  AUTHOR: obrien@FreeBSD.org

  Change the default version of perl to 5.8.

  1) Force perl-5.6.1 to be upgraded with perl-5.8.
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.8 -f perl-5.6.1_15

  2) Update all p5-* modules.
	portupgrade -f p5-\*
