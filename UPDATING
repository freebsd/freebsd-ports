This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/jasperserver
  AUTHOR: jhelfman@experts-exchange.com

  (taken from release notes of 4.0 from vendor)
  If you are upgrading from an older JasperServer version such as 3.5 then
  you must first upgrade to JasperServer 3.7 before upgrading to 4.0.
  Upgrading directly from JasperServer 3.5 to 4.0 is not a "certified"
  (i.e. fully QA tested) procedure.

  The steps to carry out this operation are fully documented in the
  JasperReports Server Installation Guide for the 3.7 release.  You will
  need to download the JasperServer 3.7 release package to get the relevant
  files and documentation. To download the JasperServer 3.7 WAR file
  distribution zip package, go to the JasperForge.org website and to the
  JasperServer project.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/ccache
  AUTHOR: Emanuel Haupt <ehaupt@FreeBSD.org>

  ccache now allows the use of non-default compilers such as clang. This
  requires adjustments of the ccache make glue.

  Please (re)read the following document after updating ccache to
  ccache-3.1.4_1:

  /usr/local/share/doc/ccache/ccache-howto-freebsd.txt

20110227:
  AFFECTS: users of net/unison and net/unison-devel
  AUTHOR:  mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.40, which uses a different wire
  protocol than 2.32 did.  In order to support synchronization with
  other computers where Unison is still at version 2.32, a new port
  net/unison232 has been created.  It provides unison232 and if that is
  GTK2-enabled, also unison232-text.  This unison232 port can be
  installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

20110224:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  Xorg has been updated to 7.5.1. For all ATI users the driver
  was updated to 6.14.0 but the old one is still available in
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati613. For the new driver you may
  need to add some stuff to your xorg.conf in the device section.

	"Section "Device""
	Option "int10" "on"
	Option "BusType" "PCIE"
	Option "RenderAccel" "on"
	Option "AccelMethod" "exa"
	Option "DynamicPM" "on"
	Option "DRI" "on"

20110224:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap24-{client,server}
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP has been upgraded to 2.4.24, which requires a shared library
  version bump.  Therefore, you need to reinstall all ports that depend on
  it.  Please do something like:

	# portupgrade -fr net/openldap24-client
  or
	# portmaster -r net/openldap24-client

20110209:
  AFFECTS: users of www/testlink
  AUTHOR: tota@FreeBSD.org

  Testlink 1.9.1 was released. Before updating, you should read carefully
  the included README file because this release requires a manual update
  of the database scheme.

20110125:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been updated to 5.12.3.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.12.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.12 from lang/perl5.{8,10} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20100715 in this file.

20110124:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  Postfix 2.8 introduces minor incompatibilities with previous versions.
  Alias expansion, dns lookups, TLS support, milters and other features
  are affected.  To avoid surprises, carefully review the RELEASE_NOTES.

  If you upgrade from Postfix 2.6 or earlier, you must execute "postfix
  stop" and "postfix start" before you can use the postscreen(8) daemon.
  This is needed because the Postfix 2.6 "pass" master service type did
  not work reliably on some systems. If you upgrade from Postfix 2.7, or
  from Postfix 2.8 before July 25, 2010, you must "postfix reload" (or
  "postfix stop" followed by "postfix start"). This is needed because
  the queue manager to delivery agent protocol has changed.

  Also note that the optional SPF and VDA patches have not been updated
  for Postfix 2.8; as a result, they are currently disabled.

20110111:
  AFFECTS: users of www/redmine
  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  If you use 3rd party plugins that are incompatible with i18n >= 0.5.0
  (eg. variables in yml files as {{variable}}) then you need to
  install an older i18n version manually.

  # gem install -v=0.4.2 i18n

  Then upgrade the database as usual:

  # rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

20110107:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim
  AUTHOR: rea@FreeBSD.org

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] The default value for system_filter_user
  is now the Exim run-time user, instead of root.

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY is no longer
  optional and is forced on.  This is mitigated by the new build
  option TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST which defines a list of configuration
  files which are trusted; one per line. If a config file is owned
  by root and matches a pathname in the list, then it may be invoked
  by the Exim build-time user without Exim relinquishing root
  privileges.

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] The Exim user is no longer automatically
  trusted to supply -D<Macro[=Value]> overrides on the command-line.
  Going forward, we recommend using TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST with shim
  configs that include the main config.  As a transition mechanism,
  we are temporarily providing a work-around: the new build option
  WHITELIST_D_MACROS provides a colon-separated list of macro names
  which may be overriden by the Exim run-time user.  The values of
  these macros are constrained to the regex ^[A-Za-z0-9_/.-]*$
  (which explicitly does allow for empty values).

  Upgrading users are encouraged to fully study
    ftp://exim.inode.at/exim/ChangeLogs/NewStuff-4.73
  and
    ftp://exim.inode.at/exim/ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-4.73

20110103:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/libwpd and graphics/libwpg
  AUTHOR: fluffy@FreeBSD.org

  LibWPD and LibWPG is now using new API, partially incompatible with
  previous versions.
  For correct upgrade procedure please upgrade LibWPD and LibWPG first
  as described, than follow usual upgrade procedure

  # portmaster -o textproc/libwpd08 libwpd
  # portmaster -o graphics/libwpg01 libwpg

  substitute 'portupgrade' for 'portmaster' accordingly if that's your
  your upgrade tool of choice.

20101230:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql??-(server|client)
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  PostgreSQL version 8.4 is now the default. To upgrade from a version
  lower than 8.4, follow the instructions on the PostgreSQL.org website.
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/interactive/install-upgrading.html

20101230:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/pnp
  AUTHOR: rea@FreeBSD.org

  Starting from 0.6.10_1 config.php is no longer preserved across
  upgrades; PNP way is to put all modifications into config_local.php.

  Existing config.php will be saved as config.php.orig and you should
  review your deviations from defaults and place them into
  config_local.php.

20101227:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-server
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  MySQL 5.5 has been updated to 5.5.8 GA release. Since layout is
  changed you should remove mysql55-{client/server/scripts} ports
  before upgrading. The build system is changed too, so expect
  failures.

20101227:
  AFFECTS: users of security/opensc
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  opensc has been updated to 0.12.0 release. Only one backend can be
  choosen at compile-time: PC/SC is now the default one.
  opensc doesn't export anymore its internal library, PKCS#11 is the
  recommended interface.

20101220:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/flowd
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  flowd use now a fix UID/GID (id 542) instead the next free UID.
  Before updating the port use the command "pw userdel _flowd"

20101216:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libksba
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  libksba has been updated to 1.1.0, and the shared library version has
  increased from .17 to .18.

  Directly- and indirectly-dependent ports have had their PORTREVISION
  bumped to facilitate rebuilding.  Please rebuild the dependent ports
  with your preferred upgrading tool:

	# portupgrade -rf security/libksba
  -or-
	# portmaster -w -r security/libksba

  If there are still ports on your system that require ksba.so.17 (either
  in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg, or non-existent), _please_ file a PR so
  that a correct direct dependency can be added.

  Once you are satisfied that no ports still depend on the old shared
  library version (libksba.so.17), you can safely delete it from the
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg directory if it is present there.

20101216:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/akonadi
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  With SQLite 3 installed, Akonadi used to build its plugin and
  install it in a wrong place, without it being listed in plist. To
  remove the orphaned file, run the following commands PRIOR TO the
  Akonadi upgrade:

  # cd /usr/ports/databases/akonadi
  # rm `make -V KDE4_PREFIX`/`make -V QT_PLUGINDIR_REL`/sqldrivers/libqsqlite3.so
  # rmdir `make -V KDE4_PREFIX`/`make -V QT_PLUGINDIR_REL`/sqldrivers \
    `make -V KDE4_PREFIX`/`make -V QT_PLUGINDIR_REL` \
    `make -V KDE4_PREFIX`/`make -V QT_LIBDIR_REL`

20101214:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/icu
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  icu has been updated to version 4.6. Please rebuild all ports that depends
  on it.

  If you use portmaster:
  # portmaster -r icu

  If you use portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -fr devel/icu

  Note that devel/icu4 is now deprecated consider replacing it by devel/icu
  # portmaster -o devel/icu devel/icu4
  or
  # env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o devel/icu -f icu-4\*

20101211:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/bugzilla, japanese/bugzilla and russian/bugzilla-ru
  AUTHOR: tota@FreeBSD.org

  Bugzilla and its language packs are installed to
  WWWDIR (defaults to PREFIX/www/bugzilla).
  BUGZILLADIR (that defaulted to PREFIX/www/data/bugzilla) is deprecated.

20101211:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql-proxy
  AUTHOR: Florian Smeets <flo@smeets.im>

  The parameters --admin-username and --admin-password are mandatory now.
  Add something like the following to rc.conf

  mysql_proxy_args="--admin-username admin --admin-password somepassword"

20101210:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/avidemux2
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 2.5.4 which now installs plugins separately
  and I had to make a slave port for them, multimedia/avidemux2-plugins.
  So you'll now have to install that port too for the app to become useful.

20101208:
  AFFECTS: autotools
  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  Another stage in the autotools cleanup that reduces tree churn whilst
  updating components, a number of ports have now moved to non-versioned
  locations since there is now only the concept of legacy and current
  versions.

  # portmaster -o devel/autoconf devel/autoconf268
  # portmaster -o devel/automake devel/automake111
  # portmaster -o devel/libtool devel/libtool22
  # portmaster -o devel/libltdl devel/libltdl22

  substitute 'portupgrade' for 'portmaster' accordingly if that's your
  your upgrade tool of choice.

20101205:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-flexget
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  Database schema changes. Please run:

	$ sqlite3 db-config.sqlite "ALTER TABLE thetvdb_favorites ADD series_id VARCHAR;"
	$ sqlite3 db-config.sqlite "ALTER TABLE imdb_movies ADD updated DateTime;"
	$ sqlite3 db-config.sqlite "ALTER TABLE imdb_movies ADD mpaa_rating VARCHAR;"

  inside flexget configuration directory (~/.flexget) for each
  sqlite database you might have.

  Replace "db-config.sqlite" with the appropriate name for your
  sqlite database file.

20101204:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/libmpcdec
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  audio/libmpcdec has been removed in favor of audio/musepack; which
  has a higher shared library version. You will have to rebuild all
  ports that depend on audio/libmpcdec. Do this:

  Portmaster users:
	# portmaster -o audio/musepack audio/libmpcdec
	# portmaster -r musepack-

  Portupgrade user:
	# env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o audio/musepack -f libmpcdec-\*
	# pkgdb -Ff
	# portupgrade -rf musepack-\*

20101204:
  AFFECTS: autotools
  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  The next stage in the ongoing cleanup of autotools-using ports is
  a refactoring of bsd.autotools.mk so that version numbers are no longer
  needed within the USE_AUTOTOOLS stanza.  There is either
  autoconf213/autoconf or automake14/automake (for the legacy versions,
  and the currently available versions).  This will considerably reduce
  the amount of tree-wide patching in future on an update.

  IMPORTANT: if you have either devel/autoconf-wrapper or
  devel/automake-wrapper installed on your system (and you most likely do)
  PLEASE update these ports to their new versions before updating anything
  else -- Bad Things[tm] are likely to happen otherwise.

20101202:
  AFFECTS: users of multmidia/gstreamer-plugins
  AUTHOR: multimedia@FreeBSD.org

  If during the upgrade of gstreamer-plugins the following error happens:
  GstAudio-0.10.gir: Incompatible version 1.0 (supported: 1.2)
  Use the following command to upgrade:

  cd ports/multimedia/gstreamer-plugins && make deinstall clean install

20101202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/wordpress
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  WordPress is now installed to WWWDIR (defaults to PREFIX/wordpress)
  instead of WORDPRESS (defaults to PREFIX/www/data/wordpress).

20101129:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/radmind
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The radmind user and group is created automatically during installation.
  The owner of $RADMIND_BASE_DIR changes from root to radmind.

20101128:
  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk, net/asterisk-addons
  AUTHOR: Florian Smeets <flo@smeets.im>

  If you want to upgrade to 1.8.0 first remove asterisk-addons by running

  # pkg_delete -f asterisk-addons\*

  after that you can run one of the following

  # portmaster asterisk
  or
  # portupgrade asterisk

  You need to update your config files as the step from 1.4.x to 1.8.x is
  quite big. First you need to look at what changed between 1.4 and 1.6

  http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.8/UPGRADE-1.6.txt

  After that you also need to take into account what chagne between
  1.6 and 1.8

  http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.8/UPGRADE.txt

  If you want to stay with asterisk 1.4.x please run

  # portmaster -o net/asterisk14 net/asterisk
  # portmaster -o net/asterisk14-addons net/asterisk-addons
  or
  # portupgrade -o net/asterisk14 net/asterisk
  # portupgrade -o net/asterisk14-addons net/asterisk-addons

20101127:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix, mail/postfix2[56]
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  As of Postfix 2.7.2, 2.6.8, 2.5.11:

  Postfix no longer automatically appends the system default CA
  (certificate authority) certificates, when it reads the CA
  certificates specified with {smtp, lmtp, smtpd}_tls_CAfile or
  with {smtp, lmtp, smtpd}_tls_CApath.  This prevents third-party
  certificates from getting mail relay permission with the
  permit_tls_all_clientcerts feature.  Unfortunately, this change
  may cause compatibility problems with configurations that rely
  on certificate verification for other purposes.  To get the old
  behavior, specify "tls_append_default_CA = yes".

20101124:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-flexget
  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  metainfo_series is no longer a builtin. This should only affect
  you if you aren't using one of the series plugins (series,
  all_series, thetvdb_favorites, or series_premiere.) If you need
  to enable metainfo_series manually for a feed it can be done like
  so:

    metainfo_series: yes

20101120:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/gtk20 and x11-toolkits/gtkmm24
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  In the GNOME 2.32 release. gdk-pixbuf2 has been split off from gtk20,
  and atkmm has been split off from gtkmm24. To upgrade please use the
  following instructions:

  Portmaster users:

    # pkg_delete -f gtkmm-2.20\* gtk-2.20\*
    # portmaster -a

  Portupgrade users:

    # pkgdb -fF
    # pkg_deinstall -fO gtkmm-2.20\* gtk-2.20\*
    # portupgrade -aOW

20101118:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs-devel
  AUTHOR: Ashish SHUKLA <ashish@FreeBSD.org>

  Due to a bug when upgrading from 24.0.50.101606, everything
  installed by other ports in "${PREFIX}/share/emacs" gets removed.

  Before upgrading:

  * Please backup custom configurations in "${PREFIX}/share/emacs".
  * After upgrading reinstall any ports that may have had files in the
    "${PREFIX}/share/emacs" directory.

  Apologies for this inconvenience.

20101117:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission-cli and net-p2p/transmission-gtk
  AUTHOR: Mezz <mezz@FreeBSD.org>

  Transmission has been updated to 2.12. The following name of binaries and
  manpages have been renamed:

	transmissioncli -> transmission-cli
	transmission -> transmission-gtk

20101117:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/ccache
  AUTHOR: Emanuel Haupt <ehaupt@FreeBSD.org>

  Updated instructions on how to workaround a buildworld failure have been
  committed. Please (re)read the following document after updating ccache to
  3.1.1_1:

  /usr/local/share/doc/ccache/ccache-howto-freebsd.txt

20101110:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-server
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  If you are upgrading from a previous MySQL release, the server will exit
  during startup after finding that the proxies_priv table is missing.
  To create the table, start the server with the --skip-grant-tables
  option to cause it to skip the normal grant table checks, then run
  mysql_upgrade. Then stop the server and restart it normally.
  You can do this by temporarly setting the following line in rc.conf:

  mysql_args="--skip-grant-tables --skip-networking"

20101108:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/py-bsddb3
  AUTHOR: wen@FreeBSD.org

  py-bsddb3 update to 5.1.0. This release drops support for Berkeley
  DB 4.1, and adds support for Berkeley DB version 5.1, brand new. If
  you need Berkeley DB 4.1 support, keep using pybsddb 5.0.0. If you
  want support for Berkeley DB 5.1, remember to install the BDB library
  before installing these bindings.

20101030:
  AFFECTS: users of www/xshttpd-devel
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  The default XS-httpd configuration file locations have changed:
  The main configuration file is now $PREFIX/etc/xshttpd/httpd.conf
  and other configuration file are stored in that same directory.
  Existing configurations should be moved over manually.
  Log files now appear in /var/log/xshttpd/ by default.

20101029:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster
  AUTHOR: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org>

  The changes to bsd.port.mk in 1.652 require all portmaster users to
  upgrade to version 3.1 or later.  The best method to do this will be
  to use the port, rather than portmaster itself:

  # pkg_delete -f portmaster\*
  # cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster && make clean && make install clean

20101026:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba35
  AUTHOR: Timur Bakeyev <timur@FreeBSD.org>

  This is the latest stable release of the Samba3 distribution. It has
  been extended with the experimental support of the NFS4-like ACLs on
  ZFS partitions, thanks to the sysutils/libsunacl library by Edward
  Tomasz Napierala(trasz). This support haven't been tested thoroughly,
  so try it on your own risk.

  This port reverted back to the pre- net/samba34 layout of the
  directories and now they are again $PREFIX/etc/samba, /var/run/samba,
  /var/log/samba, /var/db/samba and /var/spool/samba respectively.

  In case, you are upgrading from net/samba34, please rename
  corresponding samba34/ subdirectories into samba/ ones. Upgrades from
  older versions of Samba and fresh installations should be seamless.

20101015:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/llvm-devel who use clang
  AUTHOR: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

  The clang portion of devel/llvm-devel has been split out and now
  resides in lang/clang-devel.  If you have devel/llvm-devel installed
  in order to use clang, you will need to install the clang-devel port
  when upgrading.

20101003:
  AFFECTS: users of www/typo3
  AUTHOR: Helmut Schneider <jumper99@gmx.de>

  www/typo3 has been repocopied to www/typo343. If you need to continue with
  the old stable version please run

  # portmaster -o www/typo343 www/typo3
  or
  # portupgrade -o www/typo343 www/typo3

  Please remember to change the path of your config files too.

20101003:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/kismet
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  This update includes major changes in how Kismet works and is configured.
  Clients, servers, drones, and configuration files must be updated to work
  with the new version.  Map support has not yet been added.

  See the kismet README for details.

20100929:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zfsnap
  AUTHOR: Aldis Berjoza <aldis@bsdroot.lv>

  Since timestamp format changed you need to use -o option with -d
  option in order to be able to delete old snapshots. Note however that
  you don't need -o when creating new snapshots, unless you want to keep
  using the old timestamp format.

  See http://wiki.bsdroot.lv/zfsnap for more info.

20100927:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  Incompatibility with snapshot 20100912
  ======================================
  - If your DNSBL queries have a "secret" in the domain name, you must
    now censor this information from the postscreen(8) SMTP replies.
  - The postscreen "continue" action is now called "ignore". The old
    name is still supported but no longer documented.
  - The postscreen_hangup_action parameter was removed. Postscreen
    now always behaves as if "postscreen_hangup_action = drop".
  - The postscreen_cache_retention_time default was increased from
    1d to 7d, to avoid deleting results from expensive deep SMTP
    protocol tests too quickly.

  Incompatibility with snapshot 20100827
  ======================================
  - The Postfix SMTP client no longer appends the local domain when
    looking up a DNS name without ".".
    Specify "smtp_dns_resolver_options  = res_defnames" to get the old
    behavior, which may produce unexpected results.

20100924:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  nvidia-driver does not install vdpau library and headers anymore, they
  are now provided by multimedia/libvdpau port. To avoid conflict, please
  rebuild nvidia-driver port before upgrading your ports and before
  installing multimedia/libvdpau.

20100921:
  AFFECTS: users of p5-Compress-Zlib, p5-IO-Compress-*
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The p5-Compress-Zlib, p5-IO-Compress-Base, p5-IO-Compress-Zlib and
  p5-IO-Compress-Bzip2 ports have been replaced by p5-IO-Compress.
  Users of Perl 5.10 and higher do not need to install this module
  because it is already included in the standard perl distribution.

20100920:
  AFFECTS: users of security/stunnel
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  In stunnel-4.34, the DH support is no longer configurable by the user,
  but always enabled when OpenSSL supports it instead.  This means that
  it will now most probably be enabled on the supported versions of FreeBSD.
  If this leads to problems with old SSL clients, I will look into making
  it configurable at build time again.

20100917:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk
  AUTHOR: marius@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/cdrtools-cjk port has been removed, as the required functionality is
  now available in cdrtools 3.0.0 in the standard sysutils/cdrtools port.

 20100915:
  AFFECTS: autoconf, automake
  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  autoconf has been updated from 2.62 to 2.67 -- all ports depending on
  autoconf-2.62 have had their PORTREVISIONs update, so a standard
  port updating method will suffice.

  USE_GETTEXT has been extended to also accept 'build' and 'run' for
  ports which need devel/gettext as a BUILD- or RUN-time dependency only.
  No port should now be directly depending on devel/gettext in Makefiles.

20100915:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk

  Version 3.00 of sysutils/cdrtools breaks but at the same time also
  obsoletes sysutils/cdrtools-cjk as mkisofs now employs iconv for
  character conversion. Consequently sysutils/cdrtools-cjk is marked
  BROKEN and the use of USE_CDRTOOLS=cjk as well as USE_CDRTOOLS together
  with the WITH_CJK knob left in a broken state until bsd.port.mk is
  updated by portmgr@ accordingly. Once USE_CDRTOOLS is updated to no
  longer refer to sysutils/cdrtools-cjk the latter will be removed.
  Previous users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk should switch to using
  sysutils/cdrtools instead, which might require not using the WITH_CJK
  knob until said update of bsd.port.mk has happened.

  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been updated to 5.12.2.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.12.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.12 from lang/perl5.{8,10} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20100715 in this file.

  AFFECTS: ftp/curl
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  With version 7.21.1, the cURL port is built with stricter compiler
  checking by default (the -Werror flag is passed to the C compiler,
  making it treat any warnings as fatal errors).  If you experience
  problems building cURL, re-run "make config" in the ftp/curl
  directory and disable the WERROR knob.

20100818:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The default lighttpd configuration file locations have changed.
  The main configuration file is now: $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
  and includes other configuration files from $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/

  For compatibility with old-style configurations, if the lighttpd_conf
  variable is not set in /etc/rc.conf, $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd.conf takes
  precedence over $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

20100815:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis and databases/redis-devel
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The redis configuration file, redis.conf, have been changed, some options
  removed in newer versions (>=2.0).  In some cases, redis-server with

  has been removed and www/neon29's shared library version has been changed.
  You will have to rebuild all ports that depend on www/neon29. Do this:

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o www/neon29 www/neon28
	portmaster -r neon29-

  Portupgrade user:
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o www/neon29 -f neon28-\*
	pkgdb -Ff
	portupgrade -rf neon29-\*

20100728:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/nltk
  AUTHOR: clsung@FreeBSD.org

  Nltk has been upgraded to 2.0b8 which depends on devel/py-yaml now.
  You need to deinstall nltk before upgrading, since the previous port
  will delete files installed from py-yaml during its deinstall phase.

  Use, for example:

    # pkg_delete nltk-2.0b7,1
    # portsnap fetch update
    # cd /usr/ports/textproc/nltk/
    # make install clean

20100727:

  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: Phillip <pneumann@gmail.com>

  The database schema and the format in which persistent messages are
  stored have both changed since the last release (1.7.2). When
  starting, the RabbitMQ server will detect the existence of an old
  database and will move it to a backup location, before creating a
  fresh, empty database, and will log a warning.

20100715:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.10, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.12):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.12 -f perl-5.10.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.12 lang/perl5.10

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches  more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20100626:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/ibus-mozc
  AUTHOR: daichi@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/ibus-mozc port has been updated to version 0.11.383.102,
  and separated into 5 ports to cope with upcoming new port
  japanese/scim-mozc.

    o japanese/mozc-server
    o japanese/mozc-tool
    o japanese/mozc-additions
    o japanese/ibus-mozc
    o devel/py-gyp-devel

  You can not upgrade with portupgrade or portmaster. To upgrade, you
  must deinstall japanese/ibus-mozc first and then install the new
  japanese/ibus-mozc.

  For example:

    # pkg_delete ja-ibus-mozc-0.11.365.102_1
    # portsnap fetch update
    # cd /usr/ports/japanese/ibus-mozc/
    # make install clean

  AFFECTS: users of security/{dirmngr|gnupg}
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The security/libassuan port has been updated to version 2.0.0, and
  the applications listed above have been updated to use it as of versions
  1.1.0 and 2.0.15 respectively.  If you HAVE NOT updated your libassuan
  port as described in the 20100613 entry, you can simply update all 3
  ports together (libassuan, dirmngr if installed, and gnupg) using your
  normal upgrade path.  If you HAVE updated to libassuan-1, then you need
  to do the following before upgrading dirmngr and gnupg.

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o security/libassuan security/libassuan-1

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o security/libassuan libassuan-1

  If you use neither:

	pkg_delete -f libassuan*

  Please note, libassuan version 2.0.0 is now a shared library, so unlike
  the previous version it is now a runtime dependency and cannot be deleted
  after you are done building dirmngr and/or gnupg.

20100613:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kdepim4, and  security/{gpa|opensc}
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The security/libassuan port has been updated to version 2.0.0, however,
  the applications listed above are not yet compatible with it.  Therefore
  security/libassuan-1 has been created until they can be updated, and the
  ports listed above have been updated to depend on it.  You must first
  replace your existing libassuan with version 1 in the new location, then
  you can update the ports listed above normally.

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o security/libassuan-1 security/libassuan

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o security/libassuan-1 libassuan

  If you use neither:

	pkg_delete -f libassuan*

  AFFECTS: users of audio/libogg and audio/libao
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  There are new versions of libogg (1.2.0) and libao (1.0.0) and the
  shared library versions have been bumped (ogg.6 to ogg.7, ao.3 to ao.4).

  All ports that have an identifiable direct dependency on these libraries
  have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.  However, some ports that pull in
  the libraries indirectly may continue to look for the old versions.  To
  ensure that all are updated, perform this step:

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -rf libogg libao

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -r libogg libao

20100605:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/gstreamer-plugins-good and

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster gstreamer-plugins-bad

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -R multimedia/gstreamer-plugins-bad

20100602:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/mono
  AUTHOR: romain@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with Mono 2.6, the Moonlight compiler and assemblies are not
  installed by the lang/mono port anymore.  They are however provided by
  the multimedia/moonlight port.

  If you are doing some Silverlight development, install multimedia/moonlight
  after updating lang/mono.

20100530:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  Another version of gettext (0.18), and another shared library version
  bump (from intl.8 to intl.9), so:

  All ports that have an identifiable known direct dependency on gettext
  have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.  If after upgrading:

	# portupgrade -rf gettext
	# portmaster -w -r gettext

  The upgrade of devel/gobject-introspection may fail because it is looking
  for libintl.so.8.  In this case, do the following:

	# cd /usr/ports/devel/gobject-introspection
	# make clean
	# make deinstall
	# make install clean

  Then continue your upgrade procedure normally.

  If there are still ports on your system that are looking for libintl.so.8
  (either in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg, or non-existent), _please_ file
  a PR so that a correct direct dependency can be added.

  Once you are satisfied that no ports still depend on the old versions (such
  as libgettextpo.so.4 and libintl.so.8) you can safely delete them from the
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg directory if they are present there.

    - x11-wm/xmonad-contrib -> x11-wm/hs-xmonad-contrib

  Please follow these steps below to update Haskell ports that you have
  installed:

  1) Reinstall the renamed Haskell port dependencies (see previous entry).
     Note that this will possibly require that you remove the affected leaf
     (aforementioned) ports as well;

  2) Reinstall the renamed application(s) you use.

  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated from 4.3.5 to 4.4.3. A number of libraries
  was moved between packages. The recommended update procedure is to delete
  kdelibs-experimental*, kdebase-4*, kdebase-workspace-4*,
  kdebase-runtime-4*, kdepim-4*, kdepim-runtime-4*, and then update ports as
  usual and install desired KDE4 ports:

    # pkg_delete -f kdebase-\*4\* kdepim-\*4\* kdelibs-experimental-\*4\*
    # portmaster -a (or portupgrade -aR)

  In order to enabled Nepomuk semantic desktop search you have to install

  WITH_QT_PHONON global knob has been introduced to allow selection between
  multimedia/qt4-phonon* ports (a bit outdated Phonon, which is shipped with
  Qt4) and multimedia/phonon* ports.  Since KDE SC 4.4 requires fresh Phonon,
  multimedia/phonon* ports are installed by default.

  If you don't use KDE, you may set WITH_QT_PHONON=yes in /etc/make.conf
  and continue to use Qt4 Phonon implementation ports.

  If you want to use KDE SC 4.4 (or if you want the latest Phonon), do not
  define WITH_QT_PHONON, delete multimedia/qt4-phonon* ports, and install
  multimedia/phonon*:

  If you use portmaster:

  AFFECTS: users of mail/nullmailer on FreeBSD 6.X
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The nullmailer port was recently updated with an rc.d script to correctly
  daemonize nullmailer-send with daemon(8).  On FreeBSD 6.X, daemon(8) does
  not support "[-u user]" command-line switch, causing the nullmailer rc.d
  script failure to start nullmailer-send.

  Support for "[-u user]" command-line switch was recently MFC'd to 6-STABLE
 (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=bin/146266).  FreeBSD 6.X users
  should patch and install daemon(8) by one of the methods described below.

  If /usr/src is not yet populated, csup the 6-STABLE sources and run these
  commands:

    cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/daemon
    make install
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nullmailer start

  If /usr/src is already populated with sources from a previous 6.X release,
  use these commands:

    cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/daemon
    fetch 'http://people.freebsd.org/~glarkin/pr-links/daemon/patch-daemon.c'
    fetch 'http://people.freebsd.org/~glarkin/pr-links/daemon/patch-daemon.8'

  cache_log from $PREFIX/squid/logs/cache.log to /var/squid/logs/cache.log
  cache_store_log from $PREFIX/squid/logs/store.log to /var/squid/logs/store.log
  pid_filename from $PREFIX/squid/logs/squid.pid to /var/squid/logs/squid.pid
  coredump_dir from $PREFIX/squid/cache to /var/squid/cache

  Please check whether you need to define any of these variables in your
  squid.conf to the old defaults explicitly before updating, especially if
  you have set up automated log processing or automated log rotation.  If you
  define pid_filename in your squid.conf, you should also set squid_pidfile
  to the same value in /etc/rc.conf, cf. $PREFIX/etc/rc.d/squid.

  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox
  AUTHORS: beat@FreeBSD.org, mandree@FreeBSD.org (Java plugin)

  The www/firefox port has been updated to 3.6.  From now on www/firefox
  will contain the most recent version of Firefox.  Older but still
  supported releases will be available in www/firefox3 and www/firefox35.

  In order to update to Firefox 3.6 please delete your older installed
  version of Firefox first and install www/firefox afterwards.  Please
  make sure all your addons are compatible with Firefox 3.6 and backup
  your ~/.mozilla directory prior to the first launch of Firefox 3.6.

  Note that in order to use Java with Firefox 3.6, you need to install
  java/openjdk6, build it with the "WEB" option enabled and use the Iced
  Tea plugin.  To achieve the latter, each user needs to create a
  symlink to the Icedtea plugin as described in the Browsers/Firefox and
  Java[tm] Plugin section in the handbook:

	ln -s /usr/local/openjdk6/jre/lib/IcedTeaPlugin.so \
	$HOME/.mozilla/plugins

  AFFECTS: users of Mesa3D libraries and x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  If you want to use Mesa3D 7.6.1 and libdrm 2.4.17 rather than 7.4.4
  and 2.4.12, you must define WITHOUT_NOUVEAU global macro, at least,
  enabled on graphics/libGL*, graphics/libglut, graphics/dri,
  graphics/mesa-demos, and graphics/libdrm.  And please give up using
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau.

  At this time, I cannot enable latest Mesa3D and libdrm, because they
  break xf86-video-nouveau.  But old (current?) Mesa3D and libdrm do not
  break any drivers.

  AMD Radeon HD 2xxx/3xxx/4xxx users: If you use AMD Radeon HD [234]xxx
  series, please define WITHOUT_NOUVEAU global macro.  You can then use
  OpenGL Hardware Accelerator feature on these series.

20100206:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4-devel
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Default configuration file was moved to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/smb4.conf to
  avoid conflicts with the installed net/samba3?.  Also, userland utils
  are not installed by default, which should also help with the parallel
  setup of Samba3 and Samba4.

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 3 and KDE 3
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  When building qt33 and kdelibs3 (at least), while they are installed,
  because of -L/usr/local/lib being passed too soon, the currently installed
  libraries are used instead of the ones from the build.  This makes the
  build fail if you updated any of the libraries these Qt/KDE libraries are
  linked against (e.g. libjpeg).

  For the moment the workaround, when you get to this, is to move the old lib
  out of the way, e.g.:

    mv /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so.old && \
    cd /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/qt33/ && make && \
    mv /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so.old /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so && \
    portmaster -C x11-toolkits/qt33 (or portupgrade -w qt-33\*) ...

  Default version of Perl was bumped to 5.10.

  If you already have lang/perl5.8 installed, and want to switch to
  lang/perl5.10 please follow instructions in the entry 20090328 in this
  file.

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba34
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  This port was developed with the generous help of Florent Brodin.

  The default passdb backend has been changed to `tdbsam'! That breaks
  existing setups using the `smbpasswd' backend without explicit
  declaration! Please use `passdb backend = smbpasswd' if you would like
  to stick to the `smbpasswd' backend or convert your smbpasswd entries
  using e.g. `pdbedit -i smbpasswd -e tdbsam'.

  The `tdbsam' backend is much more flexible concerning per user
  settings like `profile path' or `home directory' and there are some
  commands which do not work with the `smbpasswd' backend at all.

20100130:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/sdl_mixer and graphics/sdl_image
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The SDL_mixer and SDL_image libraries have new shared library versions.
  Please rebuild all ports that depend on them.

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -r sdl_mixer-
	portmaster -r sdl_image-

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -fr audio/sdl_mixer
	portupgrade -fr graphics/sdl_image

20100125:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/openal and graphics/openal-soft
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The default OpenAL implementation was switched to audio/openal-soft.
  To update all ports correctly, the following steps have to be performed.

	pkg_delete -f openal-\*

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o audio/openal-soft audio/openal
	portmaster -r audio/openal-soft

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -ro audio/openal audio/openal-soft

  If you want to stick with audio/openal, please specify the following ports
  make flag within /etc/make.conf (or an appropriate configuration file for
  your ports):

	WANT_OPENAL=si

20100122:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/policykit and sysutils/polkit
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Due to a recent change in sysutils/policykit, both sysutils/policykit,
  and sysutils/polkit need to be rebuilt, but in a certain order.  First,
  upgrade sysutils/policykit to 0.9_6.  Then, force rebuild and reinstall
  of sysutils/polkit.  If you do not do this, applications which depend
  on polkitd will fail.

20100113:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  Port has been renamed to emulators/virtualbox-ose to reflect that we are
  using the OSE version.  A separate port for the kernel modules has been
  created: emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod.

  Please see http://wiki.freebsd.org/VirtualBox for update instructions.

20100107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  security/openvpn has been moved to security/openvpn20 and upgraded to 2.0.9.
  security/openvpn has been upgraded to 2.1.1, and security/openvpn-devel has
  been removed.

  Regular upgrades of the security/openvpn port should succeed without
  manual intervention, but if you want to stick to openvpn 2.0 or if you
  had been using openvpn-devel, manual intervention is needed, as
  follows:

  If you'd been using the security/openvpn-devel port, please use one of
  these commands for upgrading:

    portmaster -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn security/openvpn-devel

    portupgrade -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn security/openvpn-devel

  If you want to stick to openvpn 2.0, please use one of these two
  upgrade commands:

    portmaster -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn20 security/openvpn

    portupgrade -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn20 security/openvpn

20100106:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/websvn
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default install directory for websvn has changed from
  ${PREFIX}/www/data/websvn to ${PREFIX}/www/websvn.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your settings
  and data, please do the following:

	mv /usr/local/www/data/websvn /usr/local/www

  Then update as usual.

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/grok
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  The sysutils/grok port has been completely re-written. Configuration files
  will need to be reviewed. Also, the RC script has been removed until it can
  be made to work with the new version.

20091226:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/ndoutils
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading you'll need to run ./upgradedb; see UPGRADING file.

20091214:
  AFFECTS: users of net/grdc
  AUTHOR: avl@FreeBSD.org

  Grdc has been renamed to Remmina upstream, and the port was also renamed
  to reflect this.  After installing remmina port you will need to download
  the ``grdc2remmina.sh'' script and run it as your normal user(s) that
  have ~/.grdc.  The script will only create ~/.remmina directory and move
  grdc config files to the new path; it does not affect anything else.

	$ fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~avl/script/grdc2remmina.sh
	$ sh grdc2remmina.sh

20091213:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/zabbix, net-mgmt/zabbix-agent
  AUTHOR: Jim Riggs <ports@christianserving.org>

  In order to simplify configuration and better separate the different
  components of Zabbix, the former zabbix port has been split into three:
  zabbix-server, zabbix-proxy, and zabbix-frontend.  Each component has
  distinct functionality and may be installed independently on separate
  systems.  The existing zabbix-agent port remains.

  Additionally, the new zabbix-frontend port now (correctly) installs the
  PHP frontend in PREFIX/www/zabbix.  The old zabbix port installed the
  files in PREFIX/share/zabbix/php.  Web server configurations must be
  updated accordingly.

  Finally, Zabbix has been updated to version 1.8.  Not everyone may be
  able to upgrade from version 1.6 immediately, though, so 1.6.8 versions
  of the ports are also available as zabbix16-server, zabbix16-proxy,
  zabbix16-agent, and zabbix16-frontend.

20091206:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 0.11.1, which no longer enables kqemu by
  default (if built with KQEMU knob on), now you also have to explicitly
  pass -enable-kqemu (or -kernel-kqemu as with the previous versions)
  if you want to use it.  Also note the 0.11 stable branch is the last
  qemu branch that still supports kqemu, so if you depend on reasonably
  fast emulation on FreeBSD you should start looking for alternatives
  some time soon.  (VirtualBox?)

20091120:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfixadmin
  AUTHOR: Terry Sposato <tabmow@freenode.net>

  Due to a bug in the previous postfixadmin port, existing users need to
  backup their config.inc.php before they upgrade to postfixadmin-2.3 or
  later and put it in place after the upgrade is complete.

20091120:
  AFFECTS: users of security/f-prot
  AUTHOR: Tim Bishop <tdb@FreeBSD.org>

  The main f-prot command is now named fpscan.  Virus definitions are
  updated using the fpupdate command.  fpupdate will automatically run
  from periodic every day.  To disable set the following option in
  /etc/periodic.conf:

	fpupdate_enable="NO"

  The f-prot port now only works on i386.

20091118:
  AFFECTS: users of java/jboss5
  AUTHOR: Jonathan Chen <jonc@chen.org.nz>

  The JBoss directory structure has been reorganised to follow hier(7)
  guidelines more closely; in particular, transient and deployment files
  were moved to /var/jboss5, thus allowing /usr to be read-only.

20091118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/redmine
  AUTHOR: Bernhard Froehlich <decke@bluelife.at>

  After the upgrade you need to generate a session secret before restarting
  the application.  This is to protect you from cross-site request forgery.
  From your Redmine directory, simply run the following command once:

	# rake config/initializers/session_store.rb

  then upgrade as usual:

	# rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

20091114:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/win4bsd
  AUTHOR: Mario S F Ferreira <lioux@FreeBSD.org>

  The new port now depends on emulators/kqemu-kmod instead of installing
  its own version.  Therefore, you should make sure that no other kqemu.ko
  modules are installed:

	# pkg_delete -f win4bsd\*
  	# rm -f /boot/kernel/kqemu.ko
  	# pkg_delete -f kqemu-kmod\*
  	# portinstall emulators/win4bsd

  Do not forget to enable kqemu on rc.conf since win4bsd will not work
  without it.

20091018:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql54-server
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  After the upgrade the server may fail to start due to changes in the
  default values of innodb_log_files_in_group and innodb_log_file_size,
  which differ from those in earlier 5.4 releases.

  You should discard the old InnoDB log files and let MySQL 5.4.3 create
  new ones.  It is necessary to shut down your current server cleanly so
  that no outstanding transaction information remains in the log.

  See here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.4/en/news-5-4-3.html

  AFFECTS: users of mail/heirloom-mailx
  AUTHOR: Alexander Logvinov <avl@FreeBSD.org>

  Since SourceForge switched to the new File Release System,
  mail/heirloom-mailx has wrong package name.  All users who have
  mail/heirloom-mailx installed after 22 August 2009 should run the
  following commands:

	# pkg_delete "\-mailx-12.4_1"
  or
	# rm -r /var/db/pkg/-mailx-12.4_1

	# rm -r /var/db/ports/-mailx

  AFFECTS: users of archivers/lzmautils, archivers/lzmautils-devel
  AUTHOR: Christian Weisgerber <naddy@FreeBSD.org>

  The XZ Utils distribution has superseded LZMA Utils, so the xz port has
  been added and the lzmautils ports have been removed.  To perform the
  move, run one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:

	# portupgrade -o archivers/xz lzmautils\*

  If using portmaster:

	# portmaster -o archivers/xz archivers/lzmautils
  or
	# portmaster -o archivers/xz archivers/lzmautils-devel

  as applicable.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-postfwd
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@tandon.net>

  The recipient rate-limiting feature is now called via rcpt() command
  instead of with mrcpt() as in previous versions.  Make sure to update
  your postfwd.conf if you use this feature.

  AFFECTS: users of www/epiphany, x11/yelp, graphics/librsvg2,
	   x11/toolkits/py-gnome-extras, and www/epiphany-extensions
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The default Gecko provider has been changed from www/firefox to
  www/libxul.  Firefox 2.x is now marked FORBIDDEN for security reasons,
  and libxul is new, stable, and preferred Gecko provider.  Libxul uses
  the same Gecko engine as Firefox 3.0.x.

  Some ports may fail to upgrade or run when both www/firefox and libxul
  are installed on the same system.  To make sure everything runs smoothly,
  uninstall www/firefox, then install libxul, then upgrade the affected
  ports.

20090915:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/gosa
  AUTHOR: Denis Shaposhnikov <dsh@wizard.volgograd.ru>

  Please read the following:

    https://oss.gonicus.de/labs/gosa/wiki/DocumentationInstallingUpdatingGOsa

  before upgrading this port.  And don't forget to check your slapd.conf
  because gosa scheme files were changed.  Should you have any problems
  during LDAP migration step, try to restart your PHP process.

20090911:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.10
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.10 has been updated to 5.10.1.  You should update everything

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon*, x11/kdebase4*, deskutils/kdepim4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE4 has been updated to version 4.3.0.  KDE now uses qt4-phonon;
  multimedia/phonon and multimedia/phonon-gstreamer are deprecated in
  favor of their qt4 equivalents.  You can still use multimedia/phonon-xine
  however.  A number of files have been moved between packages.  The
  recommended update procedure is to delete phonon, phonon-gstreamer,
  kdebase-*4*, kdepim-4*, then update ports as usual and install desired
  KDE4 ports:

    # pkg_delete -f phonon-4\* phonon-gstreamer\* kdebase-\*4\* kdepim-4\*
    # portmaster -a (or portupgrade -a)
    # cd ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde4 && make config && make install clean

  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/libtool15 and devel/libltdl15 ports have been moved to libtool22
  and libltdl22, respectively, then updated to 2.2.6a. You will need to run
  portmaster or portupgrade to properly perform the upgrade:

  If using portmaster:

	portmaster -o devel/libtool22 devel/libtool15
	portmaster -o devel/libltdl22 devel/libltdl15

  If using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o devel/libtool22 libtool-1.5\*
	portupgrade -o devel/libltdl22 libltdl-1.5\*

  After that, you will need to rebuild all ports that depend on libltdl.
  Since all dependent ports' PORTREVISIONs have been bumped, you can run
  portupgrade or portmaster with `-a' option to complete the upgrade.

20090801:

  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Most applications and plugins should run unaltered on Catalyst 5.80.

  However, a lot of refactoring work has taken place, and several changes
  have been made which could cause incompatibilities. If your application
  or plugin is using deprecated code, or relying on side effects, then you
  could have issues upgrading to this release.

  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  The GID of virtualbox has changed due to a conflict with databases/couchdb.
  Update GID of vboxusers after updating the port:

	# pw groupmod vboxusers -g 920

  AFFECTS: users of math/fftw3 math/fftw3-long math/fftw3-float
  AUTHOR: db@FreeBSD.org

  The Fortran option has removed from fftw3 and moved into slave ports,
  math/fftw3-fortran math/fftw3-long-fortran and math/fftw3-float-fortran.

20090615:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/enlightenment and x11-wm/enlightenment-devel
  AUTHOR: gahr@FreeBSD.org

  The development version of the Enlightenment window manager, a.k.a. E17,
  was moved from x11-wm/enlightenment-devel to x11-wm/enlightenment.  The
  DR16 branch now resides in x11-wm/e16.

20090615:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mlt++
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  The multimedia/mlt++ port was incorporated into multimedia/mlt since
  version 0.4.2.  Delete multimedia/mlt++ first and then install/update
  multimedia/mlt.

20090613:
  AFFECTS: users of www/hudson
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  Hudson is now running as a standalone process and no longer relies on
  Apache Tomcat.  As such, it should now be configured by defining
  hudson_* variables in rc.conf.  See comments from rc.d script for further
  details.

  The default setup is using the same port numbers and HTTP URL prefix as
  before in order to reduce the effort of upgrading the port.  Hence, it
  may conflict with some running Apache Tomcat instance.  To fix this
  problem, you may either deinstall www/tomcat6, or use the following
  settings in hudson_args from /etc/rc.conf:

    --httpPort=??? --ajp13Port=???

20090611:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Two rc.d scripts have been renamed:

	apache22.sh -> apache22
	htcacheclean.sh -> htcacheclean

  You'll need to update any crons wrappers, etc. for the new paths.

20090608:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python* and py-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Python has been changed from 2.5.x to 2.6.x.
  If you have 2.5.x installed, perform an upgrade of lang/python25 to
  lang/python26 with one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python26 lang/python25

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python26 lang/python25

  If you want to retain 2.5.x as default Python version, set the
  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION variable to 'python2.5' (without quotes) in
  /etc/make.conf, then go to lang/python and perform the following
  command:

  # portupgrade -R python

  Once the installed Python has been updated to 2.6, by using the
  method above, it is required to run the upgrade-site-packages target in
  lang/python to assure that site-packages are made available to the new
  Python version.

  If using portupgrade:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  If using portmaster:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages -DUSE_PORTMASTER

  The portmaster case can take quite some time to complete due to the lack of
  cached information that the portupgrade suite uses (specifically pkg_which).
  This is not the fault of portmaster.

20090606:
  AFFECTS: users of java/eclipse
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The update to 3.4.2 changes the location of the metadata for eclipse to
  be more in line with what is used on other platforms.  This means that
  after the update plugins that have been installed by a user with the
  built in Update Manager will need to be reinstalled.

20090605:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  Version 2.6.1 introduced a POLA violation by expecting aliases.db to be
  in /etc/mail/aliases.db (not /etc/aliases.db).  With this version the
  location is reverted to the right place.

  If you updated your installation to 2.6.1 you need to run newaliases(1)
  again after you installed 2.6.2.

20090603:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/font-mplus-ipa (and old japanese/ipa-ttfonts)
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  IPAUIGothic has been updated to a version included in IPA font
  version 002.03 and added as a separated port
  "japanese/font-ipa-uigothic".  And the font-mplus-ipa has been
  updated to remove the old IPAUIGothic.

  Thus the old ipa-ttfonts is almost equivalent to font-ipa +
  font-ipa-uigothic + font-mplus-ipa.  Note that these three packages
  have different licenses from each other.

20090601:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/cvs-devel
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  cvs-devel no longer installs /bin/cvs and /bin/cvsbug. These are now
  installed into ${PREFIX}/bin. If you wish to use these please be aware
  of this change with respect to your path.

20090531:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/viewvc
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  viewvc.conf and templates are not compatible to 1.0.x version, even the
  database scripts have changed.  For details see:

  http://viewvc.tigris.org/source/browse/*checkout*/viewvc/trunk/docs/upgrading-howto.html

20090530:
  AFFECTS: users of Japanese and Chinese fonts
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Ports for Japanese fonts have been reorganized in the following way:

	japanese/ipa-ttfonts -> japanese/font-mplus-ipa
	japanese/ipa-ttfonts -> japanese/font-ipa
	japanese/kochi-ttfonts -> japanese/font-kochi
	japanese/mplusfonts -> japanese/font-mplus
	japanese/sazanami-ttf -> japanese/font-sazanami
	japanese/shinonome -> japanese/font-shinonome
	japanese/umefont -> japanese/font-ume
	japanese/vlgothic -> japanese/font-vlgothic

  While basically these are port name changes for consistency,
  installation directories are also changed:

	font files -> ${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}/*
	symlinks -> ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/{TTF,OTF,fontname,...}/*
	symlinks -> ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/{TTF,OTF,misc,fontname,...}/*

  A user-visible one is that the directory name "TrueType" is replaced
  with "TTF".

  Also, japanese/font-std and chinese/font-std have been added as
  standard fonts used in the Ports Collection.  Currently they
  contain:

	std.ja_JP/Mincho
	std.ja_JP/Gothic
	std.ja_JP/Ryumin-Light
	std.ja_JP/GothicBBB-Medium
	std.zh_CN/STHeiti-Regular
	std.zh_CN/STSong-Light
	std.zh_CN/MSung-Light
	std.zh_CN/MHei-Medium

  under ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/.  They are just symlinks to
  corresponding font files.  The symlink names are based on popular
  PostScript font names.

  Applications should refer the font files via XLFD or fontconfig
  first.  If they need a direct reference to the font file, please use
  files in std.*/*.  This is because direct reference to a specific
  font name in an application configuration file makes the maintenance
  difficult when the font file name is changed, for example.

20090516:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/viewvc
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  OPTION APACHE2 has been changed to APACHE (WITH_APACHE)
  WITH_APACHE2 is deprecated and is being removed.
  APACHE_PORT will be pulled in when WITH_APACHE is selected

20090516:
  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-base and portupgrade
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The print/cups port has been split into multiple ports.  If upgrading
  from 1.3.10_1 and below, you must remove the installed version first.

20090412:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bacula-server
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/bacula-server now uses a new catalog format.  If upgrading
  from the old version please use the update_bacula_tables script
  provided with the port before restarting bacula.

20090410:
  AFFECTS: users of www/trac-email2trac
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  bin/email2trac.py and bin/delete_spam.py are now installed without the
  .py extension to make the suid run_email2trac work and match the online
  documentation.  If you were using them in scripts or alias entries, you
  will need to update paths accordingly.

20090401:
  AFFECTS: users of Fedora 8 Linux infrastructure ports
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  ATTENTION! Those ports are not default for any version of FreeBSD for now
  and may be used with FreeBSD versions 7.2 and above (8-CURRENT is better)
  using compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 and linux_base-f8. Please, note that
  2.6.16 is not fully supported on 7.x (ex., some syscalls are missing
  and cannot be MFCed due to a native FreeBSD ABI breakage).

  For more information about transition please read item "20070327: AFFECTS:
  users of emulators/linux_base-fc6". That note may be used for upgrading
  to linux_base-f8 and Fedora 8 Linux infrastructure ports as well.

  If you want to switch to linux-f8 ports, please define at /etc/make.conf:

	OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f8
	OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f8

20090328:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.10 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.8, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.10):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.10 -f perl-5.8.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portmaster -o lang/perl5.10 lang/perl5.8
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches  more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20090327:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  After version 0.95 clamav-milter does not accept parameters by command
  line.  If you are using $clamav_milter_flags on rc.conf to set its
  parameters you will need to move to new ${PREFIX}/etc/clamav-milter.conf.

20090319:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash3
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  With the addition of shells/bash version 4.x, people wanting to stick
  with bash 3.x should perform the following update:

	$ portupgrade -f -o shells/bash3 bash

20090318:
  AFFECTS: users of www/suphp
  AUTHOR: yzlin@cs.nctu.edu.tw

  The suPHP port has been upgraded to 0.7.x. This new version of suPHP has
  some new features and changes for the configuration file:

    - Multiple path (with patterns) & variable substitution support for
      docroots
    - Double-quoted strings at section '[handlers]'
      ex. application/x-httpd-php="php:/usr/local/bin/php-cgi"

  These changes may lead to internal server error if without modifications
  of the configuration file from previous version.

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of www/geeklog
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  To follow the standards this port has received a small reworking.

  WWW_DIR (that defaulted to PREFIX/www/data/geeklog) is deprecated,
  use WWWDIR (defaults to PREFIX/www/geeklog).

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: skylord@linkline.ru

  ejabberd's UID and GID have changed (PR ports/105122). Users are advised
  to check all configuration files and data in /var/spool/ejabberd to
  ensure everything has the correct owner/group.

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/lire
  AUTHOR: edwin@FreeBSD.org

  Lire now requires DBD::SQLite, which uses SQLite 3.0.  This means that the
  Lire database format has changed.  If you have one or more old Lire stores,
  you will need to convert each of them from SQLite2 format to SQLite3 like
  this:

	$ sqlite oldstore.db .dump | sqlite3 newstore.db

  This assumes that you have both SQLite2 and SQLite3 installed on your
  system, and that the names of the command line interface for the old and
  new version are `sqlite' and `sqlite3' respectively (this is at least
  correct for Fedora).

20090310:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mythtv
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The upgrade from version 0.20 to version 0.21 should be transparent.
  Any changes to the database structure should be applied automatically.

  However, it is strongly recommended that you back up your database before
  installing a new version of MythTV.

  For example:

	$ mysqldump -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -c > mythtv_backup.sql

  To restore (assuming that you've dropped the database):

	$ mysql -u root
	mysql>create database mythconverg;
	mysql>exit
	$ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < mythtv_backup.sql

20090309:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libusb on CURRENT
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  FreeBSD libusb20 was renamed to libusb in r189585 and thus, being fully
  compatible with libusb20, replaces devel/libusb on HEAD.  devel/libusb
  should not be used on these systems.  Users of libusb-dependent ports
  are advised to remove libusb package from their systems, and rebuild all
  libusb dependencies.  One of the possible ways to achieve this is
  listed below:

	# set tempfile=`mktemp /tmp/usbports.XX`
	# pkg_info -qR /var/db/pkg/libusb-* > ${tempfile}
	# pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/libusb-*
	# cat ${tempfile} | xargs portupgrade -f
	# rm -f ${tempfile}

20090309:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/phonon port has been split into phonon itself, phonon-xine,
  and phonon-gstreamer backends.  After updating phonon port you have
  to install at least one backend; phonon-xine backend is recommended
  for KDE.

20090308:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 0.10.0, which now uses the newer
  (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade emulators/qemu
  with the KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20090304:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/py-gammu
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  The port comms/py-gammu was incorporated into comms/gammu since
  1.23.0. Delete comms/py-gammu first and then deinstall/reinstall
  comms/gammu with option WITH_PYTHON_GAMMU=YES.

20090304:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xfce4
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading from Xfce 4.4 to 4.6 make sure you uninstall the following
  ports:

	x11/libxfce4mcs
	sysutils/xfce4-mcs-manager
	sysutils/xfce4-mcs-plugins
	x11-themes/xfce4-icon-theme

  You may uninstall them before you start the upgrade procedure (preferred)
  or even afterwards when the upgrade went fine.

  Please also note that Xfce 4.6 does not come with an icon theme any more.
  Xfce 4.6 now depends on the Tango theme which is now installed by default.
  The default installation of Xfce is also adjusted to use this icon theme
  instead of the Xfce 4.4 standard Rodent theme.  If you are upgrading from
  Xfce 4.4 to 4.6 you probably still have the Rodent theme selected.  This
  will lead to several "missing" icons when starting up Xfce.

  Make sure to switch as well to the Tango theme.  To do this just open the
  Settings Manager and select Appearance.  Inside the Appearance dialog
  switch to the Icons tab and select the "Tango" entry in the list on the
  left side of the Icons tab.

  For enabling the Reboot/Shutdown functionality of Xfce's logout dialog
  please read the note which gets printed out after the installation of
  x11-wm/xfce4 about how to configure PolicyKit.

20090223:
  AFFECTS: users of Tcl/Tk
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Tcl/Tk has been changed from 8.4 to 8.5.

  To restore old behavior and prefer using Tcl 8.4 with supported ports set
  WITH_TCL_VER=84 in /etc/make.conf. This has no effect on ports that have
  USE_TCL=yes or USE_TK=yes. They stick to the new default version and have
  to be updated by their maintainers to support other versions than default.

20090218:
  AFFECTS: users of www/zend-framework
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was fixed in Zend Framework
  1.7.5. The LFI was present in the Zend_View::render() method, and
  allowed inclusion of scripts with relative path names, e.g.
  "../../../my/script/dir/myscript.php".

  If the script path name is hard-coded into the application and is not
  generated by user input, the vulnerability does not apply.  Because of
  this exception, the Zend Framework team has added a flag to disable
  the LFI protection in the render() method.

  Full details of the vulnerability, whether it applies to your
  application and how to disable the LFI protection in the render()
  method can be found here:

  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap24-{client,server}
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP has been upgraded to 2.4.14, which requires a shared library

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon, x11/kdelibs4, x11/kdebase4*,
  deskutils/kdepimlib4, deskutils/kdepim4, devel/automoc4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE4 has been updated from 4.1.4 to 4.2.0.  A number of applications
  have been moved between packages.  The easiest way to avoid various
  problems during update is to delete all KDE-4.1.4 ports and install
  KDE-4.2.0:

	# pkg_delete -f kde\*4.1.4\* automoc4-\*
	# portmaster -a (or portupgrade -a)
	# cd ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde4 && make config && make install clean

20090207:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libslang and devel/libslang2
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  devel/libslang has been removed in favor of devel/libslang2 after not
  being released during last five years.  WITH_SLANG2 is no longer a
  valid ports KNOB.  All ports that depend on devel/libslang should be
  recompiled, e.g.:

	# portupgrade -o devel/libslang2 devel/libslang

  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server, sysutils/hal
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/hal has been updated and should now properly detect mice for
  in X.Org.  Use of AllowEmptyInput should no longer be needed for most
  users and moused should now work fine.

20090123:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  If you are using an older xorg.conf several config lines are no longer
  needed and will generate warnings when X is started.  RgbPath will cause
  X to fail to start, remove it from your config.

  Server 1.5.3 also really wants to configure its input devices via hald.
  This is causing some issues with moused and /dev/sysmouse.  There are
  couple of options for how to deal with it:

  1. Add Option "AllowEmptyInput" "off" to your ServerLayout section.
     This will cause X to use the configured kbd, mouse, and vmmouse
     sections from your xorg.conf

  2. Don't use moused.  If you want it to work with addon USB mice
     set this in rc.conf:

	moused_enable="NO"
	moused_nondefault_enable="NO"

  I'm working on fixing hald or the mouse driver or both.

20090123:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/libxcb
  AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  Libxcb shared library version was bumped from 1 to 2.  You need to
  rebuild any consumer of libxcb.so.1 or some applications will be
  linked against two versions of libxcb once libX11 is upgraded.

  For portupgrade users:

	# portupgrade -rf libxcb

20090121:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/linux-glib2, emulation/linux_base-f4
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  Glib2 now is incorporated to emulation/linux_base-fc4 (it has always

20090119:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/claws-mail, mail/claws-mail-smime
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The claws-mail port includes the S/MIME plugin itself now, it is not
  distributed as a separate plugin anymore. It can be enabled with the
  GPGME option in the port (disabled by default). If you use the S/MIME
  plugin, you should remove the mail/claws-mail-smime port before
  enabling GPGME and updating the mail/claws-mail port. People which
  already updated mail/claws-mail with GPGME enabled and a non-working
  S/MIME plugin need to deinstall mail/claws-mail-smime and reinstall
  mail/claws-mail.

20090118:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Deluge has been updated from 0.5.x to 1.x. The 1.x has been rewritten,
  so it is recommend for you to make the back up of your ~/.config/deluge. The
  configuration and plugins of 0.5.x do not work in 1.x. Deluge will picking
  up the old configuration and try to convert it to the newer format, but I
  wouldn't trust it to do it without the back up.

  If you prefer to stick with 0.5.x, you can use portmaster:

  	# portmaster -o net-p2p/deluge05 net-p2p/deluge

  or if you use portupgrade:

	# portupgrade -o net-p2p/deluge05 net-p2p/deluge

  AFFECTS: users of GNOME and GTK+
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.24.x.  You have to deinstall a few ports
  first before using portupgrade or portmaster in order to successfully
  upgrade your GNOME installation.  After successful upgrade, you have
  to reinstall gnome-session so the gnome.desktop session file is properly
  installed.

  Portupgrade users:

	# pkgdb -Ff

  perl-after-upgrade script supplied with lang/perl5.8.  Please see its
  manual page for details.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/claws-mail*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  claws-mail has been updated to 3.7.0, with this update OpenSSL support
  has been removed by upstream in favour of GnuTLS.  GnuTLS is now enabled
  by default.  Themes were have also been split to an extra port which
  your can find under x11-themes/claws-mail-themes.  Menu was rewritten
  entirely in version 3.6.0 using modern GTK interface; as a consequence,
  all your custom shortcuts will be lost after upgrade.

20090109:
  AFFECTS: users of any Mozilla and Opera products
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Java plugins now will no longer be picked up by automatically from
  these browsers.  Because all Java ports share the name of plugins file,
  I am thinking about someone or maybe me will need to write something
  similar to nspluginwrapper (but in shell script) that can add Java plugin
  in ~/.*/plugins/ when user requests one specific version of Java plugin
  if this user has more than one version of Java installed.  However, for
  now, you will have to add Java plugin in ~/.*/plugins/ manually.

20090107:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/unixODBC
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/unixODBC port has been updated to 2.2.14.  While
  containing many bug fixes and minor feature adjustments, this version
  no longer ships with the (obsolete) MySQL ODBC driver.  MySQL ODBC
  driver users will probably want to use databases/mysql-connector-odbc
  instead.  The text-backed/flatfile driver (libtxtodbc) has also been
  removed by the developers but due to some demand may make a return in
  a future version or as a separate port.

20090107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libgcrypt
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  libgcrypt has been upgraded to 1.4.3 which has a shared library version
  bump.  You need to reinstall all ports that depend on it.  Use something
  like this:

	portupgrade -rf libgcrypt
	portmaster -r libgcrypt

20090104:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap24-{client,server}
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP has been upgraded to 2.4.13, which requires a shared library
  version bump.  Therefore, you need to reinstall all ports  that depend on
  it.  Please do something like:

	# portupgrade -fr net/openldap24-client

20081230:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: pneumann@gmail.com

  The database schema has changed between RabbitMQ-1.4.0 and this release.
  When the RabbitMQ server detects the presence of an old database, it
  moves it to a backup location, creates a fresh, empty database, and
  logs a warning.

20081226:
  AFFECTS: users of www/rt38
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/rt38 now respects the FreeBSD directory layout, see hier(7).
  With this change, p5-RT-* and p5-RTx-* should be much simpler to use
  in the ports collection.

  Please note that www/p5-RTx-Shredder is included in www/rt38.  This
  port will be deprecated and removed.

20081228:
  AFFECTS: users of astro/boinc-setiathome-enhanced
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  The setiathome client has been updated to version 6.03 and version 5.00
  of the astropulse client has been added.  Before you update, finish and
  report your current workunits to avoid losing them.  The port now also
  includes the client screensavers.

20081228:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/kinput2
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The Wnn backend of japanese/kinput2 port now uses unix domain socket
  to communicate the server by default.  If $JSERVER environment
  variable is defined, the value is used as the server host name.  In
  In short, the server name is determined in the following way:

  $JSERVER --(if null)--> CcWnn.Jserver --(if null)--> "localhost"

  If the server host name is null or matches "^unix$", unix domain
  socket is used.  Note that the default server name in CcWnn.Jserver
  is "unix" now.

20081226:
  AFFECTS: users of www/rt*
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/rt2 www/rt3 www/rt32 www/rt34 are now deprecated and will expire
  2009-02-01.  All ports now depend on www/rt38 If you can not update
  to www/rt38, www/rt36 is still around.

20081224:
  AFFECTS: users of www/phpSysInfo
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The www/phpSysInfo port has been split into www/phpsysinfo and
  www/phpsysinfo-dev ports.

20081217:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/policyd2
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  The RC script for mail/policyd2 has been renamed to avoid a conflict.
  If you use this port please change the setting in rc.conf to be
  policyd2_enable.

20081211:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5
  AUTHOR: pav@FreeBSD.org, itetcu@FreeBSD.org, ale@FreeBSD.org

  As of PHP 5.2.7, pcre extension is distributed with the core PHP5 package,
  and not as a standalone module anymore.  Follow the steps below to update
  your installation.

  Portupgrade users:

	pkg_delete -f php5-pcre-5.2.6
	pkgdb -F
	portupgrade as usual

  Portmaster users:

	pkg_delete -f php5-pcre\*
	portmaster php5

  If you are using pecl ports you might need to force an update on them:

	portupgrade -f pecl\*
  or
	portmaster pecl

  If you have the pecl hash, json and/or zip extensions you need to replace
  them with the PHP5 bundled ones, e.g.:

	portmaster/portupgrade -o archivers/php5-zip archivers/pecl-zip
	portmaster/portupgrade -o devel/php5-json devel/pecl-json
	portmaster/portupgrade -o security/php5-hash security/pecl-hash

  If you build your INDEX locally and you tried to build it after the PHP
  update commit, you need to rebuild it _after_ you updated lang/php5:

	cd /usr/ports && make index

  or (if you use ports-mgmt/p5-FreeBSD-Portindex):

	cd /usr/ports && cache-init && portindex -o `make -V INDEXFILE`

20081207:
  AFFECTS: users of games/mkgichessclub
  AUTHOR: nivit@FreeBSD.org

  with the command:

	mysql _mkgichessclub_ < /usr/local/share/mkgichessclub/db_migrate_2.1_to_2.2.sql

  where _mkgichessclub_ is the database name chosen during the installation
  of the port.

  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/ktorrent
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  ktorrent has been updated to 3.1.5 for KDE 4. The last release of ktorrent
  for KDE 3 is available under net-p2p/ktorrent2.

20081121:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/smstools3
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The startup script of comms/smstools3 has changed. For increased security
  smstools now runs as user uucp / group dialer by default. The script
  commands like sendsms etc. should be executed as user uucp.
  To restore the old behaviour, set smsd_user="root" and smsd_group="wheel"
  in your /etc/rc.conf.

  Hint: use security/sudo for running smsd scripts as user uucp.

20081108:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/tamago
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The Wnn backend of editors/tamago port now uses unix domain socket
  to communicate the server by default.  If $[CJKT]SERVER environment
  variable is defined, the value is used as the server host name.  In
  JSERVER case, for example, the server name is determined in the
  following way:

	$JSERVER --(if null)--> wnn-jserver --(if null)--> "unix"

  If the server host name is null or matches "^unix$", unix domain
  socket is used.  The path name of the socket can be specified in
  wnn-[cjkt]udpath custom variable.

  /etc/shells.

20081030:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/FreeWnn-server
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The jserver daemon in japanese/FreeWnn-server port now uses "127.0.0.1"
  as the default listen address for security reason.  If you need
  the wildcard address (INADDR_ANY), you have to explicitly set
  "listenaddr" to 0.0.0.0 in ${PREFIX}/lib/wnn/ja_JP/jserverrc or
  add "-a 0.0.0.0" to ${wnn_flags} in /etc/rc.conf.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of www/asterisk-gui
  AUTHOR: pneumann@gmail.com

  The upgrade to version 2.0 will modify your asterisk dialplan when login
  to the page. Hardware autodetection will not work, pending update of
  misc/zaptel.

20081028:
  AFFECTS: users of www/codeigniter
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  For certain installations, the following steps should be performed
  after the CodeIgniter 1.7.0 upgrade (taken from:
  http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/upgrade_170.html).

  >>> Update your Session Table

  If you are using the Session class in your application, AND if you
  are storing session data to a database, you must add a new column
  named user_data to your session table. Here is an example of what
  this column might look like for MySQL:

	user_data text NOT NULL

  To add this column you will run a query similar to this:

	ALTER TABLE `ci_sessions` ADD `user_data` text NOT NULL

  You'll find more information regarding the new Session functionality
  in the Session class page:

	http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html

  >>> Update your Validation Syntax

  This is an optional, but recommended step, for people currently
  using the Validation class. CI 1.7 introduces a new Form Validation
  class (http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/form_validation.html)
  which deprecates the old Validation library. We have left the old one
  in place so that existing applications that use it will not break, but
  you are encouraged to migrate to the new version as soon as possible.
  Please read the user guide carefully as the new library works a little
  differently, and has several new features.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/sj3-server
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The sj3serv daemon in japanese/sj3-server port now uses "localhost"
  as the default listen address for security reason.  If you need
  the wildcard address (INADDR_ANY), you have to explicitly set
  "servername" to 0.0.0.0 in ${PREFIX}/etc/sj3/serverrc.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3 port have been split into
  japanese/canna-server and japanese/canna-lib, and japanese/sj3-server
  and japanese/sj3-lib, respectively for more fine-grained dependency
  management in the Ports Collection.

20080926:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid30
  AUTHOR: tmseck@netcologne.de

  The Squid developers decided to disable COSS support in 3.0, cf.
  the discussion starting here:

	http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-dev/200809/0067.html

  The corresponding port configuration option WITH_SQUID_COSS is still
  available but is a no-op for now.  If you currently use COSS storage with
  Squid 3.0 you need to disable it in squid.conf.

20080924:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  proftpd now stores its .delay and .scoreboard files in /var/run/proftpd
  instead of /var/run.  If you are updating an existing installation,
  adjust the following in /usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf:

	ScoreboardFile	/var/run/proftpd/proftpd.scoreboard

  Also of note: The third party modules, mod_codeconv, mod_comb, and
  mod_sql_tds are not compatible with this release and have been removed.
  They will be re-added when the respective authors provide updated versions.

20080909:
  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  logcheck now stores its configuration files in /usr/local/etc/logcheck
  instead of /usr/local/etc.  If you are upgrading the port from version
  1.1.1 to version 1.2.54, copy the following files to a temporary location,
  in case they are removed during the upgrade:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.hacking
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.ignore
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations.ignore

  e.g.:

	cd /usr/local/etc
	mkdir /tmp/logcheck.saveconf
	cp logcheck.hacking logcheck.ignore logcheck.violations* \
	   /tmp/logcheck.saveconf

  After the upgrade, integrate your local changes to the files listed
  above into the new configuration files found in the following directories:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/cracking.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.paranoid
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.workstation
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.ignore.d

  Please consult the following files for more information about
  logcheck rules and reporting levels:

	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck
	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck-database

  Also note that the upgraded port installs a crontab file for user
  "logcheck" that executes the logcheck script every hour and emails
  the results to root.  If the installation process cannot install
  the crontab file, it can be installed manually from
  /usr/local/share/examples/logcheck/crontab.in, e.g.:

	crontab -u logcheck /usr/local/share/examples/logcheck/crontab.in

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nagios and net-mgmt/nagios-devel
  AUTHOR: Jarrod Sayers <jarrod@netleader.com.au>

  The stable Nagios port has now been updated to version 3.0.3.  Upgrading
  to this version shouldn't require any configuration changes, but note that
  most sample configuration files were moved into objects/ directory.

  Nagios 2.12 is still available as net-mgmt/nagios2, use the following to
  remain on this legacy stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  Nagios 3.x development continues in net-mgmt/nagios-devel, users of this
  port in production use should consider switching to the stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

20080902:
  AFFECTS: users of math/ploticus
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  This is a major update.

  Deprecated: server-side image maps (use client-side instead); definition
  of categories within proc areadef (use proc categories instead); proc print.

  Discontinued attributes: proc processdata's stack; proc usedata's element,
  proc getdata's rotate, and proc defineunits (use the $changeunits()
  function instead).

  proc rangebar has been renamed proc boxplot and there are major
  functionality changes.  Any script that uses proc rangebar will need
  maintenance.

20080901:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/pine4 and editors/pico
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  These two ports have been removed in favor of the new mail/alpine and

  configuration has changed.  Please read pkg-message and check that
  your server configuration is OK.

20080827:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  With the default Makefile settings, most of the programs are now
  installed outside your $PATH, except for "git", "gitk", and some server
  side programs that need to be accessible for technical reasons.  Invoking
  a git subcommand as "git-xyzzy" from the command line has been deprecated
  since early 2006 (and officially announced in 1.5.4 release notes); use
  of them from your scripts after adding output from "git --exec-path" to
  the $PATH is still supported in this release, but users are again
  strongly encouraged to adjust their scripts to use "git xyzzy" form, as
  we will stop installing "git-xyzzy" hardlinks for built-in commands in
  later releases.

  Please see this URL for more information:

  www/rt38 among possibly other ports.

20080820:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: pneumann@gmail.com

  The database schema has changed in this version of RabbitMQ.  If you
  attempt to start RabbitMQ-1.4.0 over top of a previous installation,
  it will fail, citing "schema_integrity_check_failed".  To correct this,
  delete your mnesia directory (/var/db/rabbitmq/mnesia) and restart
  the server.  Note that this will destroy all your durable exchanges and
  queues, and all your persisted messages!

20080816:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/assp
  AUTHOR: J.R. Oldroyd <fbsd@opal.com>

  The periodic(8) script no longer outputs to files in the assp directory.
  You should remove /var/db/assp/nightly.log and nightly.log.old by hand

  The qt4 ports has been updated to 4.4.1.  With this update several ports
  specific problems have been fixed.  Qt4 headers and libraries have been
  moved to include/qt4 and lib/qt4.  bsd.qt.mk defines QT_INCDIR and
  QT_LIBDIR now, which could be used in qt4-dependent ports if required.
  Before you start to update your ports, please force update of qmake4 and
  qt4-corelib ports.  Portmaster users can do:

	portmaster devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

20080728:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius2
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  Upgrading the FreeRADIUS port used to replace all unmodified files
  in your configuration with the latest version from the sample
  configuration. This strategy has two disadvantages; over time your
  configuration became based on different versions of the sample
  configuration, also major changes to the sample configuration could
  leave your configuration in a confusing state.

  From version 2.0.5, your configuration is not touched if any
  configuration files have been modified.

  You are recommended to track changes in the sample configuration and
  keep your configuration in a version control system. I use Subversion
  (see the devel/subversion port) to track my changes. Keeping the sample
  configuration in a 'vendor branch' (see the Subversion book for more
  details) allows easy merging of changes from the sample configuration.

  *** IMPORTANT ***

  You are urged to move your configuration out of the default location
  (/usr/local/etc/raddb) before upgrading from 2.0.4 (or earlier)
  to 2.0.5 (or later). Once this upgrade is complete, remove the sample
  configuration that has been installed in the default location and
  move your configuration back to the default location.

  This is a one time procedure that will prevent unmodified files in
  your configuration from being deleted from your configuration and not
  restored during the upgrade. No customised files will be lost in any
  circumstances.

  The sample configuration in 2.0.5 has been reorganised: the
  configuration of most modules is now in the modules directory rather
  than in radiusd.conf. You are urged to rearrange your configuration
  to match this layout.

  There are several improvements in this version of the port, including
  a new pkg-message that will help new FreeRADIUS users to get started
  with the port, also new 'reload' and 'debug' commands for the rc.d
  script. Enjoy!

  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Anjuta's neon dependency has been switched from neon26 to neon28.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following to upgrade:

	portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26
	portupgrade anjuta

20080714:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: Thomas-Martin Seck <tmseck@web.de>

  www/squid has been updated to Squid 2.7.STABLE3.

  The update should be rather straightforward.

  The only noticeable change in the port is that the ICAP patch is no
  longer included; this is because this patch was unmaintained for a long
  time and its use was not really recommended.  Please consider moving to
  Squid-3 (currently available as www/squid30) if you need ICAP support.

  Squid 2.6 is still available as www/squid26 and will probably be removed
  from the Ports Tree by the end of 2008.

20080712:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/rrdtool
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  If you use language bindings, like the Perl's RRDs, please upgrade
  this port *twice* in order to get the library dependency right.

20080711:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  The port has been deprecated and gtkdatabox has been updated. This was
  done so the port tracks vendor name. Please update by doing:

	portupgrade -o x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2

20080709:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki editpage form now uses the raw page name, not the page title,
  in its `page' CGI parameter.  You will need to rebuild any existing
  IkiWiki installations in order to update their `edit' links to the new
  format.

20080708:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-devel
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to a 20080620 SVN snapshot, which uses the
  new (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade qemu-devel with the
  KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20080705:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki search plug-in now uses www/xapian-omega as backend instead
  of textproc/hyperestraier.  You will need to update the configuration of
  any search enabled IkiWiki installations and rebuild them since the
  search form has changed.

20080704:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/shared-mime-info
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The misc/shared-mime-info has been updated to 0.40. The Mime Types caches
  have been changed a bit. If you have created any custom MIME types, you
  will need to run update-mime-database to update your local Mime Types
  caches:

	$ update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ratbox-services
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Configuration file and database changes have been made between the
  1.1.x series and the current release version of ratbox-services.

  It is highly recommended that services are stopped, and the proper
  upgrade procedure is followed as described in port's documentation,
  before restarting newly updated ratbox-services again.

  Please remember to backup the database before attempting an
  upgrade, as incorrectly upgraded database may be rendered unusable.

  The ratbox-services-1.2.x branch implements multi-language support.
  However, an inconsistency in the language indexing may result in
  errors. It is therefore recommended that the English default to be
  used until the next version release.

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/nocc
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  The Nocc configuration file has been moved into 'config' subdir.
  When updating, remove the old conf.php file and reconfigure Nocc.

20080701:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion*
  AUTHOR: Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>

  subversion now uses neon-0.28.x (www/neon28) port, and automatic
  portupgrade will fail because www/neon28 will conflict with installed
  www/neon26 port.

  You should upgrade neon library before subversion with the command:

	# portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26

  Also, if you use any special subversion ports with bindings, you
  should upgrade these ports to clean subversion port with

	# portupgrade -o devel/subversion subversion-\*

  and install needed bindings (p5-subversion, py-subversion and/or
  ruby-subversion) after that.

  If you use subversion with bindings installed from devel/subversion
  with custom options, don't forget to install separate bindings ports
  after subversion upgrade.

20080630:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/cairo, graphics/poppler*, and future users of www/firefox3
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The poppler* ports have been updated to 0.8.3 and the shared libraries
  have changed.  Firefox 3.0 has been added to the tree as www/firefox3.
  These changes require that all dependent ports be updated.  You can do
  this in one of two ways:

	# portmaster pixman
	# portmaster \*cairo\*
	# portmaster -r poppler-0

  or:

	# pkgdb -Ff
	# portupgrade pixman\* \*cairo\*
	# portupgrade -r poppler-0.\*

20080627:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati
  AUTHOR: Jung-uk Kim <jkim@FreeBSD.org>

  mach64 and r128 drivers are now separated out from the ati driver.
  These video cards are supported by x11-drivers/xf86-video-mach64
  and x11-drivers/xf86-video-r128 respectively. If you have one of
  the affected video cards and xorg.conf contains the following line:

	Driver	"ati"

  you must specify "mach64" or "r128". Alternatively, you may install
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati to get a wrapper driver.

20080626:
  AFFECTS: users of science/gramps
  AUTHOR: Anders Troback <freebsd@troback.com>

  Before you upgrade from 2.x to 3.x you need to export your existing
  databases to a GRAMPS XML file. After the upgrade you can import
  them into the new version.

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ircd-ratbox-devel
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Upgrading between different beta releases can cause problems when
  changes to the ban database schema have occurred.  The 'bantool'
  utility now comes with a -u switch that will check and update the
  ban database as necessary.

  Issuing 'bantool -u' is required when upgrading between beta releases
  and must not be done while the ircd is running.

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security
  AUTHOR: Marcelo Araujo <araujo@FreeBSD.org>

  The mod_security port has been updated from 1.9.4 to 2.5.5. Branch 1.9.x
  will not receive any further updates; all users must update mod_security
  port to versions 2.1 or 2.5.

  You can get more information about update issues at:

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of www/opera and www/opera/devel
  AUTHOR: Ion-Mihai Tetcu <itetcu@FreeBSD.org>

  The Opera port has been updated from 9.2x to 9.5x.  A lot of things have
  been changed such as keyboard shortcuts[1]; new storage and indexing
  formats for mail and feeds; new search.ini; native amd64 binaries; no 4.x
  support.  You will be asked whether to convert mail and feeds to new
  format during start up.  Warning: there is no way to downgrade back to
  the old format.  Be sure to see the Changelog[2].

  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion, subversion-devel and subversion-freebsd
	   with apr from www/apache22
  AUTHOR: Clement Laforet <clement@FreeBSD.org>

  apr and apr-util bundled with apache 2.2.9 have been upgraded to 1.3.x, so
  shared libraries' versions have been bumped. If you are using subversion
  with apache22 apr, you must rebuild subversion after the update.

20080617:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/nvi-devel
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  editors/nvi-devel has been changed to install nvi, nex, and nview as
  to not conflict with editors/2bsd-vi.  Please note the new names if
  you use this port.

20080616:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dkim-milter
  AUTHOR: Hirohisa Yamaguchi <umq@ueo.co.jp>

  Most of the command line options can now be set in configure files.
  So the default values (such as milterdkim_socket) are changed to blank.
  Upgrading users should check the values both in rc.conf and
  dkim-filter.conf.

20080612:
  AFFECTS: users of www/linux-opera
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Opera port has been updated from 9.2x to 9.5x.  A lot of things have
  been changed such as keyboard shortcuts[1]; new storage and indexing
  formats for mail and feeds; new search.ini; probably more that I have
  missed.  I do not know if the keyboard shortcuts and search.ini will be
  overwritten.  You will be asked whether you want mail and feeds to be
  converted to new format during start up.  Warning: there is no way to
  downgrade back to the old format.  Be sure to see the Changelog[2].

  [1] http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/884/
  [2] http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/950/

  It is probably best for you to back up your linux-opera directory in
  case until you have no problem with new Opera for a while.  Also, you
  might have to re-configure search and keyboard shortcuts if these were
  overwritten:

	# cp -Rp ~/.linux-opera ~/.linux-opera-bak

  If you are seeing an error of undefined symbols related to GTK+, it is
  because it needs newer linux-gtk2 that ports doesn't have. You can enter
  'opera:config#FileSelector|DialogToolkit' in the address bar and change
  from 0 to 1 in 'Dialog Toolkit' if it annoys you.  0 = auto detection,
  1 = QT, and 2 = GTK+.

20080610:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/svnmailer
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Some of the config directives and sections allowed have changed.  You will
  have to edit your config file when updating to 1.1.0-dev-r1373 version of
  the port.  Please see the following URL for more information:

  http://opensource.perlig.de/en/svnmailer/doc-1.1/#general-config-charset

  a specific geographic region, look at devel/pear-Date_Holidays_*

20080605:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/paman and audio/pavucontrol
  AUTHOR: lippe@FreeBSD.org

  paman was renamed to pavucontrol, which are two different projects.
  paman is a GTK frontend to PulseAudio, while pavucontrol is a GTK-based
  volume control tool to PulseAudio.

20080605:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of the upgrade to gettext-0.17, the shared library version
  of libintl has changed, so you will need to rebuild all ports that
  depend on gettext:

	# portupgrade -rf gettext
	# portmaster -r gettext

  Given the scope and sheer number of dependent ports, it may be more
  advisable to simply blow away all existing install ports (after
  keeping any local configuration changes), and rebuilding from scratch.

20080603:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs
  AUTHOR: Yasuhiro KIMURA <yasu@utahime.org>

  The port (editors/emacs) is updated to 22.2 and some of Emacs Lisp
  directories had changed.  So you should reinstall all ports that depend
  on it.  Please do something like:

	# portupgrade -fr emacs

20080601:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  If password based logins is enabled in IkiWiki, those passwords were
  stored in cleartext in the userdb.  To guard against exposing users'
  passwords, IkiWiki 2.48 and later use strong (blowfish) hashes for
  storing passwords.

  To hash existing passwords, update to ikiwiki-2.48 and run the
  following command for each of your IkiWiki src dirs:

	ikiwiki-transition hashpassword /path/to/your/wiki/srcdir

20080524:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/jabberd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with version 2.2.0, resolver is now built in the S2S component.
  Jabberd configuration files require updating:

	resolver.xml: may be deleted (file not required anymore)

20080519:
  AFFECTS: users of www/nginx and www/nginx-devel
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  Nginx version lines have been changed: 0.5 -> 0.6 for stable and

  files are compatible with the new version(s).

20080519:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/bitlbee
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  The default installation is now configured for running bitlbee as
  user 'bitlbee'.  Make sure any existing configuration files are
  readable by that user.

20080517:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/smplayer-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The slave port multimedia/smplayer-qt4 has been removed with the upgrade
  of multimedia/smplayer to 0.6.0, qt3 is no longer supported. They are now
  fully integrated into multimedia/smplayer.

  Please uninstall multimedia/smplayer-qt4 port before upgrading
  multimedia/smplayer to version 0.6.0 or higher.

20080513:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: scheidell@secnap.net

  Amavisd-new 2.6.0 introduces several incompatibilities with prior versions.
  If you are upgrading from 2.5.4 or earlier, you will need to update your
  SQL schema.  If you have third party programs that access SQL tables, you
  will need to update those also.

  COMPATIBILITY WITH 2.5.4:

  - when using SQL for logging (e.g. for a pen pals feature) or for
    quarantining, SQL tables tables maddr, msgs, msgrcpt and quarantine need
    to be extended by a new field 'partition_tag';  see below for details;

  - when SQL logging (pen pals) or SQL lookups are used, one can choose a
    binary or a character data type for fields users.email, mailaddr.email,
    and maddr.email; now may be a good opportunity to change a data type
    to binary (string of bytes);  see below for details;

  - when using SQL for logging, a default for $sql_clause{'upd_msg'}
    has changed, so if a configuration file replaces this SQL clause
    by a non-default setting, it needs to be updated;

  Full information in /usr/local/share/doc/amavisd-new/RELEASE_NOTES.

20080513:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/ampache
  AUTHOR: jadawin@FreeBSD.org

  Ampache 3.4 uses a different config parser.  Unfortunately the new parser
  is unable to read old config files.  In order to migrate your current
  configuration, you should run `php ${WWWDIR}/bin/migrate_config.inc' from
  the command line.

20080508:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/ptop
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The authors have changed the name of this utility to `pg_top'.  To avoid
  conflict with another port in the Tree with the same name we have retained
  `ptop' as the portname.  Note that binary has also changed to `pg_top'.
  Please start the utility with that name after updating.

20080507:
  AFFECTS: Perl interface users of audio/gramofile
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  Perl support is removed due to devel/swig11 removal in ports.  If you use
  the Perl interface, you are encouraged to use the new Audio::Gramofile
  found on CPAN (contact me for the ports).

20080506:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/collectd
  AUTHOR: daniel@roe.ch

  Previously, net-mgmt/collectd used to remove the config file even if it
  was changed by the user. This has now been fixed.

  To upgrade without losing your configuration, copy
  ${PREFIX}/etc/collectd.conf away to a safe place before upgrading
  net-mgmt/collectd.

  In addition, the default location of the data files changed from
  ${PREFIX}/var/lib/collectd to /var/db/collectd; you may want to move your
  data files and edit your configuration accordingly.

20080408:
  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-Apache-Test
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/p5-Apache-Test doesn't actually need www/mod_perl{1,2}. If you would
  like to test a mod_perl, than please install www/mod_perl2 or www/mod_perl
  as well. The ports infrastructure doesn't support this (yet) but you can
  use it to test www/apache13, www/apache20, and/or www/apache22 without
  chaining www/p5-Apache-Test.

20080405:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/tracker
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org

  The sysutils/tracker port is now a meta port and tracker is now split into

  AFFECTS: users of net/skype net/skype-devel
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  For FreeBSD versions 7.0 and above:

  It is required with both skype and skype-devel to update to linux_base-fc6.
  Please do the following:

  1. Make sure there are no running Linux applications.
  2. Unmount linprocfs (umount /compat/linux/proc)
  3. Uninstall your current linux_base port
  4. Set appropriate sysctl (sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16)
  5. Install emulators/linux_base-fc6
  6  Remount linprocfs (mount /compat/linux/proc)
  7. Add compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 to etc/sysctl.conf
  8. Add OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=fc6 to /etc/make.conf

  Note: These instructions also apply to linux_base-f8, please use the same
  osrelease.

  For FreeBSD versions 5.X and 6.X:

  Please use the legacy version net/skype12:

	portupgrade -o net/skype12 net/skype

20080316:

20080312:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/enlightenment-devel, x11/ecore and grephics/evas
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  Evas and ecore ports have been split to separate modules to simplify
  dependency tracking. Thus, portupgrade in many cases won't be able to
  correctly update these ports.

  The easiest upgrade path would be to remove all EFL ports and install
  them from scratch. At least, you should reinstall ecore and evas.

  Please note that your old $HOME/.e is no longer compatible with new
  snapshot version. You will need to remove this directory and let e17
  create it automatically on the next startup.

20080306:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The update to version 1.0.12 will require manual change to the active
  configuration file.

  mail_extra_groups setting was commonly used insecurely. This setting is now
  deprecated. Most users should switch to using mail_privileged_group setting,
  but if you really need the old functionality use mail_access_groups instead.

20080303:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  gnutls has been updated to 2.2.2 and all shared libraries' versions have

  AUTHOR: jacula@gmail.com

  From now XMonad uses a new configuration file system, so you don't have
  to edit Config.hs anymore.  Instead, create a custom configuration file
  ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs.  You can take a look at some samples on Xmonad's
  website.  Note that you can be interested in x11-wm/xmonad-contrib.

  The HashFunction class template has been changed in an incompatible way.
  The member function formerly named hash() is now the function call
  operator.  If you have defined your own HashFunction classes, then you
  have to update your code.

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/symon
  AUTHOR: uspoerlein@gmail.com

  The symon port has been updated from 2.75 to 2.78. It changes the wire
  protocol again. You should update your symux(8) and symon(8) installations
  simultaneously, as:

    - new symon clients will make old symux servers exit, and
    - new symux servers don't understand the old symon client's if() and
      mem() probes.

  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  As was claimed in the entry 20070301 below in this file, you should fill
  ALT_DEPENDS section of pkgtools.conf for portupgrade to work correctly
  with your alternative dependencies.  Now it is an obligatory requirement.

  It was done as a compromise between speed and complexity.

  AFFECTS: users of www/xshttpd
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  www/xshttpd now uses ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/ as a root directory for its
  data files.  The xshttpd configuration files have been moved to
  ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/conf/.  Please move the appropriate local files
  manually if you are upgrading from 3.4 or older versions.

20080202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/punbb
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  Install paths have changed. Please do the following prior to upgrade:

	cd /usr/local/www
	mv punbb punbb.old
	cp -R punbb.old/upload punbb

  It is now safe to update as usual.

  Notes:

  * You will probably get uninstall errors regarding files not found. It's
    safe to ignore them
  * Your webserver path has changed from www/punbb/upload to www/punbb,
    please adjust your webserver configuration and restart it
  * When you are satisfied with everything working properly you may remove
    the punbb.old directory:
	rm -r /usr/local/www/punbb.old

  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Deluge was updated to version 0.5.8.2.  If you are using blocklist plugin,
  you have to remove blocklist.conf first before you can run it, or it will
  crash upon start up.

	$ rm -f ~/.config/deluge/blocklist.conf

  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security2
  AUTHOR: araujo@FreeBSD.org

  Update of mod_security2 is a dramatic change, because there is a need
  to completely rewrite their obsolete rules and migrate for capacity to
  use new syntax.

  You are advised to make a complete backup of your configuration files
  before you can perform an update.

  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  FreeRADIUS 2.0 is now available as the net/freeradius2 port. All FreeRADIUS
  users are advised to consider upgrading to 2.0. It is the FreeRADIUS team's
  intention to put the 1.x server into 'maintenance' mode with just critical
  bug fixes.[1] 2.0 has many improvements including numerous bug fixes that
  were too difficult for the 1.x server, as well as many new features.

  Before uninstalling 1.x, it is recommended that you backup your
  configuration, which is typically in /usr/local/etc/raddb, then move it
  out of the way. It is also worth backing up the default configuration,
  which is typically in /usr/local/share/examples/freeradius/raddb.

  1.x configurations should work with the 2.0 server [2]. However the port
  automatically upgrades any unedited files in the configuration when you
  install a new version of FreeRADIUS. Installing 2.0 with the residue of a
  1.x configuration in the default location will result in a mixed 1.x and
  2.0 configuration that may not work.

  The recommended approach is to diff your 1.x configuration against the
  default 1.x configuration, then make corresponding changes to a copy
  of the default 2.0 configuration. If you moved your 1.x configuration out
  of the way before upgrading, you will have a 2.0 configuration ready to
  edit in the default location. It is worth reading man 5 unlang for details
  of the new FreeRADIUS 'un-language' before starting.

  Alternatively, you can move your 1.x configuration to another location,
  such as /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1, then edit /etc/rc.conf to point the rc.d
  script to that location. For example:

	radiusd_flags="-d /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1"

  I cannot guarantee that all 1.x configurations will work with the 2.0
  server, and I only recommend using a 1.x configuration as an interim
  measure.

  Perforce has been updated to version 2007.3. Upgrading is fairly
  straightforward, but it is still highly recommended to follow the
  upgrading instructions in the release notes:

  AFFECTS: users of irc/bitlbee
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  irc/bitlbee now stores saved user settings in /var/db/bitlbee/, not
  $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/.  You will have to manually move any existing user
  settings to the new location (or override the user settings directory
  using -d if you wish to keep the old behavior).  Other configuration
  files are still kept in $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/ by default.

  The default installation is now configured for running bitlbee as user
  'nobody' by default.  Make sure any existing configuration files are
  readable by that user.
