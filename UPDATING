This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/erlang-lite
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/erlang-lite port uses the same default options as
  lang/erlang, which were changed some time ago.

  The couchdb, rabbitmq, freeswitch-core and freeswitch-core-devel
  ports have been updated to use lang/erlang rather than lang/erlang-lite.

  Please check that your lang/erlang options are configured as you
  wish (especially X11 support), then follow the instructions below
  to update your dependencies.

  # portmaster -o lang/erlang lang/erlang-lite
  or
  # portupgrade -fo lang/erlang erlang-lite  

20120810:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission-gtk2
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Unfortunately Transmission 2.61 moved the requirement for GTK to version
  3.2.0, which is not yet in our tree.

  Those who wish to have a graphical client can either choose transmission-qt4
  in the meantime, or switch to the transmission25 ports.

  A script to generate appropriate commands can be found at:
  http://people.FreeBSD.org/~crees/scripts/transmission25.sh

20120808:
  AFFECTS: users of www/libmicrohttpd
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  libmicrohttpd has been updated to version 0.9.21, with a shared library bump.
  This requires dependent ports to be rebuilt.

  # portmaster -r libmicrohttpd
  or
  # portupgrade -r www/libmicrohttpd
  or
  # pkg install -fR www/libmicrohttpd

20120804:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/libglut
  AUTHOR: x11@FreeBSD.org

  The libglut library is replaced by the freeglut library.
  Due to shlib version bump all glut users should be rebuild.
  Please follow the instructions below to upgrade.

  # portmaster -o graphics/freeglut graphics/libglut
  # portmaster -r freeglut
  or
  # env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -fo graphics/freeglut libglut\*
  # portupgrade -frx freeglut freeglut
  or
  # pkg set -o graphics/libglut:graphics/freeglut
  # pkg install -Rf graphics/freeglut

20120801:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  GNU Emacs port is updated to 24.1. Emacs 23 is moved to editors/emacs23.

  If you prefer to stick with Emacs 23, please specify EMACS_PORT_NAME=emacs23
  in /etc/make.conf, and do:

  # portmaster -o editors/emacs23 editors/emacs
  or
  # env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -fo editors/emacs23 editors/emacs
  or
  # pkg set -o editors/emacs:editors/emacs23

20120726:
  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox, www/seamonkey, mail/thunderbird, www/libxul
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  Gecko ports were switched to use system libraries. Some of them
  must be built with certain options set (default).

  - graphics/png has to be installed with APNG option
  
  - databases/sqlite3 has to be installed with SECURE_DELETE, THREADSAFE,
    FTS3, UNLOCK_NOTIFY options

20120726:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/pkg-config
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  devel/pkg-config has been replaced by devel/pkgconf

  # portmaster -o devel/pkgconf devel/pkg-config
  or
  # portupgrade -fo devel/pkgconf pkg-config-\*

  pkgng:
  # pkg set -o devel/pkg-config:devel/pkgconf
  # pkg install -f devel/pkgconf

20120725:
  AFFECTS: users of chinese/fcitx
  AUTHOR: lichray@gmail.com

  The textproc/fcitx-keyboard port is merged into chinese/fcitx.
  Before updating, be sure to

  # pkg_delete -f fcitx-keyboard-\*

  And make sure you have at least one keyboard layout based input method
  enabled in fcitx-configtool, to keep the activation/deactivation of IM
  panel working.

  And, since chinese/fcitx-sunpinyin depends on an update to
  chinese/sunpinyin

20120725:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-beautifulsoup
  AUTHOR: rm@FreeBSD.org

  Current www/py-beautifulsoup has been moved to www/py-beautifulsoup32,
  since 4.1.1 is now current stable version.

  If you prefer to stick with 3.2.0 do:

  # portmaster -o www/py-beautifulsoup32 www/py-beautifulsoup

20120723:
  AFFECTS: users of security/snort
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  The database output modules have been deprecated.  If you need this
  functionality please look at the security/barnyard2 port.

20120723:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/ImageMagick and graphics/ImageMagick-nox11
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The options for ImageMagick have been changed to match commonly used
  option names. If you are using a customized build, please reconfigure
  your port options with "make config".

20120720:
  AFFECTS: users of net/spread and net/spread4
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The ports net/spread and net/spread4 are using now the
  reserved UID/GID 282 instead (user|group)next.

20120722:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mutt-devel has been moved to mail/mutt, since 1.5 has been around
  for a while.

  Should you wish to stick with version 1.4 at this time;

  # portmaster -o mail/mutt14 mutt

20120721:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/libogg
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  There is a new version of libogg (1.3.0) and the shared library version
  has been bumped (ogg.7 to ogg.8).  All ports that have an identifiable
  direct dependency on this library have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.
  However, some ports that pull in the library indirectly may continue to
  look for the old version.  To ensure that all are updated, perform this
  step:

  # portmaster -r libogg
  or
  # portupgrade -rf libogg

20120717:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The options of ProFTPD have been made much more user-friendly.
  As the modules are all shared libraries, all possible modules are built
  and installed. The following modules are now in separate slave ports:

  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_odbc: mod_sql_odbc
  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_sqlite: mod_sql_sqlite
  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_tds: mod_sql_tds
  net/proftpd-mod_ldap: mod_ldap and mod_quotatab_ldap

20120716:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The following port options have been reorganized:
  The OPENLDAP option has been renamed to LDAP.
  The MAGNET and CML options have been withdrawn in favor of new LUA option.

20120716:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  The postscreen-to-smtpd protocol has changed.  To avoid "cannot
  receive connection attributes" warnings and dropped connections,
  execute the command "postfix reload".

20120716:
  AFFECTS: Nobody
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  The FreeBSD ports tree switched from CVS to Subversion. A Subversion
  to CVS exporter is in place to continue the support of CVSup.

20120709:
  AFFECTS: users of math/metis
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  The older version of metis has been moved to math/metis4, and
  math/metis has been updated to 5.0.2.  Dependent ports still use
  the old API, and the different versions of metis cannot coexist, so
  most users should update with:

  # portmaster -o math/metis4 math/metis
  # portmaster -r math/metis4

  or the equivalent.

20120702:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/couchdb
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org, Adam Strohl <adams-ports@ateamsystems.com>

  The couchdb port has an unfortunate side effect; versions before 1.2.0
  will clobber local.ini.  The port will refuse to build if that file is
  present and an earlier version is installed, however no such protection
  can be afforded to package installation.

  To upgrade from 1.1.0 and earlier, simply move PREFIX/etc/couchdb/local.ini
  out of the way until the upgrade is complete.

20120702:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/mikutter
  AUTHOR: tota@FreeBSD.org

  The net-im/mikutter has been updated to 0.1.1.810 which is required
  Ruby 1.9.2 or later. Before upgrading this port, please see the entry
  20110822 in this file to upgrade Ruby to 1.9.

  If you want to stay with 0.0.3 (requires Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2 or later),
  please run the following command:

  # portmaster -o net-im/mikutter003 net-im/mikutter
  or
  # portupgrade -o net-im/mikutter003 net-im/mikutter

20120630:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.16 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.12, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f perl-5.12.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

  The default version for Perl has also been changed from 5.12 to 5.14.

20120623:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/xfce4-utils
  AUTHOR: xfce@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been discontinued, and installs files that conflict with
  the new versions of misc/xfce4-appfinder and x11-wm/xfce4-session.

  # pkg_delete -f xfce4-utils-\*
  # portmaster misc/xfce4-appfinder x11-wm/xfce4-session

20120618:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db5
  AUTHOR:  mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/db5 port has been upgraded to BerkeleyDB 5.3.  This
  entails a shared library bump.

  Before upgrading this port, check if your applications use
  transactional data bases, and if they do, prepare them for a log file
  format upgrade.  YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE YOU UPGRADE THE DB5 PORT!  See:
  http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_02/html/upgrading/upgrade_process.html

  All packages that depend on db5 need to be rebuilt due to the shared
  library version change.  The full changelog is at
  http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/products/berkeleydb/html/changelog_5_3.html

  To upgrade the packages that need Berkeley DB 5, please
  issue one of the following commands (depending on your preferred tool):

    # portmaster -r db5-5
  or
    # portupgrade -fr databases/db5

20120616:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The lighttpd startup script has been changed and is now compatible to the
  apache startup script. The "reload" subcommand now sends a SIGHUP to the
  process and triggers cycling of log files. The new command "graceful"
  performs a graceful restart (similiar to former "reload") and "gracefulstop"
  performs a graceful stop. The "check" command has been replaced with
  the "configtest" command.

20120615:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/akonadi
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The latest Akonadi update includes critical bug fixes. Manual
  intervention is required for people using local MySQL database (the
  default configuration) as backend:

  $ akonadictl stop

  Wait a bit, and make sure that akonadiserver and akonadi_control are
  not running. Kill them if needed. Then, you have two alternatives:

  $ mysql_install_db --force \
    --defaults-file=~/.local/share/akonadi/mysql.conf \
    --datadir=~/.local/share/akonadi/db_data \
    --basedir=$(dirname `dirname $(which mysql_install_db)`)
  $ rm ~/.local/share/akonadi/mysql.conf

  ...or...

  $ rm -r ~/.local/share/akonadi

  In the latter case, Akonadi will have to recache your personal data
  (might take a while). Akonadi is only a cache, no data will be lost.
  Then:

  $ akonadictl start

20120613:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/djvulibre and graphics/djvulibre-nox11
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  DjVuLibre been updated to 3.5.25.3.  The QT3 GUI that was in
  graphics/djvulibre has been removed (users of this GUI should consider
  switching to the new QT4 GUI in graphics/djview4), and
  graphics/djvulibre-nox11 has been merged back into graphics/djvulibre.
  To update DjVuLibre, you can use:

  # pkg_delete djvulibre-\?.\*
  # portmaster -o graphics/djvulibre djvulibre-nox11

  You should then update any installed ports that link to the djvulibre shared
  library: converters/pdf2djvu, graphics/djview4, graphics/okular, and --
  if optional djvulibre support was enabled -- graphics/ImageMagick,
  graphics/apvlv, and graphics/evince.

20120612:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql-libpqxx
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  postgresql-libpqxx has been updated to 4.0. If you want to stick
  with version 3, install postgresql-libpqxx30:

  # portmaster -o databases/postgresql-libpqxx30 postgresql-libpqxx

20120612:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/gdal
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Language bindings (Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby) have been moved to separate
  ports. Please install them if required. The new ports are:
    Perl binding:   graphics/p5-Geo-GDAL
    PHP binding:    graphics/php-gdal
    Python binding: graphics/py-gdal
    Ruby binding:   graphics/ruby-gdal

20120605:
  AFFECTS: users of net/p5-ZConf
  AUTHOR: vvelox@vvelox.net

  Please append '.set' to all sets for the FS backend. This was done to prevent
  collisions between config and set names. Previously the config
  "someConfig/default" would collide with the set "default" for "someConfig".

20120603:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  Note that The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler and the Haskell Platform
  have been updated to versions 7.4.1 and 2012.2.0.0, respectively.  At the
  same time, all Haskell ports have been updated to their latest working
  versions.

  To follow the changes, please issue one of the following commands
  (depending on the tool used):

  # portmaster -r ghc
  or
  # portupgrade -fr lang/ghc


20120531:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/png
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The PNG library has been updated to version 1.5.10.  Please rebuild all
  ports that depend on it.

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -r png-
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr graphics/png

20120531:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/koffice-kde4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KOffice 2 has been replaced by Calligra. You are encouraged to
  deinstall any KOffice port and install equivalent Calligra ones:

  # pkg_delete \*koffice\*
  # portmaster editors/calligra <additional l10n ports>

20120530:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql*-server
  AUTHOR:  jgh@FreeBSD.org

  Affected users are those who use the crypt(text, text) function with
  DES encryption in the optional pg_crypto module. Passwords affected
  are those that contain characters that cannot be represented with
  7-bit ASCII. If a password contains a character that has the most
  significant bit set (0x80), and DES encryption is used, that character
  and all characters after it will be ignored.

20120530:
  AFFECTS: users of net/nss-pam-ldapd
  AUTHOR: scheidell@FreeBSD.org

  The net/nss-pam-ldapd port no longer provides an option for SASL. This has
  been sourced out to the new net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl port, to accomodate
  users using packages (see ports/162240). Users with openldap-sasl-client
  installed are encouraged to change the port's origin to:
  net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl using their favorite ports management tool.
  Example for portmaster:
  portmaster -o net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl nss-pam-ldapd

20120527:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/qt4-gui
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Qt started using the raster graphics system engine, which relies on
  shared memory. Be sure to check pkg-message.

20120525:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kdepim4, deskutils/kdepim4-runtime
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  kdepim4 has been updated to 4.8.3. For those who prefer old
  kdepim-4.4.11.1 deskutils/kdepim44* ports have been added.
  To stay with kdepim-4.4.11.1 run the following commands:

  # portmaster -o deskutils/kdepim44-runtime kdepim-runtime-4\*
  # portmaster -o deskutils/kdepim44 kdepim-4\*

20120525:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.8.3. Several ports were split,
  thus manual intervention into update procedure is required:

  # pkg_delete -f kde-runtime-\* ruby\*-kdebindings-korundum\* \
    kalgebra-4\* kdeaccessibility-4\* kdeutils-4\* kde-baseapps-\* \
    plasma-applet-icontasks\*
  # portmaster -a

20120518:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/poweradmin
  AUTHOR: Edmondas Girkantas <eg@fbsd.lt>

  Some database changes have been made between version 2.1.4 and 2.1.5,
  upgrading needs to be done manually by running the following SQL:

  For MySQL users:

  ALTER TABLE `zones` ADD `zone_templ_id` INT( 11 ) NOT NULL;
  ALTER TABLE zones ENGINE = InnoDB;
  ALTER TABLE zone_templ ENGINE = InnoDB;
  ALTER TABLE zone_templ_records ENGINE = InnoDB;

  For PostgreSQL users:

  ALTER TABLE zones ADD zone_templ_id INT DEFAULT NULL;

  Source: https://www.poweradmin.org/trac/wiki/ReleaseNotes/2.1.5

20120516:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  PHP has been updated to 5.4. Suhosin patch has been disabled until the
  new version will be released (soon). Suhosing extension will take more
  time. LINKTHR option is now enabled by default, be sure to flag it if
  you are updating using an old saved configuration. sqlite2 extension
  has been permanently removed.
  If you want to remain at PHP 5.3, a new port (lang/php53) has been
  created for such purpose.

20120513:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/smokeping
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Smokeping has been updated to 2.6.7, and the web server configuration
  has changed. FastCGI is now preferred. Please check the documentation
  that your web server configuration is OK.

20120512:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/p5-XML-SAX
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  p5-XML-SAX (X-S) was split into p5-XML-SAX-Base (X-S-B) and p5-XML-SAX for
  version 0.99.  Since X-S-B now installs some files formerly installed by X-S
  the package for X-S must be deinstalled before updating X-S.

  # pkg_delete -fx p5-XML-SAX
  # portmaster textproc/p5-XML-SAX

  (users of pkgng can substitute pkg_delete with pkg delete)

20120511:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/xpdf
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  In order to allow graphics/xpdf and graphics/poppler-utils to coexist,
  graphics/xpdf binaries have been moved from ${LOCALBASE}/bin to
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf. The symlink ${LOCALBASE}/bin/xpdf points to
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf/xpdf. However the other utilities installed by
  the xpdf port conflict with poppler-utils, no symlinks are maintained.
  Applicaions and scripts which use the pdf* utilities provided by
  graphics/xpdf must reference them using their new location, specify
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf in $PATH, or use the same utilities provided by
  graphics/poppler-utils.

20120510:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gitolite
  AUTHOR: milki@rescomp.berkeley.edu

  gitolite has been split into two ports: devel/gitolite for 3.x and
  devel/gitolite2 for 2.x

  gitolite 3.x is NOT "API" compatible with gitolite 2.x and requires
  additional manual migration steps which can be found in the online
  documentation.

  http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/install.html#migr

  Current users wishing to continue using gitolite 2.x should run:

  # portmaster -o devel/gitolite2 gitolite
    or
  # portupgrade -o devel/gitolite2 gitolite

20120508:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node and www/node-devel
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  npm is a package manager for node. Starting with node 0.6.17 (www/node) and
  node 0.7.8 (www/node-devel), we do not install bundled npm but provide a
  separate port (www/npm). Please install www/npm if you need it.

20120430:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-google-api-python-client
  AUTHOR: nivit@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 1.0.b8. This new version has important
  changes which might break your code:

  * apiclient.anyjson has moved to oauth2client.anyjson.
  * Some calls, for example, taskqueue().lease() used to require
    a parameter named body. In this new release only methods that
    really need to send a body require a body parameter, and so
    you may get errors about an unknown 'body' parameter in your call.
    The solution is to remove the unneeded body={} parameter

  See http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/wiki/PyDoc for
  more information.

20120426:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/libreoffice
  AUTHORS: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  LOCALIZED_LANG option has gone, localised packages are now available
  separately, you can also use editors/libreoffice-i18n to pick the
  localisation you want.

20120425:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix, mail/postfix2[6-8]
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  The latest update to these ports adds support to turn off
  the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.1.
  These protocols are known to cause inter-operability issues
  with certain services, e.g. hotmail.  If using TLS with Postfix,
  please consult the RELEASE_NOTES for information about possible
  workarounds.

20120423:
  AFFECTS: users of astro/boinc-astropulse
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  Astropulse has been updated to 6.01, which is a different application
  than version 5.06.  You need to have Astropulse v6 enabled in your

  AFFECTS: users of www/chpasswd
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Previous version of the chpasswd port put the configuration file
  in the pkg-plist, causing it to be removed on deinstall.

  Ircd-ratbox has been updated to follow the current stable release
  branch (3.0.x). All previous branches are no longer supported by the
  ratbox team.

  Users of ircd-ratbox are advised to create new ircd configuration
  files based on the examples provided.

20120404:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/net-snmp
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  The net-snmp startup script now specifies a new pid_file to avoid a
  conflict that existed with bsnmpd.  As a result, the startup script
  cannot find currently running versions of snmpd.

  You will need to either stop the daemon before upgrading or locate the
  PID of snmpd and manually kill it after upgrade.  Then, start the daemon
  as you normally would.

20120326:
  AFFECTS: users of www/tomcat7
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  Tomcat 7 startup script now uses 'jsvc' to monitor the daemon's process.
  A few rc.conf variables has been changed, be sure to adapt your
  configuration, if needed.

20120318:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dbmail
  AUTHOR: rm@FreeBSD.org

  dbmail 3.0 is now available.

  There are a number of significant changes including Dependencies,
  Config, Schema and Server changes.

  Without required modifications, dbmail will not run and you will
  no longer have access to your emails. See UPGRADING for details.
  Don't forget to backup and fully test before upgrading.

  To stick with version 2.2.x run:
  # portupgrade -o mail/dbmail22 mail/dbmail
  or
  # portmaster -o mail/dbmail22 mail/dbmail

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8 and lang/perl5.10
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 and lang/perl5.10 have been restored from the Attic
  in order to give a FreeBSD-style deprecation cycle.  However, users
  are advised to upgrade to perl5.12 as soon as feasible.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8 and lang/perl5.10
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 and lang/perl5.10 have been removed since they've
  been EOL upstream for 3yrs and 2yrs respectively.  The default
  of lang/perl5.12 has not changed (yet).  Conditional checks for
  perl < 5.12 have been removed.  UNLESS you have PERL_VERSION=5.8.x
  or PERL_VERSION=5.10.x in /etc/make.conf you need take no action.
  If you do, you will have to recompile all perl dependant ports after
  updating your ports tree.  Please see entry 20110517 for help.

20120225:
  AFFECTS: users of archivers/libarchive
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

20120210:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  Postfix 2.9.0 contains several major changes, some of which could
  result in incompatible or unexpected behavior.  Regardless of the
  version from which you are upgrading, please carefully review the
  RELEASE_NOTES before proceeding.

20120126:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd and ftp/proftpd-mysql
  AUTHOR: Martin Matuska <mm@FreeBSD.org>

  The proftpd port has been updated to 1.3.4 and changed to use
  dynamically loadable modules. Please add corresponding LoadModule
  directives to your configuration file, like in the following example:

    LoadModule mod_tls.c

  The modules mod_sql_mysql and mod_sql_postgres are now outside of the
  main proftpd port:
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_mysql
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_postgres

  The proftpd-mysql port has been removed, use the alternative port:
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_mysql

20120121:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/vdr
  AUTHOR: Juergen Lock <nox@FreeBSD.org>

  The vdr ports have been updated to 1.7.22 which involves at least
  two changes:

  - svdrpsend.pl is now called svdrpsend.

  - The ttxtsubs channels.conf format has changed so if you use that
    plugin you need to edit /usr/local/etc/vdr/channels.conf for the
    channels you want to receive teletext subtitles on - see:

        /usr/local/share/doc/vdr-plugin-ttxtsubs/HISTORY

20120116:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  From the upstream RELEASE_NOTES:

  Instead of terminating immediately with a "fatal" message when a
  database file can't be opened, a Postfix daemon program now logs
  an "error" message, and continues execution with reduced
  functionality.

  Specify "daemon_table_open_error_is_fatal = yes" to get the
  historical behavior (immediate termination with "fatal" message).

  Logfile-based alerting systems may need to be updated to look for
  "error" messages in addition to "fatal" messages.

  By default the Postfix SMTP server no longer reports transcripts
  of sessions where a client command is rejected because a table is
  unavailable.  To receive such reports, add the new "data" class to
  the notify_classes parameter value. The reports will be sent to the
  error_notice_recipient address as before. This class is also used
  by the Postfix SMTP client to report about sessions that fail
  because a table is unavailable.

20120116:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xcb-util
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  x11/xcb-util was updated to 0.3.8 and was split in new modules.
  Dependencies were adjusted but main port symbols were moved to a single
  library, xcb-util.so.  For this reason, all dependent ports must be
  recompiled.If you use portmaster, run:

  # portmaster -R -r xcb-util-0

  Or for portupgrade:

  # portupgrade -r xcb-util-0\*

  AFFECTS: users of lang/newlisp
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  In lang/newlisp, the MYSQL5 and MYSQL51 options have been unified into
  MYSQL, which will pick the correct MySQL version using the standard
  MySQL selection logic. MySQL users will have to run "make config" and
  select the MYSQL option.

  Tinderbox users will have to update their options files with the new
  MYSQL option, and possibly change their Tinderbox environment to select
  a specific MySQL version.

20111229:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd{-devel,-mysql}
  AUTHORS: delphij@FreeBSD.org,mm@FreeBSD.org

  Due to the nature of the way FreeBSD-SA-11:07.chroot is implemented,

  AFFECTS: users of ruby-gnome ports
  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  ruby-gnome has been updated to 1.0.3. Some of them have been removed
  since they are no longer included upstream. The meta port is
  now x11/ruby-gnome2. To update run the following command:

  # portmaster -o x11/ruby-gnome2 x11/ruby-gnome2-all

  You may also wish to remove the old ports using:

  # portmaster -s

  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  The new versions of flpsed and dillo have switched from
  x11-toolkits/fltk2 to the new fltk 1.3.0 from x11-toolkits/fltk.
  Users who have customizations specific to fltk2 may need to consult
  the fltk 1.3 documents in order to adjust their local settings. For
  dillo, some commonly-used key bindings have changed, and new
  configuration options are available: consult dillorc.dist and
  keysrc.dist for details.

20111019:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/thunderbird or www/seamonkey with lightning
           plugin installed.
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  To get an up to date version of lightning you should use the new
  LIGHTNING option in mail/thunderbird or www/seamonkey. This option
  is not enabled by default so you have to run "make config" prior
  to the build. The old deskutils/lightning-thunderbird and
  deskutils/lightning ports should no longer be used and will be
  removed very soon.

  Like other XPIs ports, lightning now registers itself as a global
  extension and doesn't create the XPI to be installed manually.
  Upgrading users should remove lightning from their profile before
  installing Thunderbird or SeaMonkey the first time with the new
  LIGHTNING option enabled.

20111018:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  The default smtp_address_preference value is now "any" instead
  of "ipv6", meaning choose randomly between IPv6 and IPv4. With
  this the Postfix SMTP client will have more success delivering
  mail to sites that have problematic IPv6 configurations.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-subversion-freebsd
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  devel/p5-subversion-freebsd has been removed as it is no longer necessary.
  If you have it installed please run the following to switch to
  devel/p5-subversion:

  portmaster -o devel/p5-subversion p5-subversion-freebsd

  Please also see the second entry below (20111016) if haven't upgraded
  subversion yet.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC has been updated to 4.7.2. A number of files were moved between
  packages and several ports were split, thus manual intervention into
  update procedure is required:

  # pkg_delete -f raptor-1\* kdelibs-4\* kdebase-\*4\* \
    kdeaccessibility-4\* kdeedu-4\* kdegames-4\* kdegraphics-4\* \
    kdesdk-4\* kdeutils-4\* konq-plugins-4\* ktts\* nepomukcontroller\* \
    ruby\*-kdebindings\* kdebindings-smoke\*
  # pkg_delete -f kdehier4\*
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/etc/pam.d/* \
    /usr/local/etc/pam.d/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d/* \
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/services/* \
    /usr/local/share/dbus-1/services/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/system-services/* \
    /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system-services/
  # rmdir /usr/local/kde4/etc/pam.d /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d \
    /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/*services
  # rm -r /var/tmp/kdecache-*
  # portmaster misc/kdehier4

  If you have - or plan to install - net/kdenetwork4, also run:

  # portmaster -o net/linphone-base ortp

  Finally:

  # portmaster -a

  Also, remove /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d from local_startup in rc.conf(5).
  Failure to do this will cause all enabled scripts in /usr/local/etc/rc.d
  to be started twice.

  Remember to check for missing ports, bearing in mind that x11/kdebase4*
  ports were replaced by x11/kde4-* ones, ktts was replaced by jovie, while
  konq-plugins-kde4 and nepomukcontroller were removed. Then:

  # portmaster --check-depends

  You're also encouraged to run `pkg_cutleaves` or similar to check for
  orphaned ports.

  Please, note that `pkg_add -r kde4` will not install Plasma scriptengines
  and printer utilities by default anymore, and `pkg_add -r kdegames4` will
  not install Kajongg. This was made to avoid depending by default on
  kdebindings.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion, devel/subversion-freebsd,
           devel/p5-subversion, devel/py-subversion,
           devel/ruby-subversion and java/subversion-java and
           all dependand ports.
  AUTHOR: Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>

  Subversion was updated to version 1.7.0 and port was reworked.

  Now there is no "devel/subversion-freebsd" port. All FreeBSD-specific patches
  are incorporated into main subversion port as options, which are turned ON by
  default.

  These options are:

  P4_STYLE_MARKERS -- change conflict markers to P4 style,
                      established for FreeBSD projects.
                      This is not mandatory for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  ENHANCED_KEYWORD -- Support for custom keywords, like
                      $ FreeBSD $ in sources.
                      This is MANDATORY for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  FREEBSD_TEMPLATE -- Standard FreeBSD commit template.
                      It is RECOMMENDED for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  Also, subversion 1.7.0 changes the working copy format,
  and a working copy can not be shared between
  subversion 1.7.0 and 1.6.x. Please, think twice before
  upgrading.

  Additional the port "devel/subversion16" was created to
  support subversion 1.6.x. Subversion 1.7.x and 1.6.x
  can not be installed simultaneously!

  Binding ports can be built with Subversion 1.7.0 (Default)
  or with Subversion 1.6.x. To build bindings with subversion 1.6.x
  you should set variable WITH_SUBVERSION_VER to "16".

  There are several ways to upgrade, depending on what you used
  before and what you want to get after upgrade.

  (a) You use devel/subversion without FreeBSD patches and, maybe,
      some bindings. You want fresh'n'new subversion 1.7.0.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion && make config
  <deselect first three options described above, if you want it>
  # portupgrade -r devel/subversion
  or
  # portmaster -R -r subversion-1.6

  (b) You use devel/subversion-freebsd and, maybe, some
      bindings. You want fresh'n'new subversion 1.7.0, again
      with FreeBSD patches.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion && make config
  <make sure that first three options are selected>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portupgrade -r devel/subversion
  or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portmaster -R -r subversion-1.7

  (c) You use devel/subversion without FreeBSD patches and, maybe,
      some bindings. You want good old subversion 1.6.x, again
      without again.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion16 && make config
  <deselect first three options described above, if you want it>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion
  # portupgrade -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -r devel/subversion16
  or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion
  # portmaster -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -R -r subversion-1.6

  (d) You use devel/subversion-freebsd and, maybe, some bindings.
      You want good old subversion 1.6.x, with FreeBSD patches.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion16 && make config
  <make sure, that first three options are selected>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portupgrade -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -r devel/subversion16
  or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portmaster -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -R -r subversion-1.6

  AFFECTS: users of lang/erlang
  AUTHOR: Jimmy Olgeni <olgeni@FreeBSD.org>

  Following the R14B04 upgrade the JAVA, X11, WX and ODBC port
  options have been set to OFF by default; this will allow to replace
  lang/erlang-lite with lang/erlang for headless operation in the
  near future.

  If you need any of these options, run "make config" in lang/erlang
  before upgrading, or set your make.conf accordingly.

20111003:
  AFFECTS: users of math/qhull
  AUTHOR: Stephen Montgomery-Smith <stephen@FreeBSD.org>

  The port math/qhull has been moved to math/qhull5, and math/qhull has been
  updated to a version that is incompatible with all ports previously using
  math/qhull.  If you are upgrading a port that has math/qhull as a dependency,
  please delete the port math/qhull first, so that math/qhull5 is properly
  made as a dependency.

20110929:

  # portmaster -o devel/py-zope.interface devel/py-zopeInterface
  # portmaster -o net/py-zope.proxy net/py-zopeproxy
  # portmaster -o devel/py-zope.testing devel/py-zopetesting

  If you use portupgrade run:
  # portupgrade -o devel/py-zope.interface devel/py-zopeInterface
  # portupgrade -o net/py-zope.proxy net/py-zopeproxy
  # portupgrade -o devel/py-zope.testing devel/py-zopetesting

20110928:
  AFFECTS: users of 10-current
  AUTHOR: eadler@FreeBSD.org

  There are known issues installing ports on FreeBSD 10+ due to
  bogus assumptions by various build scripts. This will not be fixed
  until 9-RELEASE is released.

  There are two workarounds:

  1) Set UNAME_r=9.9-CURRENT in your environment
  2) Set REVISION="9.9" in  ${SRCDIR}/sys/conf/newvers.sh

  with GOST support too. There is no way to check the option when unbound
  builds, so you should make sure the option is on in both unbound and lds.

  AFFECTS: users of www/asterisk-stat
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  asterisk-stat depends on asterisk16 now, you will need to update asterisk
  and asterisk-addons to 1.6. Instructions on upgrading your configuration
  files are here:

  http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.6.2/UPGRADE-1.6.txt

  If you use portmaster run:
  # portmaster -o net/asterisk16 net/asterisk14
  # portmaster -o net/asterisk16-addons net/asterisk14-addons

  If you use portupgrade run:
  # portupgrade -o net/asterisk16 net/asterisk14

  AFFECTS: users of databases/db51
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/db51 port (Oracle Berkeley DB version 5.1) has been
  removed.  Version 5.2 of the package is available in databases/db5.
  Users of ports that depend on the removed 5.1 versions are advised
  to rebuild the affected ports.

20110830:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/racket
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  Racket has been upgraded to version 5.1.3. Due to the recent rewrite of
  the Racket graphics handling code, it is no longer possible to build
  this port without X11.

  The WITHOUT_X11 switch now controls if X11 is brought in as
  USE_GNOME/LIB_DEPENDS or BUILD_DEPENDS.

  In the latter case you will be able to build a Racket package that can
  then be deployed on a headless server.

20110829:
  AFFECTS: users of security/maia
  AUTHOR: Janky Jay, III <ek@purplehat.org>

  There have been many changes to the maia port, including renaming the rc
  script and variables from maia to maiad.  You will need to replace any
  instances of maia with maiad in /etc/rc.conf, as well as renaming /var/amavisd
  to /var/maiad.  The 'vscan' user's home directory also needs to be changed to
  /var/maiad.

  These can be done by:

  # mv /var/amavisd /var/maiad
  # sed -i.bak -e "s/^maia_/maiad_/" /etc/rc.conf
  # pw usermod vscan -d /var/maiad

20110828:
  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-{base,client,image}
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  During the update to 1.4.8, the GNUTLS option was changed from ON to

  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  Along with new features and bug fixes, amavisd-new 2.7.0 introduces some
  incompatibilities with previous releases.  Several variable defaults, SQL
  schemas, and other changes warrant a careful review of the RELEASE_NOTES.
  Also note that helper programs amavis.c and amavis-milter.c are no longer
  distributed with this package; for milter functionality, please shift to
  the dedicated security/amavisd-milter port.

  AFFECTS: users of java/openjdk6
  AUTHOR: jkim@FreeBSD.org

  java/openjdk6 has been updated to b23 and "WEB" option (for web browser
  plug-in and Java Web Start) has been deprecated. If you need the same
  functionality, rebuild the port with "ICEDTEA" option first, then install
  a new port java/icedtea-web with "PLUGIN" option (default). Also, if you
  have a symlink to the previous IcedTeaPlugin.so in ~/.mozilla/plugins,
  for example, you need to remove it. Note system-wide symlinks are now
  automatically created by java/icedtea-web for your convenience.

20110711:
  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-libwww
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  portmaster cannot process the upgrade of www/p5-libwww from version
  5 to version 6. To upgrade p5-libwww, use portupgrade instead, or
  deinstall p5-libwww before reinstalling:

  If you use portmaster:
  # pkg_delete -f 'p5-libwww-5*' ; portmaster www/p5-libwww

  If you use portupgrade, no special treatment is necessary.

20110619:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ezbounce and irc/ezbounce-devel
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  irc/ezbounce-devel was moved to irc/ezbounce as the version previously in
  irc/ezbounce has been broken for some time and the distfile is not available
  anymore.

  If you are upgrading from a 1.0X version make sure to verify that your config
  still works. There is basic compatibility for old config files but a lot has
  changed, see http://linuxftw.com/ezbounce/files/CHANGES

  If you run irc/ezbounce-devel you need to run one of the following commands:

  # portmaster -o irc/ezbounce irc/ezbounce-devel
  or
  # portupgrade -o irc/ezbounce irc/ezbounce-devel

20110619:

20110618:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailscanner
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mailscanner no longer requires running of any renew-* targets to
  update the config files / wrapper scripts; it is now automatically
  performed as the port is installed -- these targets have been removed.

  As an added bonus, the binary package now performs these steps as well,
  in case you don't have a portstree handy.

  Before upgrading, please backup your PREFIX/etc/MailScanner,
  PREFIX/share/MailScanner and PREFIX/libexec/MailScanner if you
  have customised any of these directories, just in case.

20110608:
  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-milter

  socket by specifying -s, please migrate to the new way (specify
  amavisd_milter_socket in /etc/rc.conf).

20110607:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-Moose and devel/p5-Class-MOP
  AUTHOR: az@FreeBSD.org

  p5-Moose has been updated to 2.0007. Now p5-Class-MOP is a part of the
  p5-Moose distribution. Manual intervention of the update procedure is
  required:

    # portmaster -o devel/p5-Moose devel/p5-Class-MOP
    # portmaster -R -r p5-Moose-\*

  or do the same things with portupgrade.

  To check everything went fine you can run:
    # perl -Moose\ 999
  and
    # perl -MClass::MOP\ 999
  in both cases you should see output:
  version 999 required--this is only version 2.0007

20110606:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sympa
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Sympa previously used to install to ${PREFIX}/sympa, which goes against
  the general rules for hierarchy. Most files which were previously found
  in ${PREFIX}/sympa should now be found in ${PREFIX}/libexec/sympa.

  Any configuration in httpd.conf files etc will need to be updated to the
  new directory.

  Before upgrade, it is advisable to back up configuration files
  ${PREFIX}/etc/sympa.conf and wwsympa.conf since previous versions wipe these
  out on deinstall.

20110606:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The mariadb port has been split into -client, -scripts, and -server ports

20110529:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/*kmfl*
  AUTHOR: nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net

  KMFL keyboard ports are now shared between IBus and SCIM KMFL IMEngines
  (textproc/ibus-kmfl and textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine). Thus, the prefix
  'scim-' is dropped from keyboard ports names.

  Similar to m17n, both engines now search engine-neutral locations,
  ${LOCALBASE}/share/kmfl/ and ~/.kmfl/. Users have to move their local
  keyboard files from ~/.scim/kmfl/ to ~/.kmfl/.

20110523:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_perl2
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  mod_perl2 was updated to version 2.0.5, this version includes
  p5-Apache-Reload again. The ports p5-Apache-Reload is now marked as
  conflict for mod_perl2.

  To update your mod_perl2 with portmaster use the commands

  # portmaster -o www/mod_perl2 www/p5-Apache-Reload
  # portmaster -R -r mod_perl2

20110522:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: vbox@FreeBSD.org

  The emulators/virtualbox-ose port has been updated to 4.0.8. If you
  want to stay with VirtualBox 3.2.x please run:

  # portmaster -o emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod-legacy emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod
  # portmaster -o emulators/virtualbox-ose-legacy emulators/virtualbox-ose
  or
  # portupgrade -o emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod-legacy emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod
  # portupgrade -o emulators/virtualbox-ose-legacy emulators/virtualbox-ose

  latest legacy version as a fallback if you hit a serious regression
  in the latest version.

20110517:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.14 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.12, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.14):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.14 -f perl-5.12.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.14 lang/perl5.12

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20110516:
  AFFECTS: users of net/skype, net/skype-devel, net-im/skype, net-im/skype-devel
  AUTHOR: Ion-Mihai Tetcu <itetcu@FreeBSD.org>

  All skype ports were moved to net-im/:
  - skype12: unchanged, very old version (for FreeBSD 6)
  - skype20: last version with OSS support, that used to live in net/skype; the
  DISTFILE is gone from the vendor but if you happen to have it, it would be a
  way of having sound w/o needing to upgrade your base OS
  - [RECOMMENDED] skype: currently at 2.1.0.81 and the best supported
  - skype-devel: currently at 2.2.0.25, sounds is OK, video doesn't work

  To run either skype or skype-devel with fully working sound you need:
  - to run fc10 (most probably, please report what you can do with fc4):
  (OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f10,OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f10
  in /etc/make.conf for systems that doesn't have it as default)
  - In order for Skype to work OK, you need your kernel and modules to be:
	- post 2011-05-03 in on HEAD
	- post 2011-05-08 in on 7,8-STABLE
  The port tries to catch if your system version is too old, but there's a
  ~3months window where because of a lack of OSVERSION bump, this is not
  possible. So please check; and PLEASE READ THE PKGMESSAGE for setup details.
  For how to update your kernel/world, see:
  http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html

  IF YOUR OSVERSION IS NOT NEW ENOUGH, SOUND (ESPECIALLY MIC) WON'T WORK.

  If you run into problems, at very least we need to know the output of:
  $ uname -a; sysctl compat.linux | head -2; \
    grep OVERRIDE_LINUX_ /etc/make.conf; \
    cat /compat/linux/etc/alsa/pcm/pcm-oss.conf
  the skype version you are using and hardware details (eg. webcam, if related)
  I most probably will ignore any mail not containing this info since without
  it it's impossible to help.
  Please test your sound /video setup outside skype before blaming skype /
  mailing me.

  AFFECTS: users of audio/musicpd
  AUTHOR: Chris Rees <utisoft@gmail.com>

  Musicpd now installs the binary for the server as bin/musicpd, rather than
  mpd, to remove a conflict with net/mpich2; before upgrade you should run:

  # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/musicpd stop

  Likewise, mpd.conf has been renamed musicpd.conf-- if you want to keep it
  as mpd.conf then place MPDCONF="mpd.conf" into /etc/make.conf, otherwise
  after upgrade run:

  # mv /usr/local/etc/mpd.conf /usr/local/etc/musicpd.conf

20110514:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/gksu, sysutils/libgksu, sysutils/libgksuui

  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  Due to a bug when upgrading from 23.2 or later versions, everything
  installed by other ports in "${PREFIX}/share/emacs" gets removed.

  Before upgrading:

  * Please backup custom configurations in "${PREFIX}/share/emacs".
  * After upgrading reinstall any ports that may have had files in the
    "${PREFIX}/share/emacs" directory.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/ocaml and related libraries/applications
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  Ocaml compiler and libraries suite has been updated to 3.12.
  There appears to be an ABI incompatibility with .cmi files
  generated by previous compiler versions.  Though these should
  only affect the linking process, if some application you're
  using start to misbehave after the lang/ocaml updated you're
  advised to rebuild this applications using the new ocaml version.

  Loginname, path, scripts and config files have been renamed in 4.3.0
  Steps to update:
  1. Stop and deinstall the old version.
  2. Copy the remaining config files to the new location.
  3. Read the instructions
  4. merge your old config with the upgrade430.sh script

20110328:
  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap24-client
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP has been upgraded to 2.4.25.  In this version, certain library
  routines were moved from liblutil to libldap.  If you previously built
  the library with "FETCH" support, this would cause libldap to depend on
  FreeBSD's libfetch.so library.


  As of 20110402, a local change have been introduced so OpenLDAP libraries
  link against libfetch.so when FETCH is enabled.  Normally, no further user
  interaction would be required.

  For new installations, the FETCH option have been turned off by default.

20110324:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.6.1. As usual a number of files were
  moved between packages, manual intervention into update procedure is
  required:

  # pkg_delete -f kdehier4\* kdebase-runtime-4\* kdebase-workspace-4\*
  # pkg_delete -f kdeedu-4\* kdeutils-4\*
  # portmaster -a

20110322:
  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  The www/firefox port has been updated to 4.0. If you want to stay with
  Firefox 3.6 please run:

  # portupgrade -o www/firefox36 www/firefox
  # portupgrade -o www/firefox36-i18n www/firefox-i18n (if installed)
  or
  # portmaster -o www/firefox36 www/firefox
  # portmaster -o www/firefox36-i18n www/firefox-i18n (if installed)

  Do not select the OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS option on a system with less then
  2 GB of RAM otherwise you will run out of memory during the build.

  Please make sure all your addons are compatible with Firefox 4.0 and
  backup your ~/.mozilla directory prior to the first launch of Firefox
  4.0.

  The startup script has been renamed from firefox3 to firefox.

20110319:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-client
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The shared library version of the client library was increased to reflect
  ABI changes, and avoid compatibility problems with the client library
  in MySQL 5.1, so client programs that use the 5.5 client library should
  be recompiled against the 5.5.10 client library.
  This can be achieved with:

  # portmaster -r mysql-client-5.5
  or
  # portupgrade -fr mysql-client-5.5

20110318:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node and www/node-devel
  AUTHOR: araujo@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/node was merged with www/node-devel since there is no longer a
  development version. Also www/node has not followed the stable upstream
  prior to this update.

  To keep www/node updated in your applications, from now on you must use
  www/node instead of www/node-devel. If you have been using the www/node-devel,
  you must run one of the following commands to upgrade:

  # portmaster -o www/node www/node-devel
  or
  # portupgrade -o www/node www/node-devel

20110317:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uzbl
  AUTHOR: Klaus Aehlig <aehlig@linta.de>

  The port has been updated to version as of 2011/02/15. This introduces
  the following incompatabilities.

  - $UZBL_FIFO, $UZBL_TITLE are available to scripts as environment variables,
  but not as command-line arguments.
  - environment variables are no longer expanded by the config parser
  - download handling has changed
  - cookie daemons are no longer supported

  Users are advised to change their personal configuration files/scripts accordingly.

20110316:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/duplicity
  AUTHOR: peter.schuller@infidyne.com

  sysutils/duplicity has been upgraded to 0.6.11. The old version
  (0.5.20) is retained as sysutils/duplicity05. Duplicity 0.6 should
  be generally compatible, but pay special attention to the new meaning
  of the --archive-dir command. In particular, the archive dir is now
  mandatory and defaults to ~/.cache/duplicity. You may have to
  --exclude accordingly.  In addition, it is recommended you consult
  the CHANGELOG, specifically the "New in v0.6.00 (2009/06/08)" section
  which details the checkpoint/restore feature (enabled by default) and
  its implications.

20110313:
  AFFECTS: users of astro/boinc-setiathome-enhanced
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  The setiathome client has been updated to version 6.12.  Before you
  update, finish and report your current workunits to avoid losing them.

20110304:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python* and py-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Python has been changed from 2.6.x to 2.7.x.
  If you have 2.6.x installed, perform an upgrade of lang/python26 to
  lang/python27 with one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python27 lang/python26

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python27 lang/python26

  If you want to retain 2.6.x as default Python version, set the
  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION variable to 'python2.6' (without quotes) in
  /etc/make.conf, then go to lang/python and perform the following
  command:

  # portupgrade -R python

  Once the installed Python has been updated to 2.7, by using the
  method above, it is required to run the upgrade-site-packages target in
  lang/python to assure that site-packages are made available to the new
  Python version.

  If using portupgrade:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  If using portmaster:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages -DUSE_PORTMASTER

  The portmaster case can take quite some time to complete due to the lack of
  cached information that the portupgrade suite uses (specifically pkg_which).
  This is not the fault of portmaster.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/jasperserver
  AUTHOR: jhelfman@experts-exchange.com

  (taken from release notes of 4.0 from vendor)
  If you are upgrading from an older JasperServer version such as 3.5 then
  you must first upgrade to JasperServer 3.7 before upgrading to 4.0.
  Upgrading directly from JasperServer 3.5 to 4.0 is not a "certified"
  (i.e. fully QA tested) procedure.

  The steps to carry out this operation are fully documented in the
  JasperReports Server Installation Guide for the 3.7 release.  You will
  need to download the JasperServer 3.7 release package to get the relevant
  files and documentation. To download the JasperServer 3.7 WAR file
  distribution zip package, go to the JasperForge.org website and to the
  JasperServer project.

  AFFECTS: users of net/unison and net/unison-devel
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.40, which uses a different wire
  protocol than 2.32 did.  In order to support synchronization with
  other computers where Unison is still at version 2.32, a new port
  net/unison232 has been created.  It provides unison232 and if that is
  GTK2-enabled, also unison232-text.  This unison232 port can be
  installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been updated to 5.12.3.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.12.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.12 from lang/perl5.{8,10} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20100715 in this file.

20110124:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  Postfix 2.8 introduces minor incompatibilities with previous versions.
  Alias expansion, dns lookups, TLS support, milters and other features
  are affected.  To avoid surprises, carefully review the RELEASE_NOTES.

  If you upgrade from Postfix 2.6 or earlier, you must execute "postfix
  stop" and "postfix start" before you can use the postscreen(8) daemon.
  This is needed because the Postfix 2.6 "pass" master service type did
  not work reliably on some systems. If you upgrade from Postfix 2.7, or
  from Postfix 2.8 before July 25, 2010, you must "postfix reload" (or
  "postfix stop" followed by "postfix start"). This is needed because
  the queue manager to delivery agent protocol has changed.

  Also note that the optional SPF and VDA patches have not been updated
  for Postfix 2.8; as a result, they are currently disabled.

  AFFECTS: users of www/redmine
  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  If you use 3rd party plugins that are incompatible with i18n >= 0.5.0
  (eg. variables in yml files as {{variable}}) then you need to
  install an older i18n version manually.

  # gem install -v=0.4.2 i18n

  Then upgrade the database as usual:

  # rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim
  AUTHOR: rea@FreeBSD.org

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] The default value for system_filter_user
  is now the Exim run-time user, instead of root.

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY is no longer
  optional and is forced on.  This is mitigated by the new build
  option TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST which defines a list of configuration
  files which are trusted; one per line. If a config file is owned
  by root and matches a pathname in the list, then it may be invoked
  by the Exim build-time user without Exim relinquishing root
  privileges.

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] The Exim user is no longer automatically
  trusted to supply -D<Macro[=Value]> overrides on the command-line.
  Going forward, we recommend using TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST with shim
  configs that include the main config.  As a transition mechanism,
  we are temporarily providing a work-around: the new build option
  WHITELIST_D_MACROS provides a colon-separated list of macro names
  which may be overriden by the Exim run-time user.  The values of
  these macros are constrained to the regex ^[A-Za-z0-9_/.-]*$
  (which explicitly does allow for empty values).

  Upgrading users are encouraged to fully study
    ftp://exim.inode.at/exim/ChangeLogs/NewStuff-4.73
  and
    ftp://exim.inode.at/exim/ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-4.73

  AFFECTS: users of security/libksba
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  libksba has been updated to 1.1.0, and the shared library version has
  increased from .17 to .18.

  Directly- and indirectly-dependent ports have had their PORTREVISION
  bumped to facilitate rebuilding.  Please rebuild the dependent ports
  with your preferred upgrading tool:

	# portupgrade -rf security/libksba
  -or-
	# portmaster -w -r security/libksba

  If there are still ports on your system that require ksba.so.17 (either
  in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg, or non-existent), _please_ file a PR so
  that a correct direct dependency can be added.

  Once you are satisfied that no ports still depend on the old shared
  library version (libksba.so.17), you can safely delete it from the
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg directory if it is present there.

  AFFECTS: autotools
  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  The next stage in the ongoing cleanup of autotools-using ports is
  a refactoring of bsd.autotools.mk so that version numbers are no longer
  needed within the USE_AUTOTOOLS stanza.  There is either
  autoconf213/autoconf or automake14/automake (for the legacy versions,
  and the currently available versions).  This will considerably reduce
  the amount of tree-wide patching in future on an update.

  IMPORTANT: if you have either devel/autoconf-wrapper or
  devel/automake-wrapper installed on your system (and you most likely do)
  PLEASE update these ports to their new versions before updating anything
  else -- Bad Things[tm] are likely to happen otherwise.

  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk, net/asterisk-addons
  AUTHOR: Florian Smeets <flo@smeets.im>

  If you want to upgrade to 1.8.0 first remove asterisk-addons by running

  # pkg_delete -f asterisk-addons\*

  after that you can run one of the following

  # portmaster asterisk
  or
  # portupgrade asterisk

  You need to update your config files as the step from 1.4.x to 1.8.x is
  quite big. First you need to look at what changed between 1.4 and 1.6

  http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.8/UPGRADE-1.6.txt

  After that you also need to take into account what chagne between
  1.6 and 1.8

  http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.8/UPGRADE.txt

  If you want to stay with asterisk 1.4.x please run

  # portmaster -o net/asterisk14 net/asterisk
  # portmaster -o net/asterisk14-addons net/asterisk-addons
  or
  # portupgrade -o net/asterisk14 net/asterisk

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix, mail/postfix2[56]
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  As of Postfix 2.7.2, 2.6.8, 2.5.11:

  Postfix no longer automatically appends the system default CA
  (certificate authority) certificates, when it reads the CA
  certificates specified with {smtp, lmtp, smtpd}_tls_CAfile or
  with {smtp, lmtp, smtpd}_tls_CApath.  This prevents third-party
  certificates from getting mail relay permission with the
  permit_tls_all_clientcerts feature.  Unfortunately, this change
  may cause compatibility problems with configurations that rely
  on certificate verification for other purposes.  To get the old
  behavior, specify "tls_append_default_CA = yes".

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-server
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  If you are upgrading from a previous MySQL release, the server will exit
  during startup after finding that the proxies_priv table is missing.
  To create the table, start the server with the --skip-grant-tables
  option to cause it to skip the normal grant table checks, then run
  mysql_upgrade. Then stop the server and restart it normally.
  You can do this by temporarly setting the following line in rc.conf:

  mysql_args="--skip-grant-tables --skip-networking"

  AUTHOR: wen@FreeBSD.org

  py-bsddb3 update to 5.1.0. This release drops support for Berkeley
  DB 4.1, and adds support for Berkeley DB version 5.1, brand new. If
  you need Berkeley DB 4.1 support, keep using pybsddb 5.0.0. If you

  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster
  AUTHOR: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org>

  The changes to bsd.port.mk in 1.652 require all portmaster users to
  upgrade to version 3.1 or later.  The best method to do this will be
  to use the port, rather than portmaster itself:

  # pkg_delete -f portmaster\*
  # cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster && make clean && make install clean

20101026:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba35
  AUTHOR: Timur Bakeyev <timur@FreeBSD.org>

  This is the latest stable release of the Samba3 distribution. It has
  been extended with the experimental support of the NFS4-like ACLs on
  ZFS partitions, thanks to the sysutils/libsunacl library by Edward
  Tomasz Napierala(trasz). This support haven't been tested thoroughly,
  so try it on your own risk.

  This port reverted back to the pre- net/samba34 layout of the
  directories and now they are again $PREFIX/etc/samba, /var/run/samba,
  /var/log/samba, /var/db/samba and /var/spool/samba respectively.

  In case, you are upgrading from net/samba34, please rename
  corresponding samba34/ subdirectories into samba/ ones. Upgrades from
  older versions of Samba and fresh installations should be seamless.

  Since timestamp format changed you need to use -o option with -d
  option in order to be able to delete old snapshots. Note however that

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  Incompatibility with snapshot 20100912
  ======================================
  - If your DNSBL queries have a "secret" in the domain name, you must
    now censor this information from the postscreen(8) SMTP replies.
  - The postscreen "continue" action is now called "ignore". The old
    name is still supported but no longer documented.
  - The postscreen_hangup_action parameter was removed. Postscreen
    now always behaves as if "postscreen_hangup_action = drop".
  - The postscreen_cache_retention_time default was increased from
    1d to 7d, to avoid deleting results from expensive deep SMTP
    protocol tests too quickly.

  Incompatibility with snapshot 20100827
  ======================================
  - The Postfix SMTP client no longer appends the local domain when
    looking up a DNS name without ".".
    Specify "smtp_dns_resolver_options  = res_defnames" to get the old
    behavior, which may produce unexpected results.

  The p5-Compress-Zlib, p5-IO-Compress-Base, p5-IO-Compress-Zlib and
  p5-IO-Compress-Bzip2 ports have been replaced by p5-IO-Compress.
  Users of Perl 5.10 and higher do not need to install this module
  because it is already included in the standard perl distribution.

  AFFECTS: users of security/stunnel
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  In stunnel-4.34, the DH support is no longer configurable by the user,
  but always enabled when OpenSSL supports it instead.  This means that
  it will now most probably be enabled on the supported versions of FreeBSD.
  If this leads to problems with old SSL clients, I will look into making
  it configurable at build time again.

20100917:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk
  AUTHOR: marius@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/cdrtools-cjk port has been removed, as the required functionality is
  now available in cdrtools 3.0.0 in the standard sysutils/cdrtools port.

 20100915:
  AFFECTS: autoconf, automake
  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  autoconf has been updated from 2.62 to 2.67 -- all ports depending on
  autoconf-2.62 have had their PORTREVISIONs update, so a standard
  port updating method will suffice.

  USE_GETTEXT has been extended to also accept 'build' and 'run' for
  ports which need devel/gettext as a BUILD- or RUN-time dependency only.
  No port should now be directly depending on devel/gettext in Makefiles.

20100915:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk
  AUTHOR: marius@FreeBSD.org

  Version 3.00 of sysutils/cdrtools breaks but at the same time also
  obsoletes sysutils/cdrtools-cjk as mkisofs now employs iconv for
  character conversion. Consequently sysutils/cdrtools-cjk is marked
  BROKEN and the use of USE_CDRTOOLS=cjk as well as USE_CDRTOOLS together
  with the WITH_CJK knob left in a broken state until bsd.port.mk is
  updated by portmgr@ accordingly. Once USE_CDRTOOLS is updated to no
  longer refer to sysutils/cdrtools-cjk the latter will be removed.
  Previous users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk should switch to using
  sysutils/cdrtools instead, which might require not using the WITH_CJK
  knob until said update of bsd.port.mk has happened.

20100915:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been updated to 5.12.2.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.12.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.12 from lang/perl5.{8,10} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20100715 in this file.

20100912:
  AFFECTS: ftp/curl
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  With version 7.21.1, the cURL port is built with stricter compiler
  checking by default (the -Werror flag is passed to the C compiler,
  making it treat any warnings as fatal errors).  If you experience
  problems building cURL, re-run "make config" in the ftp/curl
  directory and disable the WERROR knob.

20100912:
  AFFECTS: www/tdiary-devel, japanese/tdiary-devel

  The default lighttpd configuration file locations have changed.
  The main configuration file is now: $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
  and includes other configuration files from $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/

  For compatibility with old-style configurations, if the lighttpd_conf
  variable is not set in /etc/rc.conf, $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd.conf takes
  precedence over $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

20100815:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/redis and databases/redis-devel
  AUTHOR: osa@FreeBSD.org

  The redis configuration file, redis.conf, have been changed, some options

  AFFECTS: users of textproc/nltk
  AUTHOR: clsung@FreeBSD.org

  Nltk has been upgraded to 2.0b8 which depends on devel/py-yaml now.
  You need to deinstall nltk before upgrading, since the previous port
  will delete files installed from py-yaml during its deinstall phase.

  Use, for example:

    # pkg_delete nltk-2.0b7,1

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.10, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.12):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.12 -f perl-5.10.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.12 lang/perl5.10

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches  more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20100626:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/ibus-mozc
  AUTHOR: daichi@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/ibus-mozc port has been updated to version 0.11.383.102,
  and separated into 5 ports to cope with upcoming new port
  japanese/scim-mozc.

    o japanese/mozc-server
    o japanese/mozc-tool
    o japanese/mozc-additions
    o japanese/ibus-mozc
    o devel/py-gyp-devel

  You can not upgrade with portupgrade or portmaster. To upgrade, you
  must deinstall japanese/ibus-mozc first and then install the new
  japanese/ibus-mozc.

  For example:

    # pkg_delete ja-ibus-mozc-0.11.365.102_1
    # portsnap fetch update

  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The security/libassuan port has been updated to version 2.0.0, and
  the applications listed above have been updated to use it as of versions
  1.1.0 and 2.0.15 respectively.  If you HAVE NOT updated your libassuan
  port as described in the 20100613 entry, you can simply update all 3
  ports together (libassuan, dirmngr if installed, and gnupg) using your
  normal upgrade path.  If you HAVE updated to libassuan-1, then you need
  to do the following before upgrading dirmngr and gnupg.

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o security/libassuan security/libassuan-1

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o security/libassuan libassuan-1

  If you use neither:

	pkg_delete -f libassuan*

  Please note, libassuan version 2.0.0 is now a shared library, so unlike
  the previous version it is now a runtime dependency and cannot be deleted
  after you are done building dirmngr and/or gnupg.

20100613:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kdepim4, and  security/{gpa|opensc}
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The security/libassuan port has been updated to version 2.0.0, however,
  the applications listed above are not yet compatible with it.  Therefore
  security/libassuan-1 has been created until they can be updated, and the
  ports listed above have been updated to depend on it.  You must first
  replace your existing libassuan with version 1 in the new location, then
  you can update the ports listed above normally.

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o security/libassuan-1 security/libassuan

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o security/libassuan-1 libassuan

  If you use neither:

	pkg_delete -f libassuan*

  There are new versions of libogg (1.2.0) and libao (1.0.0) and the
  shared library versions have been bumped (ogg.6 to ogg.7, ao.3 to ao.4).

  All ports that have an identifiable direct dependency on these libraries
  have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.  However, some ports that pull in
  the libraries indirectly may continue to look for the old versions.  To
  ensure that all are updated, perform this step:

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -rf libogg libao

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -r libogg libao

  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  Another version of gettext (0.18), and another shared library version
  bump (from intl.8 to intl.9), so:

  All ports that have an identifiable known direct dependency on gettext
  have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.  If after upgrading:

	# portupgrade -rf gettext
	# portmaster -w -r gettext

  The upgrade of devel/gobject-introspection may fail because it is looking
  for libintl.so.8.  In this case, do the following:

	# cd /usr/ports/devel/gobject-introspection
	# make clean
	# make deinstall
	# make install clean

  Then continue your upgrade procedure normally.

  If there are still ports on your system that are looking for libintl.so.8
  (either in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg, or non-existent), _please_ file
  a PR so that a correct direct dependency can be added.

  Once you are satisfied that no ports still depend on the old versions (such
  as libgettextpo.so.4 and libintl.so.8) you can safely delete them from the
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg directory if they are present there.

    - devel/darcs           -> devel/hs-darcs
    - ports-mgmt/porte      -> ports-mgmt/hs-porte
    - textproc/pandoc       -> textproc/hs-pandoc
    - x11/xmobar            -> x11/hs-xmobar
    - x11-wm/xmonad         -> x11-wm/hs-xmonad
    - x11-wm/xmonad-contrib -> x11-wm/hs-xmonad-contrib

  Please follow these steps below to update Haskell ports that you have
  installed:

  1) Reinstall the renamed Haskell port dependencies (see previous entry).
     Note that this will possibly require that you remove the affected leaf
     (aforementioned) ports as well;

  2) Reinstall the renamed application(s) you use.

  AFFECTS: users of hs-* ports
  AUTHOR: pgj@FreeBSD.org

  The following Haskell ports have been renamed in order to bring them in
  sync with the naming scheme used at HackageDB.  Please follow these steps
  below to update your installation:

  1) Delete the following ports (if you have any of them installed):

     - hs-zip-archive-ghc
     - hs-binary-ghc
     - hs-language-c-ghc
     - hs-lazysmallcheck-c-ghc
     - hs-pcre-light-ghc
     - hs-utf8-string-ghc
     - hs-HGL-ghc
     - hs-digest-ghc
     - hs-haxml

     - hs-opengl-ghc
     - hs-OpenGLRaw-ghc
     - hs-OpenGLURaw-ghc
     - hs-glut-ghc

  2) Rebuild the renamed ports and all ports that depend on them.

20100518:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/pylint
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The pylint user configuration files have been changed slightly in newer
  versions (>=0.20.0).  In some cases, older configurations might crash
  pylint at startup.

  If you run into startup problems, make sure you remove the .pylintrc
  configuration settings and the .pylint.d directory from your home
  directory:

	$ rm ~/.pylintrc
	$ rm -rf ~/.pylint.d

20100518:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr0, devel/apr1, www/apache20, www/apache22
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  devel/apr port has been renamed to devel/apr1.

  WITH_APR_FROM_PORTS=yes for www/apache22 has been dissolved and may be
  removed from your configuration files; devel/apr1 is always used now.

  Please manually delete apache-2.\* if installed _before_ updating using
  either portmaster or portupgrade:

	pkg_delete -f apache-2.\*

  Then, if you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o devel/apr1 devel/apr

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o devel/apr1 devel/apr

  Finally, reinstall Apache port if you deleted it earlier and update ports as
  usual (`XX' below is either 20 or 22):

	portinstall www/apacheXX

20100512:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache20
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  The rc.d script has been renamed:

	apache2.sh -> apache2

  You'll need to update any crons wrappers, etc. for the new paths.

20100511:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated from 4.3.5 to 4.4.3. A number of libraries
  was moved between packages. The recommended update procedure is to delete
  kdelibs-experimental*, kdebase-4*, kdebase-workspace-4*,
  kdebase-runtime-4*, kdepim-4*, kdepim-runtime-4*, and then update ports as
  usual and install desired KDE4 ports:

    # pkg_delete -f kdebase-\*4\* kdepim-\*4\* kdelibs-experimental-\*4\*
    # portmaster -a (or portupgrade -aR)

  In order to enabled Nepomuk semantic desktop search you have to install
  databases/virtuoso (you don't need to manually configure or run virtuoso
  server).

20100511:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/redland RDF engine
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Redland RDF engine has been split into redland itself and rasqal engine.
  The recommended update procedure is to delete redland, then update ports
  as usual and install desired RDF ports:

    # pkg_delete -f redland-\*
    # portmaster raptor (or portupgrade -r raptor)

20100511:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/qt4-phonon, multimedia/qt4-phonon-gst,
	   multimedia/phonon, and multimedia/phonon-gstreamer
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  WITH_QT_PHONON global knob has been introduced to allow selection between
  multimedia/qt4-phonon* ports (a bit outdated Phonon, which is shipped with
  Qt4) and multimedia/phonon* ports.  Since KDE SC 4.4 requires fresh Phonon,
  multimedia/phonon* ports are installed by default.

  If you don't use KDE, you may set WITH_QT_PHONON=yes in /etc/make.conf
  and continue to use Qt4 Phonon implementation ports.

  If you want to use KDE SC 4.4 (or if you want the latest Phonon), do not
  define WITH_QT_PHONON, delete multimedia/qt4-phonon* ports, and install
  multimedia/phonon*:

  If you use portmaster:

    portmaster -o multimedia/phonon multimedia/qt4-phonon
    portmaster -o multimedia/phonon-gstreamer multimedia/qt4-phonon-gst

  If you use portupgrade:

    portupgrade -f -o multimedia/phonon multimedia/qt4-phonon
    portupgrade -f -o multimedia/phonon-gstreamer multimedia/qt4-phonon-gst

20100510:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnome-keyring
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  libgnome-keyring was split out of the gnome-keyring package.  Perform the
  following before doing your normal upgrade steps:

	pkg_delete -f "gnome-keyring-*"
	portmaster security/gnome-keyring
  or
	pkgdb -Ff
	portupgrade -R -x gnome-keyring -x libgnome-keyring gnome-keyring
	pkg_deinstall -fO gnome-keyring
	portinstall security/gnome-keyring

20100506:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/nullmailer on FreeBSD 6.X
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The nullmailer port was recently updated with an rc.d script to correctly
  daemonize nullmailer-send with daemon(8).  On FreeBSD 6.X, daemon(8) does
  not support "[-u user]" command-line switch, causing the nullmailer rc.d
  script failure to start nullmailer-send.

  Support for "[-u user]" command-line switch was recently MFC'd to 6-STABLE
 (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=bin/146266).  FreeBSD 6.X users
  should patch and install daemon(8) by one of the methods described below.

  If /usr/src is not yet populated, csup the 6-STABLE sources and run these
  commands:

    cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/daemon
    make install
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nullmailer start

  If /usr/src is already populated with sources from a previous 6.X release,
  use these commands:

    cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/daemon
    fetch 'http://people.freebsd.org/~glarkin/pr-links/daemon/patch-daemon.c'
    fetch 'http://people.freebsd.org/~glarkin/pr-links/daemon/patch-daemon.8'
    patch -p0 daemon.c < patch-daemon.c
    patch -p0 daemon.8 < patch-daemon.8
    make install
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nullmailer start

20100502:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with squid* the directory containing the default cache and log
  directory was changed from $PREFIX/squid/ to /var/squid/.

  The default values for the following Squid configuration parameters have
  changed as shown below:

  cache_log from $PREFIX/squid/logs/cache.log to /var/squid/logs/cache.log
  cache_store_log from $PREFIX/squid/logs/store.log to /var/squid/logs/store.log
  pid_filename from $PREFIX/squid/logs/squid.pid to /var/squid/logs/squid.pid
  coredump_dir from $PREFIX/squid/cache to /var/squid/cache

  Please check whether you need to define any of these variables in your
  squid.conf to the old defaults explicitly before updating, especially if
  you have set up automated log processing or automated log rotation.  If you
  define pid_filename in your squid.conf, you should also set squid_pidfile
  to the same value in /etc/rc.conf, cf. $PREFIX/etc/rc.d/squid.

20100419:
  AFFECTS: users of math/libgmp4
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default gmp version in FreeBSD is now 5.0.x.  The port directory
  changed from math/libgmp4 to math/gmp.  An entry has been added to MOVED
  and all depending ports revisions have been bumped, so the update should
  be handled correctly by usual port management tools such as portupgrade.

  Portmaster users, please do the following before upgrading ports that
  depend on gmp:

	portmaster -o math/gmp math/libgmp4

20100409:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  As of PHP 5.3, a few extensions were removed from or included into the core
  PHP5 package.  Follow the steps below to update your installation.

  1) Delete the following packages (if installed):

     - php5-dbase
     - php5-ncurses
     - php5-pcre
     - php5-spl
     - php5-ming
     - php5-mhash

  2) Rebuild lang/php5 and all ports that depend on it.

20100403:
  AFFECTS: users of net/dgd
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The kernel library has been separated from the main net/dgd port into its
  own net/dgd-kernel port so that all libraries are on an equal footing.
  This also reflects the split of the kernel library out from the main DGD
  distribution.

  If you wish to continue to use the kernel library you'll need to install
  net/dgd-kernel after updating to dgd-1.4.1_2.

20100330:
  AFFECTS: users of gstreamer-plugins-bad and gstreamer-plugins-good
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  Plugin moved from the -bad port to the -good port.  Please follow the
  instructions below before proceeding with normal update steps.

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster gstreamer-plugins-bad

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -R multimedia/gstreamer-plugins-bad

20100328:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/png
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The PNG library has been updated to version 1.4.1.  Please rebuild all
  ports that depend on it.

  If you use portmaster: make sure you update to portmaster version 2.20 or
  newer, then do:

	portmaster -r png-

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -fr graphics/png

20100221:
  AFFECTS: users of rblibtorrent-devel
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The port name has changed to libtorrent-rasterbar-14.

  If you use portmaster:

    portmaster -o net-p2p/libtorrent-rasterbar-14 net-p2p/rblibtorrent-devel

  If you use portupgrade:

    portupgrade -o net-p2p/libtorrent-rasterbar-14 net-p2p/rblibtorrent-devel

20100216:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bacula-server, sysutils/bacula-client
  AUTHOR: dvl@FreeBSD.org

  Bacula 5.x uses new shared objects which conflict with the shared objects
  from previous versions.  You should delete all existing Bacula packages
  from your system before compiling Bacula 5.x, otherwise you'll encounter
  compilation errors.

	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/bacula-dir stop
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/bacula-sd stop
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/bacula-fd stop
	pkg_delete 'bacula-*'

  After upgrading, remember to run the database upgrade script supplied
  with the port.

20100214:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/roundcube
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  If you switch mail/roundcube to japanese/roundcube, please re-check
  configuration files like ${PREFIX}/www/roundcube/config/main.inc.php.
  At least, please add following settings:

  $rcmail_config['message_charset_languages'] = array('en_US' => 'ISO-8859-1', ...
  $rcmail_config['transfer_encoding_languages'] = array('en_US' => 'quoted-printable', ...

  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox
  AUTHORS: beat@FreeBSD.org, mandree@FreeBSD.org (Java plugin)

  The www/firefox port has been updated to 3.6.  From now on www/firefox
  will contain the most recent version of Firefox.  Older but still
  supported releases will be available in www/firefox3 and www/firefox35.

  In order to update to Firefox 3.6 please delete your older installed
  version of Firefox first and install www/firefox afterwards.  Please
  make sure all your addons are compatible with Firefox 3.6 and backup
  your ~/.mozilla directory prior to the first launch of Firefox 3.6.

  Note that in order to use Java with Firefox 3.6, you need to install
  java/openjdk6, build it with the "WEB" option enabled and use the Iced
  Tea plugin.  To achieve the latter, each user needs to create a
  symlink to the Icedtea plugin as described in the Browsers/Firefox and
  Java[tm] Plugin section in the handbook:

	ln -s /usr/local/openjdk6/jre/lib/IcedTeaPlugin.so \
	$HOME/.mozilla/plugins

20100207:
  AFFECTS: users of Mesa3D libraries and x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  If you want to use Mesa3D 7.6.1 and libdrm 2.4.17 rather than 7.4.4
  and 2.4.12, you must define WITHOUT_NOUVEAU global macro, at least,
  enabled on graphics/libGL*, graphics/libglut, graphics/dri,
  graphics/mesa-demos, and graphics/libdrm.  And please give up using
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau.

  At this time, I cannot enable latest Mesa3D and libdrm, because they
  break xf86-video-nouveau.  But old (current?) Mesa3D and libdrm do not
  break any drivers.

  AMD Radeon HD 2xxx/3xxx/4xxx users: If you use AMD Radeon HD [234]xxx
  series, please define WITHOUT_NOUVEAU global macro.  You can then use
  OpenGL Hardware Accelerator feature on these series.

20100206:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4-devel
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Default configuration file was moved to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/smb4.conf to
  avoid conflicts with the installed net/samba3?.  Also, userland utils
  are not installed by default, which should also help with the parallel
  setup of Samba3 and Samba4.

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 3 and KDE 3
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  When building qt33 and kdelibs3 (at least), while they are installed,
  because of -L/usr/local/lib being passed too soon, the currently installed
  libraries are used instead of the ones from the build.  This makes the
  build fail if you updated any of the libraries these Qt/KDE libraries are
  linked against (e.g. libjpeg).

  For the moment the workaround, when you get to this, is to move the old lib
  out of the way, e.g.:

    mv /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so.old && \
    cd /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/qt33/ && make && \
    mv /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so.old /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so && \
    portmaster -C x11-toolkits/qt33 (or portupgrade -w qt-33\*) ...

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  Default version of Perl was bumped to 5.10.

  If you already have lang/perl5.8 installed, and want to switch to
  lang/perl5.10 please follow instructions in the entry 20090328 in this
  file.

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba34
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  This port was developed with the generous help of Florent Brodin.

  The default passdb backend has been changed to `tdbsam'! That breaks
  existing setups using the `smbpasswd' backend without explicit
  declaration! Please use `passdb backend = smbpasswd' if you would like
  to stick to the `smbpasswd' backend or convert your smbpasswd entries
  using e.g. `pdbedit -i smbpasswd -e tdbsam'.

  The `tdbsam' backend is much more flexible concerning per user
  settings like `profile path' or `home directory' and there are some
  commands which do not work with the `smbpasswd' backend at all.

20100130:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/sdl_mixer and graphics/sdl_image
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The SDL_mixer and SDL_image libraries have new shared library versions.
  Please rebuild all ports that depend on them.

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -r sdl_mixer-
	portmaster -r sdl_image-

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -fr audio/sdl_mixer
	portupgrade -fr graphics/sdl_image

20100125:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/openal and graphics/openal-soft
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The default OpenAL implementation was switched to audio/openal-soft.
  To update all ports correctly, the following steps have to be performed.

	pkg_delete -f openal-\*

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o audio/openal-soft audio/openal
	portmaster -r audio/openal-soft

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -ro audio/openal audio/openal-soft

  If you want to stick with audio/openal, please specify the following ports
  make flag within /etc/make.conf (or an appropriate configuration file for
  your ports):

	WANT_OPENAL=si

20100122:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/policykit and sysutils/polkit
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Due to a recent change in sysutils/policykit, both sysutils/policykit,
  and sysutils/polkit need to be rebuilt, but in a certain order.  First,
  upgrade sysutils/policykit to 0.9_6.  Then, force rebuild and reinstall
  of sysutils/polkit.  If you do not do this, applications which depend
  on polkitd will fail.

20100113:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  Port has been renamed to emulators/virtualbox-ose to reflect that we are
  using the OSE version.  A separate port for the kernel modules has been
  created: emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod.

  Please see http://wiki.freebsd.org/VirtualBox for update instructions.

20100107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  security/openvpn has been moved to security/openvpn20 and upgraded to 2.0.9.
  security/openvpn has been upgraded to 2.1.1, and security/openvpn-devel has
  been removed.

  Regular upgrades of the security/openvpn port should succeed without
  manual intervention, but if you want to stick to openvpn 2.0 or if you
  had been using openvpn-devel, manual intervention is needed, as
  follows:

  If you'd been using the security/openvpn-devel port, please use one of
  these commands for upgrading:

    portmaster -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn security/openvpn-devel

    portupgrade -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn security/openvpn-devel

  If you want to stick to openvpn 2.0, please use one of these two
  upgrade commands:

    portmaster -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn20 security/openvpn

    portupgrade -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn20 security/openvpn

20100106:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/websvn
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default install directory for websvn has changed from
  ${PREFIX}/www/data/websvn to ${PREFIX}/www/websvn.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your settings
  and data, please do the following:

	mv /usr/local/www/data/websvn /usr/local/www

  Then update as usual.

20091227:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/grok
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  The sysutils/grok port has been completely re-written. Configuration files
  will need to be reviewed. Also, the RC script has been removed until it can
  be made to work with the new version.

20091226:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/ndoutils
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading you'll need to run ./upgradedb; see UPGRADING file.

20091214:
  AFFECTS: users of net/grdc
  AUTHOR: avl@FreeBSD.org

  Grdc has been renamed to Remmina upstream, and the port was also renamed
  to reflect this.  After installing remmina port you will need to download
  the ``grdc2remmina.sh'' script and run it as your normal user(s) that
  have ~/.grdc.  The script will only create ~/.remmina directory and move
  grdc config files to the new path; it does not affect anything else.

	$ fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~avl/script/grdc2remmina.sh
	$ sh grdc2remmina.sh

20091213:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/zabbix, net-mgmt/zabbix-agent
  AUTHOR: Jim Riggs <ports@christianserving.org>

  In order to simplify configuration and better separate the different
  components of Zabbix, the former zabbix port has been split into three:
  zabbix-server, zabbix-proxy, and zabbix-frontend.  Each component has
  distinct functionality and may be installed independently on separate
  systems.  The existing zabbix-agent port remains.

  Additionally, the new zabbix-frontend port now (correctly) installs the
  PHP frontend in PREFIX/www/zabbix.  The old zabbix port installed the
  files in PREFIX/share/zabbix/php.  Web server configurations must be
  updated accordingly.

  Finally, Zabbix has been updated to version 1.8.  Not everyone may be
  able to upgrade from version 1.6 immediately, though, so 1.6.8 versions
  of the ports are also available as zabbix16-server, zabbix16-proxy,
  zabbix16-agent, and zabbix16-frontend.

20091206:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 0.11.1, which no longer enables kqemu by
  default (if built with KQEMU knob on), now you also have to explicitly
  pass -enable-kqemu (or -kernel-kqemu as with the previous versions)
  if you want to use it.  Also note the 0.11 stable branch is the last
  qemu branch that still supports kqemu, so if you depend on reasonably
  fast emulation on FreeBSD you should start looking for alternatives
  some time soon.  (VirtualBox?)

20091120:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfixadmin
  AUTHOR: Terry Sposato <tabmow@freenode.net>

  Due to a bug in the previous postfixadmin port, existing users need to
  backup their config.inc.php before they upgrade to postfixadmin-2.3 or
  later and put it in place after the upgrade is complete.

20091120:
  AFFECTS: users of security/f-prot
  AUTHOR: Tim Bishop <tdb@FreeBSD.org>

  The main f-prot command is now named fpscan.  Virus definitions are
  updated using the fpupdate command.  fpupdate will automatically run
  from periodic every day.  To disable set the following option in
  /etc/periodic.conf:

	fpupdate_enable="NO"

  The f-prot port now only works on i386.

20091118:
  AFFECTS: users of java/jboss5
  AUTHOR: Jonathan Chen <jonc@chen.org.nz>

  The JBoss directory structure has been reorganised to follow hier(7)
  guidelines more closely; in particular, transient and deployment files
  were moved to /var/jboss5, thus allowing /usr to be read-only.

20091118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/redmine
  AUTHOR: Bernhard Froehlich <decke@bluelife.at>

  After the upgrade you need to generate a session secret before restarting
  the application.  This is to protect you from cross-site request forgery.
  From your Redmine directory, simply run the following command once:

	# rake config/initializers/session_store.rb

  then upgrade as usual:

	# rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

20091114:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/win4bsd
  AUTHOR: Mario S F Ferreira <lioux@FreeBSD.org>

  The new port now depends on emulators/kqemu-kmod instead of installing
  its own version.  Therefore, you should make sure that no other kqemu.ko
  modules are installed:

	# pkg_delete -f win4bsd\*
  	# rm -f /boot/kernel/kqemu.ko
  	# pkg_delete -f kqemu-kmod\*
  	# portinstall emulators/win4bsd

  Do not forget to enable kqemu on rc.conf since win4bsd will not work
  without it.

20091018:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql54-server
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  After the upgrade the server may fail to start due to changes in the
  default values of innodb_log_files_in_group and innodb_log_file_size,
  which differ from those in earlier 5.4 releases.

  You should discard the old InnoDB log files and let MySQL 5.4.3 create
  new ones.  It is necessary to shut down your current server cleanly so
  that no outstanding transaction information remains in the log.

  See here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.4/en/news-5-4-3.html

  AFFECTS: users of mail/heirloom-mailx
  AUTHOR: Alexander Logvinov <avl@FreeBSD.org>

  Since SourceForge switched to the new File Release System,
  mail/heirloom-mailx has wrong package name.  All users who have
  mail/heirloom-mailx installed after 22 August 2009 should run the
  following commands:

	# pkg_delete "\-mailx-12.4_1"
  or

  AFFECTS: users of archivers/lzmautils, archivers/lzmautils-devel
  AUTHOR: Christian Weisgerber <naddy@FreeBSD.org>

  The XZ Utils distribution has superseded LZMA Utils, so the xz port has
  been added and the lzmautils ports have been removed.  To perform the
  move, run one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:

	# portupgrade -o archivers/xz lzmautils\*

  If using portmaster:

	# portmaster -o archivers/xz archivers/lzmautils
  or
	# portmaster -o archivers/xz archivers/lzmautils-devel

  as applicable.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-postfwd
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@tandon.net>

  The recipient rate-limiting feature is now called via rcpt() command
  instead of with mrcpt() as in previous versions.  Make sure to update
  your postfwd.conf if you use this feature.

  AFFECTS: users of www/epiphany, x11/yelp, graphics/librsvg2,
	   x11/toolkits/py-gnome-extras, and www/epiphany-extensions
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The default Gecko provider has been changed from www/firefox to
  www/libxul.  Firefox 2.x is now marked FORBIDDEN for security reasons,
  and libxul is new, stable, and preferred Gecko provider.  Libxul uses
  the same Gecko engine as Firefox 3.0.x.

  Some ports may fail to upgrade or run when both www/firefox and libxul
  are installed on the same system.  To make sure everything runs smoothly,
  uninstall www/firefox, then install libxul, then upgrade the affected
  ports.

  will now use lang/gcc44 as the default compiler.

20090911:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.10
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.10 has been updated to 5.10.1.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.10.  Please see its
  manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.10 from lang/perl5.8 please follow
  instructions in the entry 20090328 in this file.

  AFFECTS: users of gstreamer-plugins-bad gstreamer-plugins-good
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  Due to the move of several plugins from gstreamer-plugins-bad to
  gstreamer-plugins-good, it is necessary to update gstreamer-plugins-bad
  first:

	portupgrade -R gstreamer-plugins-bad

  After this step, the normal upgrade procedure can be used.

20090831:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/linux-systemsimcell
  AUTHOR: stast@bsdportal.ru

  The port emulators/linux-systemsimcell has been updated to 3.1.25.
  Systemsimcell emulator now has a new dependency: x11-toolkits/linux-f10-blt.
  So you need to switch to linux-f10 ports in order to use 3.1.25 version.

20090828:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot and mail/dovecot-sieve
  AUTHOR: yds@CoolRat.org

  AFFECTS: users of astro/celestia and KDE
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  Celestia can now be compiled with KDE3 frontend (you can enable it with
  CELESTIA_UI=kde when building).  It is very feature-rich, as it offers
  contextual menus, toolbars, KDE integration, internationalization,
  bookmarks, etc.  If you use Celestia and KDE as your desktop, you might
  want to rebuild the port so it integrates into your environment better.

20090815:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  Dovecot has been updated to version 1.2.3.  The configuration file has

20090804:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon*, x11/kdebase4*, deskutils/kdepim4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE4 has been updated to version 4.3.0.  KDE now uses qt4-phonon;
  multimedia/phonon and multimedia/phonon-gstreamer are deprecated in
  favor of their qt4 equivalents.  You can still use multimedia/phonon-xine
  however.  A number of files have been moved between packages.  The
  recommended update procedure is to delete phonon, phonon-gstreamer,
  kdebase-*4*, kdepim-4*, then update ports as usual and install desired
  KDE4 ports:

    # pkg_delete -f phonon-4\* phonon-gstreamer\* kdebase-\*4\* kdepim-4\*
    # portmaster -a (or portupgrade -a)
    # cd ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde4 && make config && make install clean

20090804:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/dbus-qt4, devel/qt4-designer
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Qt4 ports have been updated to 4.5.2.  The recommended update procedure
  is to delete qt4-dbus and qt4-designer, then update ports as usual.
  Install qt4-designer if needed.

20090802:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libtool15 and devel/libltdl15
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/libtool15 and devel/libltdl15 ports have been moved to libtool22
  and libltdl22, respectively, then updated to 2.2.6a. You will need to run
  portmaster or portupgrade to properly perform the upgrade:

  If using portmaster:

	portmaster -o devel/libtool22 devel/libtool15
	portmaster -o devel/libltdl22 devel/libltdl15

  If using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o devel/libtool22 libtool-1.5\*
	portupgrade -o devel/libltdl22 libltdl-1.5\*

  After that, you will need to rebuild all ports that depend on libltdl.
  Since all dependent ports' PORTREVISIONs have been bumped, you can run
  portupgrade or portmaster with `-a' option to complete the upgrade.

20090801:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  An updated libdrm and xf86-video-nouveau have been committed.  These
  update the API version to 0.0.14 and if you are using DRM you will need
  to update your kernel patch.  See pkg-message in xf86-video-nouveau for
  details.

  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap24-{client,server}
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP has been upgraded to 2.4.17, which requires a shared library
  version bump.  Therefore, you need to reinstall all ports that depend on
  it.  Please do something like:

20090618:
  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-Catalyst
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Most applications and plugins should run unaltered on Catalyst 5.80.

  However, a lot of refactoring work has taken place, and several changes
  have been made which could cause incompatibilities. If your application
  or plugin is using deprecated code, or relying on side effects, then you
  could have issues upgrading to this release.

  The multimedia/mlt++ port was incorporated into multimedia/mlt since
  version 0.4.2.  Delete multimedia/mlt++ first and then install/update
  multimedia/mlt.

20090613:
  AFFECTS: users of www/hudson
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  Hudson is now running as a standalone process and no longer relies on
  Apache Tomcat.  As such, it should now be configured by defining
  hudson_* variables in rc.conf.  See comments from rc.d script for further
  details.

  The default setup is using the same port numbers and HTTP URL prefix as
  before in order to reduce the effort of upgrading the port.  Hence, it
  may conflict with some running Apache Tomcat instance.  To fix this
  problem, you may either deinstall www/tomcat6, or use the following
  settings in hudson_args from /etc/rc.conf:

    --httpPort=??? --ajp13Port=???

20090611:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Two rc.d scripts have been renamed:

	apache22.sh -> apache22
	htcacheclean.sh -> htcacheclean

  You'll need to update any crons wrappers, etc. for the new paths.

20090608:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python* and py-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Python has been changed from 2.5.x to 2.6.x.
  If you have 2.5.x installed, perform an upgrade of lang/python25 to
  lang/python26 with one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python26 lang/python25

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python26 lang/python25

  If you want to retain 2.5.x as default Python version, set the
  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION variable to 'python2.5' (without quotes) in
  /etc/make.conf, then go to lang/python and perform the following
  command:

  # portupgrade -R python

  Once the installed Python has been updated to 2.6, by using the
  method above, it is required to run the upgrade-site-packages target in
  lang/python to assure that site-packages are made available to the new
  Python version.

  If using portupgrade:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  If using portmaster:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages -DUSE_PORTMASTER

  The portmaster case can take quite some time to complete due to the lack of
  cached information that the portupgrade suite uses (specifically pkg_which).
  This is not the fault of portmaster.

20090606:
  AFFECTS: users of java/eclipse
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The update to 3.4.2 changes the location of the metadata for eclipse to
  be more in line with what is used on other platforms.  This means that
  after the update plugins that have been installed by a user with the
  built in Update Manager will need to be reinstalled.

20090605:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  Version 2.6.1 introduced a POLA violation by expecting aliases.db to be
  in /etc/mail/aliases.db (not /etc/aliases.db).  With this version the
  location is reverted to the right place.

  If you updated your installation to 2.6.1 you need to run newaliases(1)
  again after you installed 2.6.2.

20090603:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/font-mplus-ipa (and old japanese/ipa-ttfonts)
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  IPAUIGothic has been updated to a version included in IPA font
  version 002.03 and added as a separated port
  "japanese/font-ipa-uigothic".  And the font-mplus-ipa has been
  updated to remove the old IPAUIGothic.

  Thus the old ipa-ttfonts is almost equivalent to font-ipa +
  font-ipa-uigothic + font-mplus-ipa.  Note that these three packages
  have different licenses from each other.

20090601:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/cvs-devel
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  cvs-devel no longer installs /bin/cvs and /bin/cvsbug. These are now
  installed into ${PREFIX}/bin. If you wish to use these please be aware
  of this change with respect to your path.

20090531:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/viewvc
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  viewvc.conf and templates are not compatible to 1.0.x version, even the
  database scripts have changed.  For details see:

  http://viewvc.tigris.org/source/browse/*checkout*/viewvc/trunk/docs/upgrading-howto.html

20090530:
  AFFECTS: users of Japanese and Chinese fonts
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Ports for Japanese fonts have been reorganized in the following way:

	japanese/ipa-ttfonts -> japanese/font-mplus-ipa
	japanese/ipa-ttfonts -> japanese/font-ipa
	japanese/kochi-ttfonts -> japanese/font-kochi
	japanese/mplusfonts -> japanese/font-mplus
	japanese/sazanami-ttf -> japanese/font-sazanami
	japanese/shinonome -> japanese/font-shinonome
	japanese/umefont -> japanese/font-ume
	japanese/vlgothic -> japanese/font-vlgothic

  While basically these are port name changes for consistency,
  installation directories are also changed:

	font files -> ${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}/*
	symlinks -> ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/{TTF,OTF,fontname,...}/*
	symlinks -> ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/{TTF,OTF,misc,fontname,...}/*

  A user-visible one is that the directory name "TrueType" is replaced
  with "TTF".

  Also, japanese/font-std and chinese/font-std have been added as
  standard fonts used in the Ports Collection.  Currently they
  contain:

	std.ja_JP/Mincho
	std.ja_JP/Gothic
	std.ja_JP/Ryumin-Light
	std.ja_JP/GothicBBB-Medium
	std.zh_CN/STHeiti-Regular
	std.zh_CN/STSong-Light
	std.zh_CN/MSung-Light
	std.zh_CN/MHei-Medium

  under ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/.  They are just symlinks to
  corresponding font files.  The symlink names are based on popular
  PostScript font names.

  Applications should refer the font files via XLFD or fontconfig
  first.  If they need a direct reference to the font file, please use
  files in std.*/*.  This is because direct reference to a specific
  font name in an application configuration file makes the maintenance
  difficult when the font file name is changed, for example.

20090516:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/viewvc
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  OPTION APACHE2 has been changed to APACHE (WITH_APACHE)
  WITH_APACHE2 is deprecated and is being removed.
  APACHE_PORT will be pulled in when WITH_APACHE is selected

20090516:
  AFFECTS: users of print/cups-base and portupgrade
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The print/cups port has been split into multiple ports.  If upgrading
  from 1.3.10_1 and below, you must remove the installed version first.

20090412:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/bacula-server
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/bacula-server now uses a new catalog format.  If upgrading
  from the old version please use the update_bacula_tables script
  provided with the port before restarting bacula.

20090410:
  AFFECTS: users of www/trac-email2trac
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  bin/email2trac.py and bin/delete_spam.py are now installed without the
  .py extension to make the suid run_email2trac work and match the online
  documentation.  If you were using them in scripts or alias entries, you
  will need to update paths accordingly.

20090401:
  AFFECTS: users of Fedora 8 Linux infrastructure ports
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  ATTENTION! Those ports are not default for any version of FreeBSD for now
  and may be used with FreeBSD versions 7.2 and above (8-CURRENT is better)
  using compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 and linux_base-f8. Please, note that
  2.6.16 is not fully supported on 7.x (ex., some syscalls are missing
  and cannot be MFCed due to a native FreeBSD ABI breakage).

  For more information about transition please read item "20070327: AFFECTS:
  users of emulators/linux_base-fc6". That note may be used for upgrading
  to linux_base-f8 and Fedora 8 Linux infrastructure ports as well.

  If you want to switch to linux-f8 ports, please define at /etc/make.conf:

	OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f8
	OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f8

20090328:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.10 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.8, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.10):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.10 -f perl-5.8.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portmaster -o lang/perl5.10 lang/perl5.8
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches  more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20090327:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  After version 0.95 clamav-milter does not accept parameters by command
  line.  If you are using $clamav_milter_flags on rc.conf to set its
  parameters you will need to move to new ${PREFIX}/etc/clamav-milter.conf.

20090319:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash3
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  With the addition of shells/bash version 4.x, people wanting to stick
  with bash 3.x should perform the following update:

	$ portupgrade -f -o shells/bash3 bash

20090318:
  AFFECTS: users of www/suphp
  AUTHOR: yzlin@cs.nctu.edu.tw

  The suPHP port has been upgraded to 0.7.x. This new version of suPHP has
  some new features and changes for the configuration file:

    - Multiple path (with patterns) & variable substitution support for
      docroots
    - Double-quoted strings at section '[handlers]'
      ex. application/x-httpd-php="php:/usr/local/bin/php-cgi"

  These changes may lead to internal server error if without modifications
  of the configuration file from previous version.

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of www/geeklog
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  To follow the standards this port has received a small reworking.

  WWW_DIR (that defaulted to PREFIX/www/data/geeklog) is deprecated,
  use WWWDIR (defaults to PREFIX/www/geeklog).

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: skylord@linkline.ru

  ejabberd's UID and GID have changed (PR ports/105122). Users are advised
  to check all configuration files and data in /var/spool/ejabberd to
  ensure everything has the correct owner/group.

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/lire
  AUTHOR: edwin@FreeBSD.org

  Lire now requires DBD::SQLite, which uses SQLite 3.0.  This means that the
  Lire database format has changed.  If you have one or more old Lire stores,
  you will need to convert each of them from SQLite2 format to SQLite3 like
  this:

	$ sqlite oldstore.db .dump | sqlite3 newstore.db

  This assumes that you have both SQLite2 and SQLite3 installed on your
  system, and that the names of the command line interface for the old and
  new version are `sqlite' and `sqlite3' respectively (this is at least
  correct for Fedora).

20090310:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mythtv
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The upgrade from version 0.20 to version 0.21 should be transparent.
  Any changes to the database structure should be applied automatically.

  However, it is strongly recommended that you back up your database before
  installing a new version of MythTV.

  For example:

	$ mysqldump -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -c > mythtv_backup.sql

  To restore (assuming that you've dropped the database):

	$ mysql -u root
	mysql>create database mythconverg;
	mysql>exit
	$ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < mythtv_backup.sql

20090309:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libusb on CURRENT
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  FreeBSD libusb20 was renamed to libusb in r189585 and thus, being fully
  compatible with libusb20, replaces devel/libusb on HEAD.  devel/libusb
  should not be used on these systems.  Users of libusb-dependent ports
  are advised to remove libusb package from their systems, and rebuild all

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/phonon port has been split into phonon itself, phonon-xine,
  and phonon-gstreamer backends.  After updating phonon port you have
  to install at least one backend; phonon-xine backend is recommended
  for KDE.

20090308:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 0.10.0, which now uses the newer
  (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade emulators/qemu
  with the KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20090304:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/py-gammu
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  The port comms/py-gammu was incorporated into comms/gammu since
  1.23.0. Delete comms/py-gammu first and then deinstall/reinstall
  comms/gammu with option WITH_PYTHON_GAMMU=YES.

20090304:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xfce4
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading from Xfce 4.4 to 4.6 make sure you uninstall the following
  ports:

	x11/libxfce4mcs
	sysutils/xfce4-mcs-manager
	sysutils/xfce4-mcs-plugins
	x11-themes/xfce4-icon-theme

  You may uninstall them before you start the upgrade procedure (preferred)
  or even afterwards when the upgrade went fine.

  Please also note that Xfce 4.6 does not come with an icon theme any more.
  Xfce 4.6 now depends on the Tango theme which is now installed by default.
  The default installation of Xfce is also adjusted to use this icon theme
  instead of the Xfce 4.4 standard Rodent theme.  If you are upgrading from
  Xfce 4.4 to 4.6 you probably still have the Rodent theme selected.  This
  will lead to several "missing" icons when starting up Xfce.

  Make sure to switch as well to the Tango theme.  To do this just open the
  Settings Manager and select Appearance.  Inside the Appearance dialog
  switch to the Icons tab and select the "Tango" entry in the list on the
  left side of the Icons tab.

  For enabling the Reboot/Shutdown functionality of Xfce's logout dialog
  please read the note which gets printed out after the installation of
  x11-wm/xfce4 about how to configure PolicyKit.

  AFFECTS: users of Tcl/Tk
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Tcl/Tk has been changed from 8.4 to 8.5.

  To restore old behavior and prefer using Tcl 8.4 with supported ports set
  WITH_TCL_VER=84 in /etc/make.conf. This has no effect on ports that have
  USE_TCL=yes or USE_TK=yes. They stick to the new default version and have
  to be updated by their maintainers to support other versions than default.

20090218:
  AFFECTS: users of www/zend-framework
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was fixed in Zend Framework
  1.7.5. The LFI was present in the Zend_View::render() method, and
  allowed inclusion of scripts with relative path names, e.g.
  "../../../my/script/dir/myscript.php".

  If the script path name is hard-coded into the application and is not
  generated by user input, the vulnerability does not apply.  Because of
  this exception, the Zend Framework team has added a flag to disable
  the LFI protection in the render() method.

  Full details of the vulnerability, whether it applies to your
  application and how to disable the LFI protection in the render()
  method can be found here:

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon, x11/kdelibs4, x11/kdebase4*,
  deskutils/kdepimlib4, deskutils/kdepim4, devel/automoc4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE4 has been updated from 4.1.4 to 4.2.0.  A number of applications
  have been moved between packages.  The easiest way to avoid various
  problems during update is to delete all KDE-4.1.4 ports and install
  KDE-4.2.0:

	# pkg_delete -f kde\*4.1.4\* automoc4-\*
	# portmaster -a (or portupgrade -a)
	# cd ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde4 && make config && make install clean

20090207:

  devel/libslang has been removed in favor of devel/libslang2 after not
  being released during last five years.  WITH_SLANG2 is no longer a
  valid ports KNOB.  All ports that depend on devel/libslang should be
  recompiled, e.g.:

  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/hal has been updated and should now properly detect mice for

  users and moused should now work fine.

20090123:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  If you are using an older xorg.conf several config lines are no longer
  needed and will generate warnings when X is started.  RgbPath will cause
  X to fail to start, remove it from your config.

  Server 1.5.3 also really wants to configure its input devices via hald.
  This is causing some issues with moused and /dev/sysmouse.  There are
  couple of options for how to deal with it:

  1. Add Option "AllowEmptyInput" "off" to your ServerLayout section.
     This will cause X to use the configured kbd, mouse, and vmmouse
     sections from your xorg.conf

  2. Don't use moused.  If you want it to work with addon USB mice
     set this in rc.conf:

	moused_enable="NO"
	moused_nondefault_enable="NO"

  I'm working on fixing hald or the mouse driver or both.

20090123:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/libxcb
  AUTHOR: flz@FreeBSD.org

  Libxcb shared library version was bumped from 1 to 2.  You need to

  AFFECTS: users of mail/claws-mail, mail/claws-mail-smime
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The claws-mail port includes the S/MIME plugin itself now, it is not
  distributed as a separate plugin anymore. It can be enabled with the
  GPGME option in the port (disabled by default). If you use the S/MIME
  plugin, you should remove the mail/claws-mail-smime port before
  enabling GPGME and updating the mail/claws-mail port. People which
  already updated mail/claws-mail with GPGME enabled and a non-working
  S/MIME plugin need to deinstall mail/claws-mail-smime and reinstall
  mail/claws-mail.

20090118:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Deluge has been updated from 0.5.x to 1.x. The 1.x has been rewritten,
  so it is recommend for you to make the back up of your ~/.config/deluge. The
  configuration and plugins of 0.5.x do not work in 1.x. Deluge will picking
  up the old configuration and try to convert it to the newer format, but I
  wouldn't trust it to do it without the back up.

  If you prefer to stick with 0.5.x, you can use portmaster:

  	# portmaster -o net-p2p/deluge05 net-p2p/deluge

  or if you use portupgrade:

	# portupgrade -o net-p2p/deluge05 net-p2p/deluge

  AFFECTS: users of GNOME and GTK+
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.24.x.  You have to deinstall a few ports
  first before using portupgrade or portmaster in order to successfully
  upgrade your GNOME installation.  After successful upgrade, you have
  to reinstall gnome-session so the gnome.desktop session file is properly
  installed.

  Portupgrade users:

	# pkgdb -Ff
	(Answer "yes" to unregister gail while keeping gtk20.)
	(Answer "yes" to unregister fast-user-switch-applet while
	 keeping gdm.)

	# pkg_deinstall -fO gtkmm-2.12\*

  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  claws-mail has been updated to 3.7.0, with this update OpenSSL support
  has been removed by upstream in favour of GnuTLS.  GnuTLS is now enabled
  by default.  Themes were have also been split to an extra port which
  your can find under x11-themes/claws-mail-themes.  Menu was rewritten
  entirely in version 3.6.0 using modern GTK interface; as a consequence,
  all your custom shortcuts will be lost after upgrade.

20090109:
  AFFECTS: users of any Mozilla and Opera products
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Java plugins now will no longer be picked up by automatically from
  these browsers.  Because all Java ports share the name of plugins file,
  I am thinking about someone or maybe me will need to write something
  similar to nspluginwrapper (but in shell script) that can add Java plugin
  in ~/.*/plugins/ when user requests one specific version of Java plugin
  if this user has more than one version of Java installed.  However, for
  now, you will have to add Java plugin in ~/.*/plugins/ manually.

20090107:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/unixODBC
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/unixODBC port has been updated to 2.2.14.  While
  containing many bug fixes and minor feature adjustments, this version
  no longer ships with the (obsolete) MySQL ODBC driver.  MySQL ODBC
  driver users will probably want to use databases/mysql-connector-odbc
  instead.  The text-backed/flatfile driver (libtxtodbc) has also been
  removed by the developers but due to some demand may make a return in
  a future version or as a separate port.

  to communicate the server by default.  If $JSERVER environment
  variable is defined, the value is used as the server host name.  In
  In short, the server name is determined in the following way:

  $JSERVER --(if null)--> CcWnn.Jserver --(if null)--> "localhost"

  If the server host name is null or matches "^unix$", unix domain
  socket is used.  Note that the default server name in CcWnn.Jserver
  is "unix" now.

  As of PHP 5.2.7, pcre extension is distributed with the core PHP5 package,
  and not as a standalone module anymore.  Follow the steps below to update
  your installation.

  Portupgrade users:

	pkg_delete -f php5-pcre-5.2.6
	pkgdb -F
	portupgrade as usual

  Portmaster users:

	pkg_delete -f php5-pcre\*
	portmaster php5

  If you are using pecl ports you might need to force an update on them:

	portupgrade -f pecl\*
  or
	portmaster pecl

  If you have the pecl hash, json and/or zip extensions you need to replace
  them with the PHP5 bundled ones, e.g.:

	portmaster/portupgrade -o archivers/php5-zip archivers/pecl-zip
	portmaster/portupgrade -o devel/php5-json devel/pecl-json
	portmaster/portupgrade -o security/php5-hash security/pecl-hash

  If you build your INDEX locally and you tried to build it after the PHP
  update commit, you need to rebuild it _after_ you updated lang/php5:

	cd /usr/ports && make index

  or (if you use ports-mgmt/p5-FreeBSD-Portindex):

  AFFECTS: users of www/codeigniter
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  For certain installations, the following steps should be performed
  after the CodeIgniter 1.7.0 upgrade (taken from:
  http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/upgrade_170.html).

  >>> Update your Session Table

  If you are using the Session class in your application, AND if you
  are storing session data to a database, you must add a new column
  named user_data to your session table. Here is an example of what
  this column might look like for MySQL:

	user_data text NOT NULL

  To add this column you will run a query similar to this:

	ALTER TABLE `ci_sessions` ADD `user_data` text NOT NULL

  You'll find more information regarding the new Session functionality
  in the Session class page:

	http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html

  >>> Update your Validation Syntax

  This is an optional, but recommended step, for people currently
  using the Validation class. CI 1.7 introduces a new Form Validation
  class (http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/form_validation.html)
  which deprecates the old Validation library. We have left the old one
  in place so that existing applications that use it will not break, but
  you are encouraged to migrate to the new version as soon as possible.
  Please read the user guide carefully as the new library works a little
  differently, and has several new features.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/sj3-server
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The sj3serv daemon in japanese/sj3-server port now uses "localhost"
  as the default listen address for security reason.  If you need
  the wildcard address (INADDR_ANY), you have to explicitly set
  "servername" to 0.0.0.0 in ${PREFIX}/etc/sj3/serverrc.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3 port have been split into
  japanese/canna-server and japanese/canna-lib, and japanese/sj3-server
  and japanese/sj3-lib, respectively for more fine-grained dependency
  management in the Ports Collection.

20080926:

  The Squid developers decided to disable COSS support in 3.0, cf.
  the discussion starting here:

	http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-dev/200809/0067.html

  The corresponding port configuration option WITH_SQUID_COSS is still
  available but is a no-op for now.  If you currently use COSS storage with
  Squid 3.0 you need to disable it in squid.conf.

20080924:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  proftpd now stores its .delay and .scoreboard files in /var/run/proftpd
  instead of /var/run.  If you are updating an existing installation,
  adjust the following in /usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf:

	ScoreboardFile	/var/run/proftpd/proftpd.scoreboard

  Also of note: The third party modules, mod_codeconv, mod_comb, and
  mod_sql_tds are not compatible with this release and have been removed.
  They will be re-added when the respective authors provide updated versions.

20080909:
  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  logcheck now stores its configuration files in /usr/local/etc/logcheck
  instead of /usr/local/etc.  If you are upgrading the port from version
  1.1.1 to version 1.2.54, copy the following files to a temporary location,
  in case they are removed during the upgrade:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.hacking
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.ignore
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations.ignore

  e.g.:

	cd /usr/local/etc
	mkdir /tmp/logcheck.saveconf
	cp logcheck.hacking logcheck.ignore logcheck.violations* \
	   /tmp/logcheck.saveconf

  After the upgrade, integrate your local changes to the files listed
  above into the new configuration files found in the following directories:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/cracking.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.paranoid
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.workstation
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.ignore.d

  Please consult the following files for more information about
  logcheck rules and reporting levels:

	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck
	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck-database

  Also note that the upgraded port installs a crontab file for user
  "logcheck" that executes the logcheck script every hour and emails
  the results to root.  If the installation process cannot install

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nagios and net-mgmt/nagios-devel
  AUTHOR: Jarrod Sayers <jarrod@netleader.com.au>

  The stable Nagios port has now been updated to version 3.0.3.  Upgrading
  to this version shouldn't require any configuration changes, but note that
  most sample configuration files were moved into objects/ directory.

  Nagios 2.12 is still available as net-mgmt/nagios2, use the following to
  remain on this legacy stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  Nagios 3.x development continues in net-mgmt/nagios-devel, users of this
  port in production use should consider switching to the stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

  AFFECTS: users of math/ploticus
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  This is a major update.

  Deprecated: server-side image maps (use client-side instead); definition
  of categories within proc areadef (use proc categories instead); proc print.

  Discontinued attributes: proc processdata's stack; proc usedata's element,
  proc getdata's rotate, and proc defineunits (use the $changeunits()
  function instead).

  proc rangebar has been renamed proc boxplot and there are major
  functionality changes.  Any script that uses proc rangebar will need
  maintenance.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/pine4 and editors/pico
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  These two ports have been removed in favor of the new mail/alpine and
  editors/pico-alpine ports.  UW discontinued work on Pine in September
  2005 and is focusing on Alpine now.  You should be able to directly
  replace pine with alpine.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  With the default Makefile settings, most of the programs are now
  installed outside your $PATH, except for "git", "gitk", and some server
  side programs that need to be accessible for technical reasons.  Invoking
  a git subcommand as "git-xyzzy" from the command line has been deprecated
  since early 2006 (and officially announced in 1.5.4 release notes); use
  of them from your scripts after adding output from "git --exec-path" to
  the $PATH is still supported in this release, but users are again
  strongly encouraged to adjust their scripts to use "git xyzzy" form, as
  we will stop installing "git-xyzzy" hardlinks for built-in commands in
  later releases.

  www/rt38 among possibly other ports.

20080820:
  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: pneumann@gmail.com

  The database schema has changed in this version of RabbitMQ.  If you
  attempt to start RabbitMQ-1.4.0 over top of a previous installation,
  it will fail, citing "schema_integrity_check_failed".  To correct this,
  delete your mnesia directory (/var/db/rabbitmq/mnesia) and restart
  the server.  Note that this will destroy all your durable exchanges and
  queues, and all your persisted messages!

20080816:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/assp
  AUTHOR: J.R. Oldroyd <fbsd@opal.com>

  The periodic(8) script no longer outputs to files in the assp directory.
  You should remove /var/db/assp/nightly.log and nightly.log.old by hand
  once you are done with them.  The information that was stored there will
  now come in your nightly system email.

20080815:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/rdiff-backup
  AUTHOR: vd@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/rdiff-backup has been upgraded from 1.0.5 to 1.2.0.  This is
  an incompatible upgrade.  If you need the "old" 1.0.5, you can find it
  in sysutils/rdiff-backup10.

20080813:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  The layout of the ikiwiki.setup file has changed in a significant
  way in this release.  Old setup files will continue to work, but new
  features, like the new websetup interface, require a new format
  setup file.  You can convert old setup files into the new format by
  running the following command for all your ikiwiki.setup files:

	ikiwiki-transition setupformat ikiwiki.setup

20080812:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamdyke
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The spamdyke port has been updated to 4.0.2.  The new version is not
  backwards compatible with previous versions.  Please examine the new

  AFFECTS: users of databases/pgbouncer
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with port version 1.2.3, pgbouncer does not run as root anymore.
  If you are upgrading from earlier versions, please update your configuration
  in ${PREFIX}/etc/pgbouncer.ini to use log and pid file paths owned by the
  newly created pgbouncer user (or customize for a different user yourself).

  Default logfile: /var/log/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.log
  Default pidfile: /var/run/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.pid

  Then update as usual.

20080806:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Update to 1.3x, the net-p2p/transmission now is a meta-port. It depends on
  cli, daemon, and gtk2. If you don't want that, uninstall transmission and
  install net-p2p/transmission-cli by doing:

	portmaster -o net-p2p/transmission-cli net-p2p/transmission

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-p2p/transmission-cli net-p2p/transmission

20080805:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/qt4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The qt4 ports has been updated to 4.4.1.  With this update several ports
  specific problems have been fixed.  Qt4 headers and libraries have been
  moved to include/qt4 and lib/qt4.  bsd.qt.mk defines QT_INCDIR and
  QT_LIBDIR now, which could be used in qt4-dependent ports if required.
  Before you start to update your ports, please force update of qmake4 and
  qt4-corelib ports.  Portmaster users can do:

	portmaster devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

20080804:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  Git's cvsps dependency has been switched from cvsps-devel to cvsps.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following before
  upgrading git:

	portmaster -o devel/cvsps devel/cvsps-devel

20080728:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius2
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  Upgrading the FreeRADIUS port used to replace all unmodified files
  in your configuration with the latest version from the sample
  configuration. This strategy has two disadvantages; over time your
  configuration became based on different versions of the sample
  configuration, also major changes to the sample configuration could
  leave your configuration in a confusing state.

  From version 2.0.5, your configuration is not touched if any
  configuration files have been modified.

  You are recommended to track changes in the sample configuration and
  keep your configuration in a version control system. I use Subversion
  (see the devel/subversion port) to track my changes. Keeping the sample
  configuration in a 'vendor branch' (see the Subversion book for more
  details) allows easy merging of changes from the sample configuration.

  *** IMPORTANT ***

  You are urged to move your configuration out of the default location
  (/usr/local/etc/raddb) before upgrading from 2.0.4 (or earlier)
  to 2.0.5 (or later). Once this upgrade is complete, remove the sample
  configuration that has been installed in the default location and
  move your configuration back to the default location.

  This is a one time procedure that will prevent unmodified files in
  your configuration from being deleted from your configuration and not
  restored during the upgrade. No customised files will be lost in any
  circumstances.

  The sample configuration in 2.0.5 has been reorganised: the
  configuration of most modules is now in the modules directory rather
  than in radiusd.conf. You are urged to rearrange your configuration
  to match this layout.

  There are several improvements in this version of the port, including
  a new pkg-message that will help new FreeRADIUS users to get started
  with the port, also new 'reload' and 'debug' commands for the rc.d
  script. Enjoy!

20080725:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fm/nautilus and misc/shared-mime-info
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  In order to properly update x11-fm/nautilus and misc/shared-mime-info, do
  the following using portupgrade:

	# pkg_deinstall -fO nautilus
	# portupgrade shared-mime-info
	# portinstall -O nautilus

  Once misc/shared-mime-info has been updated, each user will need to run
  the following command:

20080725:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ojs2
  AUTHOR: Greg Larkin <glarkin@FreeBSD.org>

  If you are upgrading from a prior version of ojs2, please backup your
  database, uploaded files directory, and your config.inc.php before the
  upgrade.  Read /usr/local/share/docs/ojs2/UPGRADE or visit
  http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/UPGRADE for additional upgrade information.

20080721:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freenet6
  AUTHOR: Edwin Groothuis <edwin@mavetju.org>

  Please note that there has been a major update of this port (from
  version 2.x to 5.x) and that the name of the binaries and configuration
  files has changed from "tpsc" to "gw6c". The configuration files
  have to be copied from ${PREFIX}/share/examples/freenet6 to
  ${PREFIX}/etc again.

20080719:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fm/gprename
  AUTHOR: Martin Tournoij <carpetsmoker@rwxrwxrwx.net>

  GPRename configuration files now live ~/.config/gprename instead of ~/, to
  upgrade use the following commands:

	% mkdir -p ~/.config/gprename
	% mv ~/.gprename ~/.config/gprename/gprename
	% mv ~/.gprename_log ~/.config/gprename/gprename_log

20080717:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/anjuta
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Anjuta's neon dependency has been switched from neon26 to neon28.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following to upgrade:

	portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26
	portupgrade anjuta

20080714:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: Thomas-Martin Seck <tmseck@web.de>

  www/squid has been updated to Squid 2.7.STABLE3.

  The update should be rather straightforward.

  The only noticeable change in the port is that the ICAP patch is no
  longer included; this is because this patch was unmaintained for a long
  time and its use was not really recommended.  Please consider moving to
  Squid-3 (currently available as www/squid30) if you need ICAP support.

  Squid 2.6 is still available as www/squid26 and will probably be removed
  from the Ports Tree by the end of 2008.

20080712:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/rrdtool
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  If you use language bindings, like the Perl's RRDs, please upgrade

20080711:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  The port has been deprecated and gtkdatabox has been updated. This was
  done so the port tracks vendor name. Please update by doing:

	portupgrade -o x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2

20080709:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki editpage form now uses the raw page name, not the page title,
  in its `page' CGI parameter.  You will need to rebuild any existing
  IkiWiki installations in order to update their `edit' links to the new
  format.

20080708:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-devel
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to a 20080620 SVN snapshot, which uses the
  new (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade qemu-devel with the
  KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20080705:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki search plug-in now uses www/xapian-omega as backend instead
  of textproc/hyperestraier.  You will need to update the configuration of
  any search enabled IkiWiki installations and rebuild them since the
  search form has changed.

20080704:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/shared-mime-info
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The misc/shared-mime-info has been updated to 0.40. The Mime Types caches
  have been changed a bit. If you have created any custom MIME types, you
  will need to run update-mime-database to update your local Mime Types
  caches:

	$ update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ratbox-services
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Configuration file and database changes have been made between the
  1.1.x series and the current release version of ratbox-services.

  It is highly recommended that services are stopped, and the proper
  upgrade procedure is followed as described in port's documentation,
  before restarting newly updated ratbox-services again.

  Please remember to backup the database before attempting an
  upgrade, as incorrectly upgraded database may be rendered unusable.

  The ratbox-services-1.2.x branch implements multi-language support.
  However, an inconsistency in the language indexing may result in
  errors. It is therefore recommended that the English default to be
  used until the next version release.

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/nocc
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  The Nocc configuration file has been moved into 'config' subdir.
  When updating, remove the old conf.php file and reconfigure Nocc.

20080701:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion*
  AUTHOR: Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>

  subversion now uses neon-0.28.x (www/neon28) port, and automatic
  portupgrade will fail because www/neon28 will conflict with installed
  www/neon26 port.

  You should upgrade neon library before subversion with the command:

	# portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26

  Also, if you use any special subversion ports with bindings, you
  should upgrade these ports to clean subversion port with

	# portupgrade -o devel/subversion subversion-\*

  and install needed bindings (p5-subversion, py-subversion and/or
  ruby-subversion) after that.

  If you use subversion with bindings installed from devel/subversion
  with custom options, don't forget to install separate bindings ports
  after subversion upgrade.

20080630:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/cairo, graphics/poppler*, and future users of www/firefox3
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The poppler* ports have been updated to 0.8.3 and the shared libraries
  have changed.  Firefox 3.0 has been added to the tree as www/firefox3.
  These changes require that all dependent ports be updated.  You can do
  this in one of two ways:

	# portmaster pixman
	# portmaster \*cairo\*
	# portmaster -r poppler-0

  or:

	# pkgdb -Ff
	# portupgrade pixman\* \*cairo\*

  mach64 and r128 drivers are now separated out from the ati driver.
  These video cards are supported by x11-drivers/xf86-video-mach64
  and x11-drivers/xf86-video-r128 respectively. If you have one of
  the affected video cards and xorg.conf contains the following line:

	Driver	"ati"

  you must specify "mach64" or "r128". Alternatively, you may install
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati to get a wrapper driver.

  AFFECTS: users of science/gramps
  AUTHOR: Anders Troback <freebsd@troback.com>

  Before you upgrade from 2.x to 3.x you need to export your existing

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ircd-ratbox-devel
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Upgrading between different beta releases can cause problems when
  changes to the ban database schema have occurred.  The 'bantool'
  utility now comes with a -u switch that will check and update the
  ban database as necessary.

  Issuing 'bantool -u' is required when upgrading between beta releases
  and must not be done while the ircd is running.

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security
  AUTHOR: Marcelo Araujo <araujo@FreeBSD.org>

  The mod_security port has been updated from 1.9.4 to 2.5.5. Branch 1.9.x

20080617:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/nvi-devel
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  editors/nvi-devel has been changed to install nvi, nex, and nview as

  you use this port.

20080616:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dkim-milter
  AUTHOR: Hirohisa Yamaguchi <umq@ueo.co.jp>

  Most of the command line options can now be set in configure files.
  So the default values (such as milterdkim_socket) are changed to blank.
  Upgrading users should check the values both in rc.conf and
  dkim-filter.conf.

20080612:
  AFFECTS: users of www/linux-opera
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Opera port has been updated from 9.2x to 9.5x.  A lot of things have
  been changed such as keyboard shortcuts[1]; new storage and indexing
  formats for mail and feeds; new search.ini; probably more that I have
  missed.  I do not know if the keyboard shortcuts and search.ini will be
  overwritten.  You will be asked whether you want mail and feeds to be
  converted to new format during start up.  Warning: there is no way to
  downgrade back to the old format.  Be sure to see the Changelog[2].

  [1] http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/884/
  [2] http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/950/

  It is probably best for you to back up your linux-opera directory in
  case until you have no problem with new Opera for a while.  Also, you
  might have to re-configure search and keyboard shortcuts if these were
  overwritten:

	# cp -Rp ~/.linux-opera ~/.linux-opera-bak

  If you are seeing an error of undefined symbols related to GTK+, it is
  because it needs newer linux-gtk2 that ports doesn't have. You can enter
  'opera:config#FileSelector|DialogToolkit' in the address bar and change
  from 0 to 1 in 'Dialog Toolkit' if it annoys you.  0 = auto detection,
  1 = QT, and 2 = GTK+.

20080610:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/svnmailer
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Some of the config directives and sections allowed have changed.  You will

20080605:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of the upgrade to gettext-0.17, the shared library version
  of libintl has changed, so you will need to rebuild all ports that
  depend on gettext:

	# portupgrade -rf gettext
	# portmaster -r gettext

  Given the scope and sheer number of dependent ports, it may be more
  advisable to simply blow away all existing install ports (after
  keeping any local configuration changes), and rebuilding from scratch.

20080603:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs
  AUTHOR: Yasuhiro KIMURA <yasu@utahime.org>

  The port (editors/emacs) is updated to 22.2 and some of Emacs Lisp

  will need to update those also.

  COMPATIBILITY WITH 2.5.4:

  - when using SQL for logging (e.g. for a pen pals feature) or for
    quarantining, SQL tables maddr, msgs, msgrcpt and quarantine need
    to be extended by a new field 'partition_tag';  see below for details;

  - when SQL logging (pen pals) or SQL lookups are used, one can choose a
    binary or a character data type for fields users.email, mailaddr.email,
    and maddr.email; now may be a good opportunity to change a data type
    to binary (string of bytes);  see below for details;

  - when using SQL for logging, a default for $sql_clause{'upd_msg'}
    has changed, so if a configuration file replaces this SQL clause
    by a non-default setting, it needs to be updated;

  AFFECTS: users of audio/ampache
  AUTHOR: jadawin@FreeBSD.org

  Ampache 3.4 uses a different config parser.  Unfortunately the new parser
  is unable to read old config files.  In order to migrate your current
  configuration, you should run `php ${WWWDIR}/bin/migrate_config.inc' from
  the command line.

20080508:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/ptop
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The authors have changed the name of this utility to `pg_top'.  To avoid
  conflict with another port in the Tree with the same name we have retained
  `ptop' as the portname.  Note that binary has also changed to `pg_top'.
  Please start the utility with that name after updating.

20080507:
  AFFECTS: Perl interface users of audio/gramofile
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  Perl support is removed due to devel/swig11 removal in ports.  If you use
  the Perl interface, you are encouraged to use the new Audio::Gramofile
  found on CPAN (contact me for the ports).

20080506:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/collectd
  AUTHOR: daniel@roe.ch

  Previously, net-mgmt/collectd used to remove the config file even if it
  was changed by the user. This has now been fixed.

  To upgrade without losing your configuration, copy
  ${PREFIX}/etc/collectd.conf away to a safe place before upgrading
  net-mgmt/collectd.

  In addition, the default location of the data files changed from
  ${PREFIX}/var/lib/collectd to /var/db/collectd; you may want to move your
  data files and edit your configuration accordingly.

20080503:
  AFFECTS: users of net/skype-devel
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  Skype-devel port has been removed in favor and by upading of net/skype.

	portupgrade -o net/skype net/skype-devel

20080426:
  AFFECTS: users of www/phpgedview
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The install location of phpgedview has changed from www/data/phpGedView to
  www/phpgedview.  If you are updating from a previous version please do
  the following:

	mv /usr/local/www/data/phpGedView /usr/local/www

  You will also need to adjust the paths in your web server to reflect the
  new location.

20080416:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  Clamav 0.93 does not support the daily.inc and main.inc directories format
  for virus databases.  You need to remove these directories manually and
  force freshclam to get new cvd format files before starting clamd:

	portupgrade clamav
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/clamav-clamd stop
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/clamav-freshclam stop
	rm -rf /var/db/clamav/main.inc /var/db/clamav/daily.inc
	freshclam
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/clamav-freshclam start
	/usr/local/etc/rc.d/clamav-clamd start

20080408:
  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-Apache-Test
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/p5-Apache-Test doesn't actually need www/mod_perl{1,2}. If you would
  like to test a mod_perl, than please install www/mod_perl2 or www/mod_perl
  as well. The ports infrastructure doesn't support this (yet) but you can
  use it to test www/apache13, www/apache20, and/or www/apache22 without
  chaining www/p5-Apache-Test.

20080405:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/tracker
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org

  The sysutils/tracker port is now a meta port and tracker is now split into
  separate ports to allow non-GNOME users to install tracker without pulling
  in GNOME components. To upgrade please use the directions below.

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o sysutils/tracker-client tracker
	portmaster sysutils/tracker

  Portupgrade users:

  AFFECTS: users and maintainers of ports that depend on databases/sqlite3
  AUTHOR: mnag@FreeBSD.org

  Port databases/sqlite3 was updated to 3.5.6 and now has threads enabled
  by default.  If you encounter any problem with it, you can rebuild SQLite3
  without threads and test or change Makefile of affected port with this:

	sed -i.bak -E -e "s|USE_SQLITE=.*|USE_SQLITE=34|g" \
	    -e "s|databases/sqlite3|databases/sqlite34|g" Makefile

  Please report success or failure to port maintainer and to me.

  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  The new port is used just like emulators/linux_base-fc6.  Please, read
  carefully entry 20070327 about emulators/linux_base-fc6.

20080323:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/gstreamer
  AUTHOR: multimedia@FreeBSD.org

  Gstreamer port was updated.  Due to the move of some plugins between
  ports, you will have to rebuild the gstreamer-plugins-good port after
  upgrading.

  Portupgrade users:
    # portupgrade -a
    # portupgrade -f gstreamer-plugins-good

  Portmaster users:
    # portmaster -a

  AFFECTS: all GNOME users and ports depend on misc/gnomehier
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.22.0.  You have to deinstall a few ports first
  before using portupgrade or portmaster in order to successfully upgrade
  your GNOME installation.

  Portupgrade users:
    # pkgdb -Ff
    # pkg_deinstall -fO gnome-applets\* totem\* gnome-control-center\*

20080323:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/glib20 and future users of devel/gio-fam-backend
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  In order to update to glib 2.16 or higher, you must first update the
  glib20 port on its own or you will get a failure trying to install
  devel/gio-fam-backend saying it cannot find -lgio-2.0.  Portmaster users
  can do:

	portmaster glib-2

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade glib-2\*

  The layout of gnump3d 3.0 is changed, please read documentation and the
  manual pages of gnump3d.

20080318:
  AFFECTS: users of net/skype net/skype-devel
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  For FreeBSD versions 7.0 and above:

  It is required with both skype and skype-devel to update to linux_base-fc6.
  Please do the following:

  1. Make sure there are no running Linux applications.
  2. Unmount linprocfs (umount /compat/linux/proc)
  3. Uninstall your current linux_base port
  4. Set appropriate sysctl (sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16)
  5. Install emulators/linux_base-fc6
  6  Remount linprocfs (mount /compat/linux/proc)
  7. Add compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 to etc/sysctl.conf
  8. Add OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=fc6 to /etc/make.conf

  Note: These instructions also apply to linux_base-f8, please use the same
  osrelease.

  For FreeBSD versions 5.X and 6.X:

  Please use the legacy version net/skype12:

	portupgrade -o net/skype12 net/skype

20080316:
  AFFECTS: users of net/iscsi-target

  AFFECTS: users of mail/ezmlm-web
  AUTHOR: hans@nordhaug.priv.no

  The layout of ezmlm-web 3.2 is changed, please read documentation and
  the manual page of ezmlm-web.cgi.

20080312:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/enlightenment-devel, x11/ecore and grephics/evas
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  Evas and ecore ports have been split to separate modules to simplify
  dependency tracking. Thus, portupgrade in many cases won't be able to
  correctly update these ports.

  The easiest upgrade path would be to remove all EFL ports and install
  them from scratch. At least, you should reinstall ecore and evas.

  Please note that your old $HOME/.e is no longer compatible with new
  snapshot version. You will need to remove this directory and let e17
  create it automatically on the next startup.

20080306:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The update to version 1.0.12 will require manual change to the active
  configuration file.

  mail_extra_groups setting was commonly used insecurely. This setting is now
  deprecated. Most users should switch to using mail_privileged_group setting,
  but if you really need the old functionality use mail_access_groups instead.

20080303:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  gnutls has been updated to 2.2.2 and all shared libraries' versions have
  been bumped.  So you need to rebuild all applications that depend on
  gnutls. Do something like:

	portupgrade -rf gnutls

20080223:
  AFFECTS: users of www/instiki
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The default installation directory for instiki has changed from
  /usr/local/instiki to /usr/local/share/instiki.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your
  settings and data, please do the following:

	mv /usr/local/instiki /usr/local/share

  Then update as usual.

20080219:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xmonad
  AUTHOR: jacula@gmail.com

  From now XMonad uses a new configuration file system, so you don't have
  to edit Config.hs anymore.  Instead, create a custom configuration file
  ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs.  You can take a look at some samples on Xmonad's
  website.  Note that you can be interested in x11-wm/xmonad-contrib.

20080218:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/poco and devel/poco-ssl
  AUTHOR: lippemail@gmail.com

  The HashFunction class template has been changed in an incompatible way.
  The member function formerly named hash() is now the function call
  operator.  If you have defined your own HashFunction classes, then you
  have to update your code.

20080216:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/symon
  AUTHOR: uspoerlein@gmail.com

  The symon port has been updated from 2.75 to 2.78. It changes the wire
  protocol again. You should update your symux(8) and symon(8) installations
  simultaneously, as:

    - new symon clients will make old symux servers exit, and
    - new symux servers don't understand the old symon client's if() and
      mem() probes.

20080208:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  As was claimed in the entry 20070301 below in this file, you should fill
  ALT_DEPENDS section of pkgtools.conf for portupgrade to work correctly
  with your alternative dependencies.  Now it is an obligatory requirement.

  It was done as a compromise between speed and complexity.

20080203:
  AFFECTS: users of www/xshttpd
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  www/xshttpd now uses ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/ as a root directory for its
  data files.  The xshttpd configuration files have been moved to
  ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/conf/.  Please move the appropriate local files
  manually if you are upgrading from 3.4 or older versions.

20080202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/punbb
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  Install paths have changed. Please do the following prior to upgrade:

	cd /usr/local/www
	mv punbb punbb.old
	cp -R punbb.old/upload punbb

  It is now safe to update as usual.

  Notes:

  * You will probably get uninstall errors regarding files not found. It's
    safe to ignore them
  * Your webserver path has changed from www/punbb/upload to www/punbb,
    please adjust your webserver configuration and restart it
  * When you are satisfied with everything working properly you may remove
    the punbb.old directory:
	rm -r /usr/local/www/punbb.old

20080201:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ziproxy

  /usr/local/etc/ziproxy.

20080126:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Deluge was updated to version 0.5.8.2.  If you are using blocklist plugin,
  you have to remove blocklist.conf first before you can run it, or it will
  crash upon start up.

	$ rm -f ~/.config/deluge/blocklist.conf

20080125:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security2
  AUTHOR: araujo@FreeBSD.org

  Update of mod_security2 is a dramatic change, because there is a need
  to completely rewrite their obsolete rules and migrate for capacity to
  use new syntax.

  You are advised to make a complete backup of your configuration files
  before you can perform an update.

20080120:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache20
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  BDB framework provided by bsd.database.mk is now used by www/apache20
  port. WITH_BERKELEYDB knob is deprecated in favor of WITH_BDB and
  WITH_BDB_VER/WITH_BDB_BASE, see documentation for more details ('make
  show-options').

20080120:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22
  AUTHOR: clement@FreeBSD.org

  BDB framework provided by bsd.database.mk is now used by www/apache22
  port. WITH_BERKELEYDB knob is deprecated in favor of WITH_BDB and
  WITH_BDB_VER/WITH_BDB_BASE, see documentation for more details.
  ('make show-options').

20080118:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  FreeRADIUS 2.0 is now available as the net/freeradius2 port. All FreeRADIUS
  users are advised to consider upgrading to 2.0. It is the FreeRADIUS team's
  intention to put the 1.x server into 'maintenance' mode with just critical
  bug fixes.[1] 2.0 has many improvements including numerous bug fixes that
  were too difficult for the 1.x server, as well as many new features.

  Before uninstalling 1.x, it is recommended that you backup your
  configuration, which is typically in /usr/local/etc/raddb, then move it
  out of the way. It is also worth backing up the default configuration,
  which is typically in /usr/local/share/examples/freeradius/raddb.

  1.x configurations should work with the 2.0 server [2]. However the port
  automatically upgrades any unedited files in the configuration when you
  install a new version of FreeRADIUS. Installing 2.0 with the residue of a
  1.x configuration in the default location will result in a mixed 1.x and
  2.0 configuration that may not work.

  The recommended approach is to diff your 1.x configuration against the
  default 1.x configuration, then make corresponding changes to a copy
  of the default 2.0 configuration. If you moved your 1.x configuration out
  of the way before upgrading, you will have a 2.0 configuration ready to
  edit in the default location. It is worth reading man 5 unlang for details
  of the new FreeRADIUS 'un-language' before starting.

  Alternatively, you can move your 1.x configuration to another location,
  such as /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1, then edit /etc/rc.conf to point the rc.d
  script to that location. For example:

	radiusd_flags="-d /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1"

  I cannot guarantee that all 1.x configurations will work with the 2.0
  server, and I only recommend using a 1.x configuration as an interim
  measure.

20080108:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/bitlbee
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  irc/bitlbee now stores saved user settings in /var/db/bitlbee/, not
  $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/.  You will have to manually move any existing user
  settings to the new location (or override the user settings directory
  using -d if you wish to keep the old behavior).  Other configuration
  files are still kept in $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/ by default.

  The default installation is now configured for running bitlbee as user
  'nobody' by default.  Make sure any existing configuration files are
  readable by that user.
