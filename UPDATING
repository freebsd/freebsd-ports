This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when upgrading
your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions, but sometimes
they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each time
you update your ports collection, before attempting any port upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of net/openistgt
  AUTHOR: jpaetzel@FreeBSD.org

  Between istgt supporting target reload, and iscsid using CTL there is no
  point to this port.  As such it has been deleted without warning, since
  the support for it is as best questionable.

  pkgng users:
  
  # pkg set -o net/openistgt:net/istgt

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o net/istgt net/openistgt
  # portmaster -r istgt

  portupgrade users:

  # portupgrade -o net/istgt -f net/openistgt
  # portupgrade -fr net/istgt

  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-setuptools dependent ports
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  devel/py-setuptools is being used for every python ports (if USE_PYDISTUTILS
  defined) since r336553. Due to PKGORIGIN limitation, we cannot build one
  python port with python27 and the other with python33 since they require
  different setuptools versions which have same PKGORIGIN. With the addition
  of py-setuptools{27,32,33}, we could now have py27-foo and py33-bar coexist
  in one system.

  Note that this is only a short-term solution. It does not help if you need
  coexistence of one port with different python versions, e.g. py27-foo and
  py33-foo.

  Please rebuild all ports that depend on devel/py-setuptools and use
  devel/py-setuptools{27,32,33} instead.
  
  XX represents python version (27, 32 or 33) in the following steps.

  pkgng users:

  # pkg set -o devel/py-setuptools:devel/py-setuptoolsXX

  portmaster users:

  # portmaster -o devel/py-setuptoolsXX devel/py-setuptools
  # portmaster -r py\*setuptools

  portupgrade users:

  # portupgrade -o devel/py-setuptoolsXX -f devel/py-setuptools
  # portupgrade -fr devel/py-setuptools

  AFFECTS: users of security/kwallet
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.12.3. kwallet package has been renamed
  to match upstream naming. pkgng users need to update package origin
  manually:

  # pkg set -o security/kwallet:security/kwalletmanager

20140302:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/ansible
  AUTHOR: rm@FreeBSD.org

  This is an major update and changes were introduced in ansible 1.5, that
  are not backward compatible. Please refer changelog there before update:
  https://raw.github.com/ansible/ansible/v1.5.0/CHANGELOG.md

20140223:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/mk-livestatus
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  livecheck was removed in 1.2.3.i5. It never was really stable, Nagios4
  has something similar built in. 
  Please remove the "livecheck=..." directive from etc/nagios/nagios.cfg.

20140222:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/courier-imap
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  When using SSL and updating from an older version, run mkdhparams(8) to
  create the new TLS_DHPARAMS file which is needed for Courier IMAP 4.15
  and up.

20140222:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/turpial
  AUTHOR: olivierd@FreeBSD.org

  Turpial has been updated to 3.0, due to changes in net-im/turpial port it
  will be necessary to remove it before updating.

20140220:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/vim
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  The editors/vim port has been reworked to simplify option handling. In UI
  option group, a new option (CONSOLE) was added for users who do not need
  GUI support. This option is off by default. You might encounter install
  or package failures with "old" option setting. Please run "make config" to
  modify your setting.

20140219:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/docbook*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The textproc/docbook-* ports have been consolidated into two ports
  textproc/docbook-sgml and textproc/docbook-xml.

  Before upgrading you should force the removal of the existing ports, they
  will conflict with the new ones.

  pkg users can run:

    pkg delete -f docbook-xml\* docbook-sk\* docbook\[2345\]\?\?-\* docbook-4\*

  the other users can run:

    pkg_delete -f docbook-xml\* docbook-sk\* docbook\[2345\]\?\?-\* docbook-4\*

20140218:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.12.2. kdeadmin, kdenetwork, kdesdk,
  and kdetoys ports have been split due to upstream changes.

  KDE Workspace port has been updated to 4.11.6. It requires modern
  Mesa libraries, provided by WITH_NEW_XORG knob. To update Xorg ports
  to newer version follow instructions at https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics

20140218:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/kdehier4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE4_PREFIX has been changed from /usr/local/kde4 to /usr/local.
  All ports that depends on kdehier4 must be reinstalled.
  PORTREVISION for affected ports has been increased, upgrading tools
  (portmaster, pkg) should handle this update without manual intervention.
  Please check /usr/local/kde4 for leftovers after upgrade. If you don't
  have locally modified files, e.g. under /usr/local/kde4/etc, you may
  safely remove /usr/local/kde4.

20140214:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  Perl 5.12 has been removed.  The default Perl is lang/perl5.16.

  pkg(8) users:
    1) Update the origin to point to 5.16:
       pkg set -o lang/perl5.12:lang/perl5.16

    2) Upgrade perl and all dependencies:
       pkg install -Rf lang/perl5.16

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
       pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
       portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f lang/perl5.12

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
       portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

    Conservative:
      portmaster p5-

    Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
      portmaster -r perl-

    Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port specify the name of
      the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.  Also, depending on when
      perl 5.12 was installed last, the prefix may be perl-, perl5- or
      perl5.12-.

20140211:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/php* database/postgresql* database/mysql* www/apache*
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default versions of lang/php*, databases/postgresql*,
  databases/mysql* and www/apache* have been changed to support the
  new DEFAULT_VERSIONS variable.

  DEFAULT_APACHE_VER, DEFAULT_MYSQL_VER, DEFAULT_PGSQL_VER,
  DEFAULT_FPC_VER and DEFAULT_PHP_VER are now deprecated.  You can use
  the new DEFAULT_VERSIONS variable like this:

  DEFAULT_VERSIONS=php=5.5 mysql=5.6 apache=2.4

20140208:
  AFFECTS: users of spamdyke
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Spamdyke has been updated to 5.0.0. The behavior has changed from

  http://www.spamdyke.org/documentation/UPGRADING_version_4_to_version_5.txt

20140208:
  AFFECTS: users of icu
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  icu has been updated to 52.1. Please rebuild all ports that depend on it
  if you have the glib20 port built with COLLATION_FIX option activated

  If you use portmaster:
        portmaster -w -r icu
  If you use portupgrade:
        portupgrade -fr devel/icu
  If you use pkgng with binary packages:
        pkg install -fR devel/icu

20140201:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/zabbix*
  AUTHOR: koobs@FreeBSD.org

  The login shell for the zabbix user in UIDs was changed from
  /usr/sbin/nologin to /bin/sh to fix the zabbix-agent UserParameter
  feature.

  To update the existing user on your system, run:

  # pw usermod zabbix -s /bin/sh

20140114:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_authnz_external
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  www/mod_authnz_external was moved to www/mod_authnz_external22
  Please do the following according to package manager used.

  # portmaster -o www/mod_authnz_external22 www/mod_authnz_external
    or
  # portupgrade -fo www/mod_authnz_external22 www/mod_authnz_external
    or
  # pkg set -o www/mod_authnz_external:www/mod_authnz_external22

20140113:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba41
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  With the introduction of Samba 4.1 corresponding port lost SWAT support
  and made WINBIND support mandatory. As samba4 introduced additional 'samba'
  daemon to the tripplet of nmbd/smbd/winbindd to avoid confusion startup
  script for samba41 was renamed to 'samba_server'. To start the whole band
  up it's enough to add to the rc.conf:

  samba_server_enable="YES"

  Startup script tries it's best to guess which out of samba/nmbd/smbd/winbindd
  daemons have to be started, but you can fine tune this by specifying them in
  rc.conf, just make sure that samba_server_enable is enabled(see entry for 20121022).

20140112:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libical
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The libical port was updated to 1.0.0. Due to the shared library bump
  and the removal of the .la file, all ports that use libical need to be
  rebuilt.

  # portmaster -r libical
   or
  # portupgrade -fr libical
   or
  # pkg install -fR libical

20140111:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/go
  AUTHOR: jlaffaye@FreeBSD.org

  Third party Go packages installed via the ports tree are no longer installed
  in GOROOT (PREFIX/go) but in a specific path: PREFIX/share/go

  Affected ports had their PORTREVISION bumped.
  To reinstall these packages via the ports tree, it is needed to deinstall
  them first (the build will fail if the `go` command detects that they
  already exists in GOROOT).

  If you are using these third party Go packages for local Go development,
  you have to add this new path to your GOPATH environment variable.

20140107:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 4 ports
  AUTHOR: makc@FreeBSD.org

  Qt 4 ports framework has been reworked, several ports have been renamed.
  To ease upgrading run the following set of commands:

  # pkg set -o devel/qt4-declarative:x11-toolkits/qt4-declarative
  # pkg set -o devel/qt4-qtestlib:devel/qt4-testlib
  # pkg set -o textproc/qt4-clucene:textproc/clucene-qt4
  # pkg set -o www/qt4-webkit:www/webkit-qt4
  # pkg set -o x11/qt4-opengl:graphics/qt4-opengl

20140102:
  AFFECTS: users of archivers/p7zip
  AUTHOR: rakuco@FreeBSD.org

  The MINIMAL and MODULES options have been removed from archivers/p7zip,
  which now unconditionally installs the 7z, 7za and 7zr, as if the MINIMAL
  option was previously unset.

  The RAR decompression codec, whose source code has a more restrictive
  license that forbids its use for creating RAR archives, has been moved to
  a separate port, archivers/p7zip-codec-rar.

20131230:
  AFFECTS: ports using Apache Software License 2.0
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The acronym for Apache Software License 2.0 was renamed to APACHE20

20131226:
  AFFECTS: users of security/cyrus-sasl2
  AUTHOR: ume@FreeBSD.org

  The SASL GSSAPI authentication plugin was removed from
  security/cyrus-sasl2 port and divided into new
  security/cyrus-sasl2-gssapi port.

  If you are using the SASL GSSAPI authentication, please install
  security/cyrus-sasl2-gssapi port, in addition to upgrading
  security/cyrus-sasl2 port.

20131218:
  AFFECTS: users of news/cnews
  AUTHOR: dinoex@FreeBSD.org

  The default path for overview files has changed.
  Rebuild your overview files after the update with:
  su - news /usr/local/libexec/cnews/nov/initov

20131217:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/ruby-bdb or ports-mgmt/portupgrade and databases/db5 or databases/db6
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  databases/db5 and databases/db6 have recently been updated to fix
  bugs. This changed their patchlevel version.

  However, ruby-bdb used to break during the db[56] upgrade due to a bug
  described in <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=184921>.

  THEREFORE, YOU MUST MANUALLY UPGRADE databases/ruby-bdb INDIVIDUALLY
  TO 0.6.6_2 OR NEWER WHEN USING portupgrade AGAINST databases/db[56]
  PORTS. To achieve that, type:

  # portupgrade databases/ruby-bdb
  or
  # portmaster -x 'db*' databases/ruby-bdb

  before proceeding with other upgrades.

  Should you have corrupted the portupgrade databases, or if ruby-bdb
  refuses to work with the upgraded db* port with errors such as "DB
  needs compatible versions of libdb & db.h", then rebuild the ruby-bdb
  port manually, and fix the portupgrade databases:

  # make -C /usr/ports/databases/ruby-bdb all deinstall install clean
  # pkgdb -fu
  # portupgrade -f db5 db6

  This should return portupgrade to normal operation.

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xorg, graphics/libGL, graphics/dri, all xorg ports
  AUTHOR: zeising@FreeBSD.org

  The default xorg version has been switched on FreeBSD CURRENT.

  To upgrade graphics/libGL, graphics/dri and related MESA ports, it is
  necessary to first remove the old versions of those ports.
  No special upgrade procedure is needed for xorg port but it is
  necessary to recompile all xorg drivers (xf86-*) and other ports that
  depend on the xserver version, including
  emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions.  Portrevisions have been bumped
  where needed, but users of drivers not in the ports tree will need to
  recompile those.

  If it is important to stay on the old versions, it is possible to
  specify WITHOUT_NEW_XORG= in /etc/make.conf to get the old xorg
  distribution.

  To update:

  # pkg_delete -f libGL-\* dri-\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f libGL dri
    followed by
  # portmaster graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    or
  # portupgrade graphics/dri graphics/libGL
    and then
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20131216:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db4*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  Berkeley DB versions before and excluding 4.8 have been marked deprecated.
  New port installations should be based on Berkeley DB 5 or 6.

  Note that Oracle Berkeley DB 6 is under the more restrictive Affero GPL v3
  license, be sure to review if using that fits your requirements.

  You can add WITH_BDB_VER=5 or WITH_BDB_VER=6 to /etc/make.conf to have all
  applications that get rebuilt use Oracle Berkeley DB 5 or 6, respectively.

  DO NOT FORCE DELETE older BerkeleyDB packages, that breaks the upgrade
  tools.  Instead, first rebuild the ports that depend on it, then
  remove the old Berkeley DB versions.

  Berkeley DB ports should be able to build/install with an older and a
  newer version version both installed if WITH_BDB_VER is set.  If a
  port then grabs the old Berkeley DB version, that is an issue with the
  port that requires Berkeley DB, and should be reported to the
  maintainer.

  If you are interested in upgrading now already, we have instructions
  at <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/BerkeleyDBCleanup>.

20131209:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/bind96, dns/bind98 and bind99 on FreeBSD 10.0
  AUTHOR: erwin@FreeBSD.org

  Bind versions before 9.6.3.2.ESV.R10_2, 9.8.6_2, and 9.9.4_2 on

  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/vte
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The gnome-pty-helper program has been split off from the vte package
  to allow both vte and vte3 to be installed at the same time. To update
  after this change please do the following:

  # pkg_delete -f vte\*
   or
  # pkg delete -fg vte\*
   followed by

20131203:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opencv, graphics/opencv-core
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  OpenCV has been updated to 2.4.7.  Due to movement of files between the
  opencv port and the opencv-core port, it will be necessary to remove
  both packages before updating.

  # pkg_delete -f opencv\*
    or
  # pkg delete -fg opencv\*
    followed by
  # portmaster -a
    or
  # portupgrade -a

20131127:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/py-distribute (i.e you)
  AUTHOR: wg@FreeBSD.org

  devel/py-distribute was replaced with devel/py-setuptools. Please do
  the following according to package manager used. py-distribute port
  will be removed shortly.

  # portmaster -o devel/py-setuptools devel/py-distribute
    or
  # portupgrade -fo devel/py-setuptools devel/py-distribute
    or

20131125:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_wsgi
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/mod_wsgi moved to www/mod_wsgi2 to reflect the port version.

  # portmaster -o www/mod_wsgi2 www/mod_wsgi
    or
  # portupgrade -fo www/mod_wsgi2 www/mod_wsgi
    or

20131120:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12 lang/perl5.14 lang/perl5.16 and lang/perl5.18
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The THREADS option has been enabled by default in all Perl. If you're using
  binary packages you need to do :

    # pkg install -Rf perl5

  If you're not using binary packages, and want to switch from non threaded
  Perl to threaded Perl, you need to recompile and reinstall most ports
  depending on Perl. Supposing you have Perl 5.16, you would do:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
    1) Change the option in lang/perl5.16:
        make -C /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 config

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portmaster -r perl5-

  Note: The installed Perl package was named perl and is now named perl5, if
	you have not updated your installation in a long time, you may need to
	use "perl-" here.

20131112:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/nsd
  AUTHOR: erwin@FreeBSD.org

  dns/nsd was updated to the new 4.0.0 major release.

  This version replaces the nsdc control program with nsd-control.
  This requires some manual setup with nsd-control-setup and editing
  of the config files. nsd-control is incompatible with nsdc so when
  that is used in scripts, these should be adapted.  More information:
  http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/svn/nsd/tags/NSD_4_0_0_REL/doc/NSD-4-features

  NSD version 3 is still supported in dns/nsd3.  To keep the old
  version:
  # portmaster -o dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # portupgrade -fo dns/nsd3 dns/nsd
    or
  # pkg set -o dns/nsd:dns/nsd3

20131112:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/bind9*
  AUTHOR: erwin@FreeBSD.org

  All bind9 ports have been updated to support FreeBSD 10.x after
  BIND was removed from the base system.  It is now self-contained
  in ${PREFIX}/etc/namedb, and chroot and symlinking options are
  no longer supported out of the box.

  For users of FreeBSD 9.x and earlier, the LINKS option is no longer
  enabled by default, but still supported.  No other changes should
  affect those users, and updating without changing already set options
  will keep the system in the same state.

20131103:
  AFFECTS: users of security/libtasn1 and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  libtasn1 has been updated to 3.3 and all shared libraries versions have
  been bumped. So you need to rebuild all applications that depend on
  libtasn1.

  # portmaster -r libtasn1
    or
  # portupgrade -fr security/libtasn1
    or
  # pkg install -fR security/libtasn1

20131031:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/rtmpdump
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The library part of multimedia/rtmpdump is split into multimedia/librtmp.
  multimedia/rtmpdump now depends on the library port.

  A build error can occur if you built and installed old rtmpdump by
  using stock OpenSSL, and then install security/openssl and try to build
  multimedia/rtmpdump without deinstalling the installed one.  Please
  make sure if the old rtmpdump is removed before building the new version.

20131028:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/dcf77pi
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  As of version 1.0.5 the configuration file was renamed from
  hardware.txt to config.txt and the format has been made more flexible.

  If you have customized any parameters, be sure to copy them to
  config.txt after which hardware.txt can be removed.

20131028:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/ffmpeg1 and multimedia/ffmpeg-devel
  AUTHOR: wg@FreeBSD.org

  The port ffmpeg was updated, ffmpeg1 and ffmpeg-devel were removed in
  favor of ffmpeg.

  # portmaster -o multimedia/ffmpeg multimedia/ffmpeg1
    or
  # portupgrade -fo multimedia/ffmpeg multimedia/ffmpeg1
    or
  # pkg set -o multimedia/ffmpeg1:multimedia/ffmpeg

  and

  # portmaster -o multimedia/ffmpeg multimedia/ffmpeg-devel

20131023:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12 lang/perl5.14
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The default Perl has been switched to lang/perl5.16.  These examples
  are for switching from lang/perl5.14, if you are running another
  version, replace lang/perl5.14 with the origin of the Perl you have
  installed.

  Pkgng users:

    # pkg set -o lang/perl5.14:lang/perl5.16
    # pkg install -Rf lang/perl5.16

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
	portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f lang/perl5.14

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr lang/perl5.16

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.14

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port you will need to specify
        the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20131020:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/squirrelmail
  AUTHOR: adamw@adamw.org

  The default location for user data files and attachments has changed.
  This will only affect new installations, and upgrading SquirrelMail
  WILL NOT break your current installation.

  To make use of the new locations, do the following:

  # cp -rp /var/spool/squirrelmail/pref/* /usr/local/www/squirrelmail/data
  # cp -rp /var/spool/squirrelmail/attach/* /usr/local/www/squirrelmail/attach

  and then run /usr/local/www/squirrelmail/configure and tell SM about
  it ("Data Directory" and "Attachment Directory" under "General Options").

  This version of SquirrelMail is a SNAPSHOT that brings in PHP 5.4 and 5.5
  compatibility.

20131020:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gpgme
  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  The library version of security/gpgme has changed, and PORTREVISION has
  been bumped in all dependent ports.  If you have external software that
  depends on gpgme, this software needs to be recompiled.
  To recompile all software dependent on gpgme, run:

  # portmaster -r gpgme

  A new USES has been added: compiler.mk, this uses allows porters to
  select a compiler for a given port based on the features the port needs
  By default this will always try to find Clang > 3.3.
  If the user prefers using GCC then the following macro should be added
  to user's make.conf: FAVORITE_COMPILER=gcc

  The default versions of lang/python* have been changed to support the
  new DEFAULT_VERSIONS variable.

  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION, PYTHON2_DEFAULT_VERSION and
  PYTHON3_DEFAULT_VERSION are deprecated. If you have set them in your

  The library version of x11/pixman has changed, and PORTREVISION has
  been bumped in all dependent ports.  If you have external software that
  depends on pixman, this software needs to be recompiled.
  To recompile all software dependent on pixman, run:

  # portmaster -r pixman

  AFFECTS: Users of ports
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  New way to override the default version of a language in the ports
  tree.

  The make variable, DEFAULT_VERSIONS, allows users to override the
  default version defined by the ports tree.

  For example, to declare specific versions for Perl, Ruby and Tcl/Tk,
  it would be defined as:

	DEFAULT_VERSIONS=	perl5=5.18 ruby=2.0 tcltk=8.6

  Today, this only is supported by Perl, Ruby, and Tcl/Tk.

  AFFECTS: Users of ports
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Optional Stack Protector [1] support has been added with the WITH_SSP_PORTS
  knob.

  WITH_SSP_PORTS=	yes

  This currently is only supported on FreeBSD 10 amd64/i386 and earlier
  releases on amd64.

  The default SSP_CLFAGS is -fstack-protector, but -fstack-protector-all
  may optionally be set instead.

  To enable support, add WITH_SSP_PORTS=yes to your make.conf and rebuild all
  ports.

  # portmaster -af
    or
  # portupgrade -af

  AFFECTS: 10-CURRENT users with any port depending on converters/libiconv
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  10-CURRENT after r254273 (committed on August 13, 2013) has an
  implementation of iconv enabled by default in libc.

  NOTE: after r341775 (committed on January 29, 2014) and other
  following commits, a few ports, including devel/glib20, depend
  on the devel/libiconv again due to missing functionality in the
  base iconv implementation.

  Due to this change some major overhauling of the ports tree has
  been necessary to move the ports to using that implementation.

  People using pkgng binary packages should have little problems,
  "pkg upgrade" will update all software to not depend on libiconv
  anymore, once updated packages are available. Please make sure to
  perform a "pkg autoremove" after that and check that libiconv is
  correctly removed by it.

  If you are using ports the update requires some manual intervention.
  The following procedure should be followed:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update
  # pkg delete -f libiconv
  # cat ports_to_update | xargs portmaster

  or:

  # pkg query %ro libiconv >ports_to_update
  # pkg delete -f libiconv
  # cat ports_to_update | xargs portupgrade -f

  AFFECTS: users of lang/python*
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/python* ports do not install links to 2to3, idle, pydoc, python
  and other binaries anymore. Those were moved into the lang/python2 and
  lang/python3 ports respectively. This change brings us closer to the goal
  of making Python ports usable with different Python versions at the same
  time.

  If you have lang/python2* or lang/python3* installed, please also install
  the associated lang/python2 or lang/python3 port.

  1. update lang/python2* and/or lang/python3*
  2. install lang/python2 and/or lang/python3
  3. install/update lang/python

20130816:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/opendx and math/octave-forge-octcdf
  AUTHOR: stephen@FreeBSD.org

  These two ports have changed the science/netcdf dependency to
  science/netcdf4.  It is recommended that the science/netcdf package
  be deinstalled before rebuilding these ports, otherwise you are likely
  to face port conflicts when building future ports.

20130731:
  AFFECTS: users of glib20
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/gio-fam-backend port was removed in the glib 2.36 update.
  Since the gio-fam-backend port was used in USE_GNOME=glib20, all
  dependencies need to be rebuilt. The removal of gio-fam-backend isn't
  critical, glib20 using programs should work just fine if the port is still
  installed. It is not clear however, if glib20 will use the new kqueue
  backend or the old fam backend.

  Note that users of pkg packages can just run the pkg delete command after
  their next update.

  # portmaster -r gio-fam-backend
  # pkg_delete gio-fam-backend-\* (for pkgng: pkg delete gio-fam-backend)
  # portmaster -a

    or

  # portupgrade -rf gio-fam-backend

  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  All ports based on Qt 3 (including KDE 3 but also ports which used Qt 3
  as a graphical toolkit) expired on 20130701 because Qt 3 and KDE 3 were
  no longer maintained upstream.  These ports have been removed today.

  Users of KDE 3 are advised to switch to another desktop environment
  provided in the Ports Collection, e.g. KDE 4 or Xfce.

  Users of Qt 3 are advised to upgrade to the Qt 4 counterpart(s).

  AFFECTS: users of japanese/mozc-server and japanese/mozc-el
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The bin/mozc_emacs_helper program is now built and installed by
  japanese/mozc-server because the build processes are heavily
  overlapped with each other and the helper program does not depend on
  most of what mozc-server does actually.  To upgrade them, please remove
  mozc-el first to prevent a conflict with the installed bin/mozc_emacs_helper.

  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The logcheck port now provides a configuration option controlling
  installation of the crontab file. When installing the port interactively,
  the port option is enabled by default to mimic previous behavior.

  When the port is installed non-interactively (BATCH=yes) the crontab
  file *will not* be installed automatically. If the EXAMPLES port option
  is enabled, the crontab file can be installed manually at a later time
  from EXAMPLESDIR/crontab.in.

  AFFECTS: users of net/avahi-gtk
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  Avahi was updated to 0.6.31, due to changes in the avahi-gtk port it will
  be necessary to remove the avahi-gtk port before updating.
  Users of pkg packages can skip this step.

  # pkg_delete -f avahi-gtk\*
    or
  # pkg delete -f avahi-gtk

20130711:
  AFFECTS: users of dns/py-ldns
  AUTHOR: mat@FreeBSD.org

  The dns/py-ldns port now only installs the Python bits, and depends on
  dns/ldns.  Because of that, you cannot just do a regular upgrade, it
  would install dns/ldns overwriting existing files and removing them when
  removing the old version of dns/py-ldns.

  # pkg_delete -f py-ldns-\*
  # cd /usr/ports/dns/py-ldns && make clean && make install clean
    or
  # pkg delete -fg py-ldns-\*
  # pkg install -f dns/py-ldns

  AFFECTS: users of www/ajaxplorer
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Ajaxplorer was updated to 5.0.1. This is a major update and some
  manual intervention may be needed.

  Before upgrading you should preserve the following files in WWWDIR
  (defaults to PREFIX/www/ajaxplorer) if you have customized them:

  conf/bootstrap_conf.php
  conf/bootstrap_context.php
  conf/bootstrap_plugins.php
  conf/bootstrap_repositories.php

  and put them back after the upgrade.

  If you are using a database backend you will need to manually
  update your database table using the sql script the port will
  install at WWWDIR/conf/conf/4.2.3-5.0.0-db-upgrade.sql

  Don't forget to check the documentation about upgrading from

  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The KDE Software Compilation 4.10.4 was committed a few days ago, and
  version 4.10.5 was committed today.

  They include better support for using clang as the compiler, but that
  requires recompiling all KDE ports which depend on x11/kdelibs4. Most
  ports which fall into this category are already part of the KDE Software
  Compilation and have been updated to version 4.10.5, but those released
  separately need to be rebuilt manually.

  If you are building your KDE ports with clang, doing the following is
  recommended:

  # portmaster -r kdelibs-4\*
    or
  # portupgrade -fr x11/kdelibs4
    or
  # pkg install -fR x11/kdelibs4

  Alternatively, to avoid rebuilding the ports which are part of the 4.10.5
  update:

  # portmaster -x \*-4.10.5\* -r kdelibs-4\*
    or
  # portupgrade -x \*-4.10.5\* -fr x11/kdelibs4

20130627:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Since June 22nd, portmaster no longer relies on 'WITH_PKGNG' to be defined,
  or ports to be checked out to enable pkgng support.

  It now considers whether or not pkg is installed and registered with itself.

  I.e., if this returns data, pkgng is considered in use:

    # pkg info pkg

  It's possible that you may have tested pkgng in the past, ran pkg2ng, and
  never fully committed to it by setting WITH_PKGNG. If this is the case,
  uninstall pkg with pkg_info/pkg_delete and also remove the stale database,
  rm /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite.

  This could manifest itself as portmaster -L showing the wrong versions, or
  portmaster no longer detecting installed packages correctly.

  Note that PORTS still require WITH_PKGNG=yes in make.conf if you are not
  running CURRENT.

20130627:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba36
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Samba has updated format of it's printing tdbs (ntprinting.tdb, ntforms.tdb,
  ntdrivers.tdb) to include character encoding. When updating from Samba 3.5
  or earlier to Samba 3.6 or 4.0 these tdbs need to be migrated to new registry
  based printing management. This implies also character conversion.

  You have to specify the correct code page for the conversion, see iconv -l.
  The mostly used one is Windows Latin1 which is CP1252.

  You can correctly view the tdb with:

  # net printing dump encoding=CP1252 /path/to/ntprinters.tdb

  or migrate it with e.g.:

  # net printing migrate encoding=CP1252 /path/to/ntprinters.tdb

  If you migrate printers it is suggest to do it in the following order:

  ntforms.tdb
  ntdrivers.tdb
  ntprinting.tdb

  Don't forget to rename, move or delete these files in /var/db/samba after
  the migration.

  net-im/mikutter003 has been removed from the ports tree because the
  Twitter API version 1.0 was deprecated on 2013-05-07 and mikutter003,
  which uses the API 1.0, won't work.
  Please consider using net-im/mikutter instead of this.

  AFFECTS: users of www/magento
  AUTHOR: melvyn@magemana.nl

  Magento has been updated to 1.7.0.2 on 2013-06-03. With it a stricter file
  system policy is enforced on the port. If you (or your customer) rely heavily
  on Magento Connect via the backend to install extensions, your quickfix is:

  # chown -R www: ${PREFIX}/www/magento
  # chmod -R u+w ${PREFIX}/www/magento

  The more conservative approach:
  # chown -R www: ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/code/{local,community} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/{design,locale} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/{downloader,skin}

  # chmod -R u+w ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/code/{local,community} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/app/{design,locale} \
    ${PREFIX}/www/magento/{downloader,skin}

  The conservative approach will alert you to extensions that try to write in
  Magento core, while allowing clean extensions to install properly (corner
  cases may exist).

20130619:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  devel/subversion has been upgraded from 1.7.10 to 1.8.0

  please check, that the SERF option is enabled, as NEON support
  is gone. Also, mod_dontdothat and svnauthz_validate are
  now enabled with one option TOOLS, among other new tools
  and SVNMUCC is enabled always.

  subversion-1.7.x is available as devel/subversion17

  To stay on subversion-1.7.x set in /etc/make.conf
  WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=17

20130614:
  AFFECTS: users who set port options in make.conf
  AUTHOR: tijl@FreeBSD.org

  Configuring options in make.conf using variables like OPTIONS_SET and
  OPTIONS_UNSET now also suppresses the option dialog for those options.
  This means that when building a port the option dialog will only appear if
  there are truly new options that have not been configured before using either
  the dialog or make.conf.  This allows you to set options like DOCS, NLS,
  X11, etc. once for all ports and not have option dialogs pop up if those are
  the only options.  For a list of variables you can set in make.conf to
  control options see Mk/bsd.options.mk.

  AUTHOR: swills@FreeBSD.org

  The default ruby version has been updated from 1.8 to 1.9. First, stop any

  on ruby:

  If you use portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/ruby19 lang/ruby18
  # portmaster -R -r ruby-1.9

  If you use portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby18
  # portupgrade -f lang/ruby19 # if you have it installed
  # portupgrade -f ports-mgmt/portupgrade
  # portupgrade -x ruby-1.8.\* -fr lang/ruby18

  After these steps are complete, you can pkg_delete ruby 1.8 if you
  no longer need it.

  If you use pkgng:
  # pkg set -o lang/ruby18:lang/ruby19
  # pkg install -fR lang/ruby19

  If you wish to keep the 1.8 version as default, add the following lines
  to your /etc/make.conf file:

  AUTHOR: tj@FreeBSD.org

  This is the first stable release based on Lucene 4. We recommend testing
  the upgrade before doing it in production.

  Upgrading from 0.20 requires a full cluster restart.

  In order to be able to downgrade, stop indexing new data, issue a flush
  request, do the upgrade and only enable indexing of new data once you
  are certain that you no longer need to downgrade.  Once new data has
  been indexed, downgrading is no longer possible. To be extra safe, back
  up your data before upgrading.

20130512:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/hs-git-annex
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  On FreeBSD, git-annex incorrectly calculated SHA256 hashes for files
  added to the annex repository due to the BSD-style output of
  /sbin/sha256.  The result of this is silent data corruption.

  This problem has been fixed, but every file stored in an annex
  repository will fail a `git-annex fsck` after the upgrade.  Thus,
  before updating, it is wise to issue the command below and restore the
  files.

  Corruptions can then be found by finding all files with the same hash.
  Note that only files that were mishashed to the same location are a
  problem.

  AFFECTS: users of TeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  One can now choose TeXLive or teTeX by using TEX_DEFAULT.
  Specifying TEX_DEFAULT=texlive, almost all of ports which use TeX
  will install and depend on TeXLive-based ones.  Note that the
  default value is still "tetex" and the two cannot coexist.  You need
  to remove all of the TeX-related packages based on teTeX to try
  TeXLive.

20130507:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/usbmuxd or comms/libimobiledevice
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  libusbmuxd and libimobiledevice versions have changed. Please, rebuild
  all the ports that depend on them:

  # portmaster -r usbmuxd

  # portupgrade -fr comms/usbmuxd
    or
  # pkg install -fR comms/usbmuxd

  AFFECTS: users of devel/libplist
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  libplist Python bindings were split from the main port. To get them you
  need to install devel/py-libplist.

20130506:
  AFFECTS: users of TeX
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  TeXLive ports have been imported.  Although most of ports still depend
  on teTeX at this moment, they will be converted to use TeXLive.

  The directory layout of them is as follows.  Please use print/texlive-full
  if you are not familiar with how each component works.  Finer-grained
  ports will be added (specifically, meta ports for smaller installation
  and so on).  Note that the full installation needs around 3GB of disk space.

  teTeX-based ports and TeXLive are mutually exclusive.  This means TeXLive
  ports cannot be installed when teTeX is already installed.  You need
  to remove all of the TeX-related packages based on teTeX to try TeXLive.
  Migration procedure will be announced when conversion of the port
  dependency is completed.

  * Meta port
   - print/texlive-full: meta port to install all of the TeXLive components

  * Libraries
   - devel/tex-kpathsea: kpathsea library
   - devel/tex-web2c: WEB2C toolchain and TeX engines
   - print/tex-ptexenc: character code conversion library for pTeX

  * Base part of the TeXLive
   - print/texlive-base: binary programs in TeXLive
   - print/texlive-texmf: macro and font data in TeXLive
   - print/texlive-infra: tlmgr dependency (Perl modules)
   - print/tex-formats:

  * TeX Formats
   - print/tex-formats: TeX, LaTeX, PDFTeX, AMSTeX, ConTeXT, CSLaTeX,
       EplainTeX, METAFONT, MLTeX, PDFTeX, TeXsis
   - print/tex-aleph: Aleph/Lambda
   - print/tex-xetex: XeTeX
   - print/tex-luatex: LuaTeX
   - print/tex-jadetex: JadeTeX

  AFFECTS: users of security/libgcrypt and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The libgcrypt port has been updated to 1.5.2 and all shared libraries
  versions have been bumped. So you need to rebuild all applications that
  depend on libgcrypt. Do something like:

  # portmaster -r libgcrypt
    or
  # portupgrade -rf libgcrypt

  Alternatively, you may install sysutils/bsdadminscripts, run pkg_libchk and
  rebuild all detected ports:

  # pkg_libchk | tee /tmp/rebuild
  # awk -F':' '/libgcrypt.so/ {print $1}' /tmp/rebuild | sort | uniq \
	| xargs portmaster -D

  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/pkg, ports-mgmt/poudriere, ports-mgmt/tinderbox
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  This only affects people who are _building_ binary packages for pkgng. If you
  are building from ports please ignore this. This step is optional.

  It is recommended to rebuild all packages and then have your users run 'pkg
  check -Ba' and 'pkg upgrade' on their servers once. This will allow the new
  shlib tracking to reinstall packages that have changed shlib requirements.

  The affected ports have been converted to use libpaper for the default paper
  size as print/psutils did.  For more detail, see 20130424 below.

20130424:
  AFFECTS: users of print/psutils-a4 or print/psutils-letter
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  print/psutils-a4 and print/psutils-letter have been merged into a single port
  print/psutils.  The default paper size in psnup(1), psresize(1), and
  pstops(1) is now selected via an environment variable and/or a configuration
  file of libpaper(3).  For more detail, see papersize(5) and paperconfig(8)
  manual page.    If you prefer A4 or letter size by default as the old
  version did, please install print/papersize-default-a4 or
  print/papersize-default-letter, which installs a papersize configuration
  file without manual configuration.

  AFFECTS: users of */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  Due to some unexpected dynamic linking problems, Haskell Cabal ports with
  binaries that link to their own libraries may not work.  With default
  configuration, the following ports are known to have this problem:
  Agda, BNFC, pandoc, and uuagc.  (Their port revision are now bumped.)

  In general, it is recommended to rebuild the port if you are
  experiencing that the corresponding binary will not start, e.g.:

  % agda
  Shared object "libHSAgda-2.3.2-ghc7.4.2.so" not found, required by "agda"

  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  libiconv now handles the lib/charset.alias file instead of devel/gettext.
  If you are using pkgng 'and' upgrading from source with portupgrade or
  portmaster, first delete gettext, upgrade libiconv, then reinstall gettext.

  This will break sudo, so you *must* do this in a root shell (sudo -i)

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4-devel
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  The port was renamed into net/samba4 and is going to replace older
  development version of Samba4. You can upgrade it with:

  # portmaster -o net/samba4 net/samba4-devel

  In case you want to upgrade from net/samba36 make sure, that you've
  made backup of /usr/local/etc/smb.conf and the content of /var/db/samba/
  directory.

  There is no direct upgrade path from Samba3 to Samba4, but you can
  always try:

  # portmaster -o net/samba4 net/samba36

  Make sure you've read instructions from the supplied README.FreeBSD
  file and read all the relevant pages on http://wiki.samba.org/

  We still miss necessary support for Samba4 from base ntpd and bind9,
  port versions are also are not ready yet, but been worked on.

  Please note, that Samba4 is still in it's early days, so there are
  bugs both from my side and it's own, so be careful with placing it
  into production.

  AUTHOR: jhale@FreeBSD.org

  The update of devel/libvanessa_socket to 0.0.12 (used by Perdition)
  adds IPv6 support.  If the hostname in bind_address has both IPv4 and
  IPv6 addresses in DNS, then Perdition will ONLY listen on IPv6.

  If you prefer to continue to use IPv4, you need to change the
  bind_address in /usr/local/etc/perdition/perdition.conf to use an
  explicit IPv4 address.  This can be in addition to, or instead of,
  the current hostname, depending on whether you want to use IPv6 or
  not.  If your Perdition server does not have an IPv6 address
  listed in DNS, this change does not affect you.

  # portmaster -o sysutils/cfengine sysutils/cfengine33
    or
  # portupgrade -fo sysutils/cfengine sysutils/cfengine33
    or
  # pkg set -o sysutils/cfengine33:sysutils/cfengine

  Users that switch their port origin and later wish to remain on
  a particular cfengine release can override the default version by
  adding CFENGINE_VERSION to /etc/make.conf, where CFENGINE_VERSION
  is a value from:

    # make -V VERSIONS

  AFFECTS: users of textproc/docproj*
  AUTHOR: doceng@FreeBSD.org

  textproc/docproj no longer requires WITH_JADETEX to be set to 'yes' or
  'no', and by default, will enable the JADETEX dependencies.

  The textproc/docproj-jadetex port has been removed as a result of this
  change.

  Users that have installed textproc/docproj and have set
  WITH_JADETEX=no during compile time should update the package origin
  to use textproc/docproj-nojadetex:

  # portmaster -o textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-nojadetex
  or
  # portupgrade -fo textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-nojadetex
  or
  # pkg set -o textproc/docproj-nojadetex:textproc/docproj

  Users that have installed textproc/docproj-jadetex should update the
  package origin to use the textproc/docproj port:

  # portmaster -o textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-jadetex
  or
  # portupgrade -fo textproc/docproj textproc/docproj-jadetex
  or
  # pkg set -o textproc/docproj-jadetex:textproc/docproj

  Users that have installed textproc/docproj and have set
  WITH_JADETEX=yes will not need to make any changes.

  AFFECTS: users of audio/baresip
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Baresip is tightly linked to the versions of audio/re and audio/rem, and
  will not build against different versions.

  To update without problems, the -R flag for portupgrade is mandatory, or
  build will fail.  Portmaster and pkgng will handle this correctly.

20130103:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  VirtualBox has been updated and does now depend on devel/kBuild instead
  of devel/kBuild-devel. Both are in conflict with each other so this has
  to be resolved manually. kBuild is only a build dependency so it is safe
  to remove installed kBuild before updating.

  # pkg_delete -f kBuild-\*

20130102:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/opensmtpd
  AUTHOR: ashish@FreeBSD.org

  net-mgmt/netdot, ports-mgmt/tinderbox, ports-mgmt/tinderbox-devel
  sysutils/watchmen, www/MT

  The above mentioned ports were converted to depend on
  databases/p5-DBD-mysql. That will cause messages like

  ===>  p5-DBD-mysql-4.021 conflicts with installed package(s):
        p5-DBD-mysql55-4.021

  To prevent this run one of the following commands to fix the
  dependencies.

  # portmaster -o databases/p5-DBD-mysql databases/p5-DBD-mysql55

  AFFECTS: users of openldap24-client who uses SASL
  AUTHOR: Xin Li <delphij@FreeBSD.org>

  There is a change in the openldap24-client port which removes the SASL
  option.  If the user previously install openldap24-client, but enabled
  SASL from the config menu, the user would have to replace it with
  openldap24-sasl-client.

  AFFECTS: Users of www/owncloud
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  www/owncloud includes the entire WWWDIR directory structure in pkg-plist.

  This means that if you upgrade it, your config files are added to pkg-plist,
  and are then removed on the next deinstall.

  This issue has been fixed, but you must back up your install of owncloud and
  reinstall to avoid data loss;

  # cd /usr/ports/www/owncloud

20121104:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.16
  AUTHOR: az@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.16 has been updated to 5.16.2.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.16.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you are using binary packages with pkgng, not ports, do this instead of
  "perl-after-upgrade":

	# pkg install -fR perl

20121102:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash-completion
  AUTHOR: adamw@FreeBSD.org

  The bash completion library has been updated to 2.0, and the mechanism

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba36
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Startup rc.d/samba script was modified to address some problems with the
  fine control of supplementary daemons. As a side effect now it's always
  necessary to specify in rc.conf:

  samba_enable=YES

  to get the script working. You can still control each of the daemons
  individually, by disabling/enabling them with:

  nmbd_enable=NO
  smbd_enable=NO
  winbindd_enable=YES

20121015:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster
  AUTHOR: bdrewery@FreeBSD.org

  Portmaster now supports pkgng. To use pkgng, enable the patch in the port,
  enable pkgng in your make.conf, and convert your existing /var/db/pkg
  database. Also see UPDATING entry 20121010 if you are on a recent CURRENT
  and do not want to use pkg.

  This is optional and not currently required.

  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg install clean
  # make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster config build deinstall install clean

20121010:
  AFFECTS: users of CURRENT (OSVERSION >= 1000017)
  AUTHOR: bapt@FreeBSD.org

  The ports tree is now using pkgng as the default package manager
  for HEAD.  This only affects users of CURRENT -- users of other
  branches need not take any action.

  To keep pkg_install as the default package manager, use the new
  WITHOUT_PKGNG knob in make.conf

  To make the switch:

  1) Set WITHOUT_PKGNG=yes in make.conf and upgrade all your ports to
  the latest available versions using your favourite tools.

  2) Install ports-mgmt/pkg

  3) Remove WITHOUT_PKGNG from make.conf and run:

	# pkg2ng

  devel/clanlib has been updated to 2.3.6 and the legacy version has been
  moved to devel/clanlib1 and updated to 1.0.0.  Although both versions
  may be installed at the same time, you should update your port origins
  first since many ports that depend on clanlib will not work with the
  new version.

  Update your port origins as follows:

  # portmaster -o devel/clanlib1 devel/clanlib
    or
  # portupgrade -fo devel/clanlib1 devel/clanlib
    or
  # pkg set -o devel/clanlib:devel/clanlib1

  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk16, net/asterisk16-addons
  AUTHOR: Florian Smeets <flo@FreeBSD.org>

  asterisk16 has been unsupported upstream for a while now and has known
  security vulnerabilities, therefore it was removed from the ports tree.
  People still running net/asterisk16 should upgrade to net/asterisk.

  First delete the asterisk addons, as they are part of asterisk now.

  # pkg_delete -f asterisk16-addons\*

  AFFECTS: users of lang/erlang
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/erlang port was updated to R15B01. Some port options
  were updated, so be sure to run "make config" in the port directory
  and check your configuration before upgrading.

  To upgrade Erlang and rebuild all of the dependent ports under
  the new environment:

  # portmaster -r erlang
    or
  # portupgrade -r lang/erlang

20120815:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/erlang-lite
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  The lang/erlang-lite port uses the same default options as
  lang/erlang, which were changed some time ago.

  The couchdb, rabbitmq, freeswitch-core and freeswitch-core-devel
  ports have been updated to use lang/erlang rather than lang/erlang-lite.

  Please check that your lang/erlang options are configured as you
  wish (especially X11 support), then follow the instructions below
  to update your dependencies.

  # portmaster -o lang/erlang lang/erlang-lite
    or
  # portupgrade -fo lang/erlang erlang-lite

  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission-gtk2
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Unfortunately Transmission 2.61 moved the requirement for GTK to version
  3.2.0, which is not yet in our tree.

  Those who wish to have a graphical client can either choose transmission-qt4
  in the meantime, or switch to the transmission25 ports.

  functionality please look at the security/barnyard2 port.

20120723:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/ImageMagick and graphics/ImageMagick-nox11
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The options for ImageMagick have been changed to match commonly used

  reserved UID/GID 282 instead (user|group)next.

20120722:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mutt
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mutt-devel has been moved to mail/mutt, since 1.5 has been around
  for a while.

  # portmaster -o mail/mutt14 mutt

20120721:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/libogg
  AUTHOR: naddy@FreeBSD.org

  There is a new version of libogg (1.3.0) and the shared library version
  has been bumped (ogg.7 to ogg.8).  All ports that have an identifiable
  direct dependency on this library have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.
  However, some ports that pull in the library indirectly may continue to
  look for the old version.  To ensure that all are updated, perform this
  step:

  # portmaster -r libogg
  or
  # portupgrade -rf libogg

20120717:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The options of ProFTPD have been made much more user-friendly.
  As the modules are all shared libraries, all possible modules are built
  and installed. The following modules are now in separate slave ports:

  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_odbc: mod_sql_odbc
  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_sqlite: mod_sql_sqlite
  databases/proftpd-mod_sql_tds: mod_sql_tds
  net/proftpd-mod_ldap: mod_ldap and mod_quotatab_ldap

20120716:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  execute the command "postfix reload".

20120716:
  AFFECTS: Nobody
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  The FreeBSD ports tree switched from CVS to Subversion. A Subversion
  to CVS exporter is in place to continue the support of CVSup.

20120709:
  AFFECTS: users of math/metis
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  The older version of metis has been moved to math/metis4, and
  math/metis has been updated to 5.0.2.  Dependent ports still use
  the old API, and the different versions of metis cannot coexist, so
  most users should update with:

  # portmaster -o math/metis4 math/metis
  # portmaster -r math/metis4

  or the equivalent.

20120702:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/couchdb
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org, Adam Strohl <adams-ports@ateamsystems.com>

  The couchdb port has an unfortunate side effect; versions before 1.2.0
  will clobber local.ini.  The port will refuse to build if that file is
  present and an earlier version is installed, however no such protection
  can be afforded to package installation.

  To upgrade from 1.1.0 and earlier, simply move PREFIX/etc/couchdb/local.ini
  out of the way until the upgrade is complete.

20120702:
  AFFECTS: users of net-im/mikutter
  AUTHOR: tota@FreeBSD.org

  The net-im/mikutter has been updated to 0.1.1.810 which is required
  Ruby 1.9.2 or later. Before upgrading this port, please see the entry
  20110822 in this file to upgrade Ruby to 1.9.

  If you want to stay with 0.0.3 (requires Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2 or later),
  please run the following command:

  # portmaster -o net-im/mikutter003 net-im/mikutter
    or
  # portupgrade -o net-im/mikutter003 net-im/mikutter

20120630:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.16 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.12, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.16):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.16 -f perl-5.12.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.16 lang/perl5.12

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

  The default version for Perl has also been changed from 5.12 to 5.14.

20120623:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/xfce4-utils
  AUTHOR: xfce@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been discontinued, and installs files that conflict with
  the new versions of misc/xfce4-appfinder and x11-wm/xfce4-session.

  # pkg_delete -f xfce4-utils-\*
  # portmaster misc/xfce4-appfinder x11-wm/xfce4-session

20120618:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/db5
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/db5 port has been upgraded to BerkeleyDB 5.3.  This
  entails a shared library bump.

  Before upgrading this port, check if your applications use
  transactional data bases, and if they do, prepare them for a log file
  format upgrade.  YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE YOU UPGRADE THE DB5 PORT!  See:
  http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_02/html/upgrading/upgrade_process.html

  All packages that depend on db5 need to be rebuilt due to the shared
  library version change.  The full changelog is at
  http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/products/berkeleydb/html/changelog_5_3.html

  To upgrade the packages that need Berkeley DB 5, please
  issue one of the following commands (depending on your preferred tool):

  # portmaster -r db5-5
    or
  # portupgrade -fr databases/db5

20120616:
  AFFECTS: users of www/lighttpd
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The lighttpd startup script has been changed and is now compatible to the
  apache startup script. The "reload" subcommand now sends a SIGHUP to the
  process and triggers cycling of log files. The new command "graceful"
  performs a graceful restart (similar to former "reload") and "gracefulstop"
  performs a graceful stop. The "check" command has been replaced with
  the "configtest" command.

20120615:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/akonadi
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The latest Akonadi update includes critical bug fixes. Manual
  intervention is required for people using local MySQL database (the
  default configuration) as backend:

  $ akonadictl stop

  Wait a bit, and make sure that akonadiserver and akonadi_control are
  not running. Kill them if needed. Then, you have two alternatives:

  $ mysql_install_db --force \
    --defaults-file=~/.local/share/akonadi/mysql.conf \
    --datadir=~/.local/share/akonadi/db_data \
    --basedir=$(dirname `dirname $(which mysql_install_db)`)
  $ rm ~/.local/share/akonadi/mysql.conf

  ...or...

  $ rm -r ~/.local/share/akonadi

  In the latter case, Akonadi will have to recache your personal data
  (might take a while). Akonadi is only a cache, no data will be lost.
  Then:

  $ akonadictl start

20120613:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/djvulibre and graphics/djvulibre-nox11
  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  DjVuLibre been updated to 3.5.25.3.  The Qt 3.x GUI support that was in
  graphics/djvulibre has been removed (users of this GUI should consider
  switching to the new Qt 4.x GUI in graphics/djview4), and
  graphics/djvulibre-nox11 has been merged back into graphics/djvulibre.
  To update DjVuLibre, you can use:

  # pkg_delete djvulibre-\?.\*
  # portmaster -o graphics/djvulibre djvulibre-nox11

  You should then update any installed ports that link to the djvulibre shared
  library: converters/pdf2djvu, graphics/djview4, graphics/okular, and --
  if optional djvulibre support was enabled -- graphics/ImageMagick,
  graphics/apvlv, and graphics/evince.

20120612:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql-libpqxx
  AUTHOR: avilla@FreeBSD.org

  postgresql-libpqxx has been updated to 4.0. If you want to stick
  with version 3, install postgresql-libpqxx30:

  # portmaster -o databases/postgresql-libpqxx30 postgresql-libpqxx

20120612:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/gdal
  AUTHOR: sunpoet@FreeBSD.org

  Language bindings (Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby) have been moved to separate
  ports. Please install them if required. The new ports are:
    Perl binding:   graphics/p5-Geo-GDAL
    PHP binding:    graphics/php-gdal
    Python binding: graphics/py-gdal
    Ruby binding:   graphics/ruby-gdal

20120605:
  AFFECTS: users of net/p5-ZConf
  AUTHOR: vvelox@vvelox.net

  Please append '.set' to all sets for the FS backend. This was done to prevent
  collisions between config and set names. Previously the config
  "someConfig/default" would collide with the set "default" for "someConfig".

20120603:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: haskell@FreeBSD.org

  Note that The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler and the Haskell Platform
  have been updated to versions 7.4.1 and 2012.2.0.0, respectively.  At the
  same time, all Haskell ports have been updated to their latest working
  versions.

  To follow the changes, please issue one of the following commands

        portupgrade -fr graphics/png

20120531:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/koffice-kde4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KOffice 2 has been replaced by Calligra. You are encouraged to
  deinstall any KOffice port and install equivalent Calligra ones:

  # pkg_delete \*koffice\*
  # portmaster editors/calligra <additional l10n ports>

20120530:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql*-server
  AUTHOR: jgh@FreeBSD.org

  Affected users are those who use the crypt(text, text) function with
  DES encryption in the optional pg_crypto module. Passwords affected
  are those that contain characters that cannot be represented with
  7-bit ASCII. If a password contains a character that has the most
  significant bit set (0x80), and DES encryption is used, that character
  and all characters after it will be ignored.

20120530:
  AFFECTS: users of net/nss-pam-ldapd
  AUTHOR: scheidell@FreeBSD.org

  The net/nss-pam-ldapd port no longer provides an option for SASL. This has
  been sourced out to the new net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl port, to accommodate
  users using packages (see ports/162240). Users with openldap-sasl-client
  installed are encouraged to change the port's origin to:
  net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl using their favorite ports management tool.
  Example for portmaster:
  portmaster -o net/nss-pam-ldapd-sasl nss-pam-ldapd

20120527:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/qt4-gui

  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kdepim4, deskutils/kdepim4-runtime
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  kdepim4 has been updated to 4.8.3. For those who prefer old
  kdepim-4.4.11.1 deskutils/kdepim44* ports have been added.
  To stay with kdepim-4.4.11.1 run the following commands:

  # portmaster -o deskutils/kdepim44-runtime kdepim-runtime-4\*
  # portmaster -o deskutils/kdepim44 kdepim-4\*

20120525:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated to 4.8.3. Several ports were split,

  AFFECTS: users of lang/php5
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  PHP has been updated to 5.4. Suhosin patch has been disabled until the
  new version will be released (soon). Suhosing extension will take more
  time. LINKTHR option is now enabled by default, be sure to flag it if
  you are updating using an old saved configuration. sqlite2 extension
  has been permanently removed.
  If you want to remain at PHP 5.3, a new port (lang/php53) has been
  created for such purpose.

20120513:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/smokeping
  AUTHOR: lth@FreeBSD.org

  Smokeping has been updated to 2.6.7, and the web server configuration

  that your web server configuration is OK.

20120512:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/p5-XML-SAX
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  p5-XML-SAX (X-S) was split into p5-XML-SAX-Base (X-S-B) and p5-XML-SAX for
  version 0.99.  Since X-S-B now installs some files formerly installed by X-S
  the package for X-S must be deinstalled before updating X-S.

  # pkg_delete -fx p5-XML-SAX
  # portmaster textproc/p5-XML-SAX

  (users of pkgng can substitute pkg_delete with pkg delete)

20120511:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/xpdf
  AUTHOR: cy@FreeBSD.org

  In order to allow graphics/xpdf and graphics/poppler-utils to coexist,
  graphics/xpdf binaries have been moved from ${LOCALBASE}/bin to
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf. The symlink ${LOCALBASE}/bin/xpdf points to
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf/xpdf. However the other utilities installed by
  the xpdf port conflict with poppler-utils, no symlinks are maintained.
  Applicaions and scripts which use the pdf* utilities provided by
  graphics/xpdf must reference them using their new location, specify
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/xpdf in $PATH, or use the same utilities provided by
  graphics/poppler-utils.

20120510:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gitolite
  AUTHOR: milki@rescomp.berkeley.edu

  gitolite has been split into two ports: devel/gitolite for 3.x and
  devel/gitolite2 for 2.x

  gitolite 3.x is NOT "API" compatible with gitolite 2.x and requires
  additional manual migration steps which can be found in the online
  documentation.

  http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/install.html#migr

  Current users wishing to continue using gitolite 2.x should run:

  # portmaster -o devel/gitolite2 gitolite

20120430:
  AFFECTS: users of www/py-google-api-python-client
  AUTHOR: nivit@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 1.0.b8. This new version has important
  changes which might break your code:

  * apiclient.anyjson has moved to oauth2client.anyjson.
  * Some calls, for example, taskqueue().lease() used to require
    a parameter named body. In this new release only methods that
    really need to send a body require a body parameter, and so
    you may get errors about an unknown 'body' parameter in your call.
    The solution is to remove the unneeded body={} parameter

  See http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/wiki/PyDoc for
  more information.

20120426:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/libreoffice

  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  The latest update to these ports adds support to turn off
  the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols introduced in OpenSSL 1.0.1.
  These protocols are known to cause inter-operability issues
  with certain services, e.g. hotmail.  If using TLS with Postfix,
  please consult the RELEASE_NOTES for information about possible
  workarounds.

  AFFECTS: users of www/chpasswd
  AUTHOR: madpilot@FreeBSD.org

  Previous version of the chpasswd port put the configuration file
  in the pkg-plist, causing it to be removed on deinstall.

  Users are advised to make a backup copy of the configuration file
  before upgrading. This has been fixed and will not happen anymore
  in future updates.

20120415:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ircd-ratbox
  AUTHOR: scheidell@FreeBSD.org

  Ircd-ratbox has been updated to follow the current stable release
  branch (3.0.x). All previous branches are no longer supported by the
  ratbox team.

  Users of ircd-ratbox are advised to create new ircd configuration
  files based on the examples provided.

20120404:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/net-snmp
  AUTHOR: zi@FreeBSD.org

  The net-snmp startup script now specifies a new pid_file to avoid a
  conflict that existed with bsnmpd.  As a result, the startup script
  cannot find currently running versions of snmpd.

  You will need to either stop the daemon before upgrading or locate the
  PID of snmpd and manually kill it after upgrade.  Then, start the daemon
  as you normally would.

20120326:
  AFFECTS: users of www/tomcat7
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  Tomcat 7 startup script now uses 'jsvc' to monitor the daemon's process.
  A few rc.conf variables has been changed, be sure to adapt your
  configuration, if needed.

20120318:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dbmail
  AUTHOR: rm@FreeBSD.org

  no longer have access to your emails. See UPGRADING for details.
  Don't forget to backup and fully test before upgrading.

  To stick with version 2.2.x run:
  # portupgrade -o mail/dbmail22 mail/dbmail

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.8 and lang/perl5.10
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.8 and lang/perl5.10 have been removed since they've
  been EOL upstream for 3yrs and 2yrs respectively.  The default
  of lang/perl5.12 has not changed (yet).  Conditional checks for
  perl < 5.12 have been removed.  UNLESS you have PERL_VERSION=5.8.x
  or PERL_VERSION=5.10.x in /etc/make.conf you need take no action.
  If you do, you will have to recompile all perl dependant ports after
  updating your ports tree.  Please see entry 20110517 for help.

20120225:
  AFFECTS: users of archivers/libarchive
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

20120214:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/pcre
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  Until all dependent ports have been updated you should update pcre in
  a manner that will preserve its old shared library. For example:

  # portmaster -w devel/pcre
    or
  # portupgrade devel/pcre

20120213:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/ghc and */hs-*
  AUTHOR: pgj@FreeBSD.org

20120210:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  Postfix 2.9.0 contains several major changes, some of which could
  result in incompatible or unexpected behavior.  Regardless of the
  version from which you are upgrading, please carefully review the
  RELEASE_NOTES before proceeding.

20120126:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd and ftp/proftpd-mysql
  AUTHOR: Martin Matuska <mm@FreeBSD.org>

  The proftpd port has been updated to 1.3.4 and changed to use
  dynamically loadable modules. Please add corresponding LoadModule
  directives to your configuration file, like in the following example:

    LoadModule mod_tls.c

  The modules mod_sql_mysql and mod_sql_postgres are now outside of the
  main proftpd port:
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_mysql
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_postgres

  The proftpd-mysql port has been removed, use the alternative port:
    databases/proftpd-mod_sql_mysql

20120121:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/vdr
  AUTHOR: Juergen Lock <nox@FreeBSD.org>

  The vdr ports have been updated to 1.7.22 which involves at least
  two changes:

  - svdrpsend.pl is now called svdrpsend.

  - The ttxtsubs channels.conf format has changed so if you use that
    plugin you need to edit /usr/local/etc/vdr/channels.conf for the
    channels you want to receive teletext subtitles on - see:

        /usr/local/share/doc/vdr-plugin-ttxtsubs/HISTORY

20120116:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  From the upstream RELEASE_NOTES:

  Instead of terminating immediately with a "fatal" message when a
  database file can't be opened, a Postfix daemon program now logs
  an "error" message, and continues execution with reduced
  functionality.

  Specify "daemon_table_open_error_is_fatal = yes" to get the
  historical behavior (immediate termination with "fatal" message).

  Logfile-based alerting systems may need to be updated to look for
  "error" messages in addition to "fatal" messages.

  By default the Postfix SMTP server no longer reports transcripts
  of sessions where a client command is rejected because a table is
  unavailable.  To receive such reports, add the new "data" class to
  the notify_classes parameter value. The reports will be sent to the
  error_notice_recipient address as before. This class is also used
  by the Postfix SMTP client to report about sessions that fail
  because a table is unavailable.

20120116:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/xcb-util
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  x11/xcb-util was updated to 0.3.8 and was split in new modules.
  Dependencies were adjusted but main port symbols were moved to a single
  library, xcb-util.so.  For this reason, all dependent ports must be
  recompiled.If you use portmaster, run:

  # portmaster -R -r xcb-util-0

  Or for portupgrade:

  # portupgrade -r xcb-util-0\*

  AFFECTS: users of lang/newlisp
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  In lang/newlisp, the MYSQL5 and MYSQL51 options have been unified into
  MYSQL, which will pick the correct MySQL version using the standard
  MySQL selection logic. MySQL users will have to run "make config" and
  select the MYSQL option.

  Tinderbox users will have to update their options files with the new
  MYSQL option, and possibly change their Tinderbox environment to select
  a specific MySQL version.

  AUTHOR: bf@FreeBSD.org

  The new versions of flpsed and dillo have switched from
  x11-toolkits/fltk2 to the new fltk 1.3.0 from x11-toolkits/fltk.
  Users who have customizations specific to fltk2 may need to consult
  the fltk 1.3 documents in order to adjust their local settings. For
  dillo, some commonly-used key bindings have changed, and new
  configuration options are available: consult dillorc.dist and
  keysrc.dist for details.

20111019:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/thunderbird or www/seamonkey with lightning
           plugin installed.
  AUTHOR: gecko@FreeBSD.org

  To get an up to date version of lightning you should use the new
  LIGHTNING option in mail/thunderbird or www/seamonkey. This option
  is not enabled by default so you have to run "make config" prior
  to the build. The old deskutils/lightning-thunderbird and
  deskutils/lightning ports should no longer be used and will be
  removed very soon.

  Like other XPIs ports, lightning now registers itself as a global
  extension and doesn't create the XPI to be installed manually.
  Upgrading users should remove lightning from their profile before
  installing Thunderbird or SeaMonkey the first time with the new
  LIGHTNING option enabled.

20111018:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: Sahil Tandon <sahil@FreeBSD.org>

  The default smtp_address_preference value is now "any" instead
  of "ipv6", meaning choose randomly between IPv6 and IPv4. With
  this the Postfix SMTP client will have more success delivering
  mail to sites that have problematic IPv6 configurations.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-subversion-freebsd
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  devel/p5-subversion-freebsd has been removed as it is no longer necessary.
  If you have it installed please run the following to switch to
  devel/p5-subversion:

  portmaster -o devel/p5-subversion p5-subversion-freebsd

  Please also see the second entry below (20111016) if haven't upgraded
  subversion yet.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC has been updated to 4.7.2. A number of files were moved between
  packages and several ports were split, thus manual intervention into
  update procedure is required:

  # pkg_delete -f raptor-1\* kdelibs-4\* kdebase-\*4\* \
    kdeaccessibility-4\* kdeedu-4\* kdegames-4\* kdegraphics-4\* \
    kdesdk-4\* kdeutils-4\* konq-plugins-4\* ktts\* nepomukcontroller\* \
    ruby\*-kdebindings\* kdebindings-smoke\*
  # pkg_delete -f kdehier4\*
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/etc/pam.d/* \
    /usr/local/etc/pam.d/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d/* \
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/services/* \
    /usr/local/share/dbus-1/services/
  # mv /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/system-services/* \
    /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system-services/
  # rmdir /usr/local/kde4/etc/pam.d /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d \
    /usr/local/kde4/share/dbus-1/*services
  # rm -r /var/tmp/kdecache-*
  # portmaster misc/kdehier4

  If you have - or plan to install - net/kdenetwork4, also run:

  # portmaster -o net/linphone-base ortp

  Finally:

  # portmaster -a

  Also, remove /usr/local/kde4/etc/rc.d from local_startup in rc.conf(5).
  Failure to do this will cause all enabled scripts in /usr/local/etc/rc.d
  to be started twice.

  Remember to check for missing ports, bearing in mind that x11/kdebase4*
  ports were replaced by x11/kde4-* ones, ktts was replaced by jovie, while
  konq-plugins-kde4 and nepomukcontroller were removed. Then:

  # portmaster --check-depends

  You're also encouraged to run `pkg_cutleaves` or similar to check for
  orphaned ports.

  Please, note that `pkg_add -r kde4` will not install Plasma scriptengines
  and printer utilities by default anymore, and `pkg_add -r kdegames4` will
  not install Kajongg. This was made to avoid depending by default on
  kdebindings.

20111016:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion, devel/subversion-freebsd,
           devel/p5-subversion, devel/py-subversion,

           all dependand ports.
  AUTHOR: Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>

  Subversion was updated to version 1.7.0 and port was reworked.

  Now there is no "devel/subversion-freebsd" port. All FreeBSD-specific patches
  are incorporated into main subversion port as options, which are turned ON by
  default.

  These options are:

  P4_STYLE_MARKERS -- change conflict markers to P4 style,
                      established for FreeBSD projects.
                      This is not mandatory for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  ENHANCED_KEYWORD -- Support for custom keywords, like
                      $ FreeBSD $ in sources.
                      This is MANDATORY for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  FREEBSD_TEMPLATE -- Standard FreeBSD commit template.
                      It is RECOMMENDED for working with
                      FreeBSD sources.

  Also, subversion 1.7.0 changes the working copy format,
  and a working copy can not be shared between
  subversion 1.7.0 and 1.6.x. Please, think twice before
  upgrading.

  Additional the port "devel/subversion16" was created to
  support subversion 1.6.x. Subversion 1.7.x and 1.6.x
  can not be installed simultaneously!

  Binding ports can be built with Subversion 1.7.0 (Default)
  or with Subversion 1.6.x. To build bindings with subversion 1.6.x
  you should set variable WITH_SUBVERSION_VER to "16".

  There are several ways to upgrade, depending on what you used
  before and what you want to get after upgrade.

  (a) You use devel/subversion without FreeBSD patches and, maybe,
      some bindings. You want fresh'n'new subversion 1.7.0.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion && make config
  <deselect first three options described above, if you want it>
  # portupgrade -r devel/subversion
    or
  # portmaster -R -r subversion-1.6

  (b) You use devel/subversion-freebsd and, maybe, some
      bindings. You want fresh'n'new subversion 1.7.0, again
      with FreeBSD patches.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion && make config
  <make sure that first three options are selected>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portupgrade -r devel/subversion
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portmaster -R -r subversion-1.7

  (c) You use devel/subversion without FreeBSD patches and, maybe,
      some bindings. You want good old subversion 1.6.x, again
      without again.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion16 && make config
  <deselect first three options described above, if you want it>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion
  # portupgrade -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -r devel/subversion16
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion
  # portmaster -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -R -r subversion-1.6

  (d) You use devel/subversion-freebsd and, maybe, some bindings.
      You want good old subversion 1.6.x, with FreeBSD patches.
      Please, run:

  # cd /usr/ports/devel/subversion16 && make config
  <make sure, that first three options are selected>
  # portupgrade -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portupgrade -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -r devel/subversion16
    or
  # portmaster -o devel/subversion16 devel/subversion-freebsd
  # portmaster -m "WITH_SUBVERSION_VER=16" -R -r subversion-1.6

  AFFECTS: users of lang/erlang
  AUTHOR: Jimmy Olgeni <olgeni@FreeBSD.org>

  Following the R14B04 upgrade the JAVA, X11, WX and ODBC port
  options have been set to OFF by default; this will allow to replace
  lang/erlang-lite with lang/erlang for headless operation in the
  near future.

  If you need any of these options, run "make config" in lang/erlang
  before upgrading, or set your make.conf accordingly.

20111003:
  AFFECTS: users of math/qhull
  AUTHOR: Stephen Montgomery-Smith <stephen@FreeBSD.org>

  The port math/qhull has been moved to math/qhull5, and math/qhull has been
  updated to a version that is incompatible with all ports previously using
  math/qhull.  If you are upgrading a port that has math/qhull as a dependency,
  please delete the port math/qhull first, so that math/qhull5 is properly
  made as a dependency.

  AFFECTS: users of 10-current
  AUTHOR: eadler@FreeBSD.org

  There are known issues installing ports on FreeBSD 10+ due to
  bogus assumptions by various build scripts. This will not be fixed
  until 9-RELEASE is released.

  There are two workarounds:

  1) Set UNAME_r=9.9-CURRENT in your environment
  2) Set REVISION="9.9" in  ${SRCDIR}/sys/conf/newvers.sh

  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  unbound supports GOST from version 1.4.12 but only if dns/ldns was build
  with GOST support too. There is no way to check the option when unbound
  builds, so you should make sure the option is on in both unbound and lds.

  to rebuild the affected ports.

20110830:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/racket
  AUTHOR: olgeni@FreeBSD.org

  Racket has been upgraded to version 5.1.3. Due to the recent rewrite of
  the Racket graphics handling code, it is no longer possible to build
  this port without X11.

  The WITHOUT_X11 switch now controls if X11 is brought in as
  USE_GNOME/LIB_DEPENDS or BUILD_DEPENDS.

  In the latter case you will be able to build a Racket package that can
  then be deployed on a headless server.

  AFFECTS: users of security/maia
  AUTHOR: Janky Jay, III <ek@purplehat.org>

  There have been many changes to the maia port, including renaming the rc
  script and variables from maia to maiad.  You will need to replace any
  instances of maia with maiad in /etc/rc.conf, as well as renaming /var/amavisd
  to /var/maiad.  The 'vscan' user's home directory also needs to be changed to
  /var/maiad.

  These can be done by:

  # mv /var/amavisd /var/maiad
  # sed -i.bak -e "s/^maia_/maiad_/" /etc/rc.conf
  # pw usermod vscan -d /var/maiad

20110828:

  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  Along with new features and bug fixes, amavisd-new 2.7.0 introduces some
  incompatibilities with previous releases.  Several variable defaults, SQL
  schemas, and other changes warrant a careful review of the RELEASE_NOTES.
  Also note that helper programs amavis.c and amavis-milter.c are no longer
  distributed with this package; for milter functionality, please shift to
  the dedicated security/amavisd-milter port.

  AFFECTS: users of java/openjdk6
  AUTHOR: jkim@FreeBSD.org

  java/openjdk6 has been updated to b23 and "WEB" option (for web browser
  plug-in and Java Web Start) has been deprecated. If you need the same
  functionality, rebuild the port with "ICEDTEA" option first, then install
  a new port java/icedtea-web with "PLUGIN" option (default). Also, if you
  have a symlink to the previous IcedTeaPlugin.so in ~/.mozilla/plugins,
  for example, you need to remove it. Note system-wide symlinks are now
  automatically created by java/icedtea-web for your convenience.

20110619:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ezbounce and irc/ezbounce-devel
  AUTHOR: flo@FreeBSD.org

  irc/ezbounce-devel was moved to irc/ezbounce as the version previously in
  irc/ezbounce has been broken for some time and the distfile is not available
  anymore.

  If you are upgrading from a 1.0X version make sure to verify that your config
  still works. There is basic compatibility for old config files but a lot has
  changed, see http://linuxftw.com/ezbounce/files/CHANGES

  If you run irc/ezbounce-devel you need to run one of the following commands:

  # portmaster -o irc/ezbounce irc/ezbounce-devel

20110618:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/mailscanner
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  mail/mailscanner no longer requires running of any renew-* targets to
  update the config files / wrapper scripts; it is now automatically
  performed as the port is installed -- these targets have been removed.

  As an added bonus, the binary package now performs these steps as well,
  in case you don't have a portstree handy.

  Before upgrading, please backup your PREFIX/etc/MailScanner,
  PREFIX/share/MailScanner and PREFIX/libexec/MailScanner if you
  have customised any of these directories, just in case.

20110607:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/p5-Moose and devel/p5-Class-MOP
  AUTHOR: az@FreeBSD.org

  p5-Moose has been updated to 2.0007. Now p5-Class-MOP is a part of the
  p5-Moose distribution. Manual intervention of the update procedure is
  required:

    # portmaster -o devel/p5-Moose devel/p5-Class-MOP
    # portmaster -R -r p5-Moose-\*

  or do the same things with portupgrade.

  To check everything went fine you can run:
    # perl -Moose\ 999
  and
    # perl -MClass::MOP\ 999
  in both cases you should see output:
  version 999 required--this is only version 2.0007

20110606:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/sympa
  AUTHOR: crees@FreeBSD.org

  Sympa previously used to install to ${PREFIX}/sympa, which goes against
  the general rules for hierarchy. Most files which were previously found
  in ${PREFIX}/sympa should now be found in ${PREFIX}/libexec/sympa.

  Any configuration in httpd.conf files etc will need to be updated to the
  new directory.

  Before upgrade, it is advisable to back up configuration files
  ${PREFIX}/etc/sympa.conf and wwsympa.conf since previous versions wipe these
  out on deinstall.

20110606:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mariadb
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The mariadb port has been split into -client, -scripts, and -server ports

  AUTHOR: nikola.lecic@anthesphoria.net

  KMFL keyboard ports are now shared between IBus and SCIM KMFL IMEngines
  (textproc/ibus-kmfl and textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine). Thus, the prefix
  'scim-' is dropped from keyboard ports names.

  Similar to m17n, both engines now search engine-neutral locations,
  ${LOCALBASE}/share/kmfl/ and ~/.kmfl/. Users have to move their local
  keyboard files from ~/.scim/kmfl/ to ~/.kmfl/.

20110523:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_perl2
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  mod_perl2 was updated to version 2.0.5, this version includes

  # portmaster -R -r mod_perl2

20110522:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox-ose
  AUTHOR: vbox@FreeBSD.org

  The emulators/virtualbox-ose port has been updated to 4.0.8. If you

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.14 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.12, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.14):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.14 -f perl-5.12.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.14 lang/perl5.12

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

  AFFECTS: users of net/skype, net/skype-devel, net-im/skype, net-im/skype-devel
  AUTHOR: Ion-Mihai Tetcu <itetcu@FreeBSD.org>

  All skype ports were moved to net-im/:
  - skype12: unchanged, very old version (for FreeBSD 6)
  - skype20: last version with OSS support, that used to live in net/skype; the
  DISTFILE is gone from the vendor but if you happen to have it, it would be a
  way of having sound w/o needing to upgrade your base OS
  - [RECOMMENDED] skype: currently at 2.1.0.81 and the best supported
  - skype-devel: currently at 2.2.0.25, sounds is OK, video doesn't work

  To run either skype or skype-devel with fully working sound you need:
  - to run fc10 (most probably, please report what you can do with fc4):
  (OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f10,OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f10
  in /etc/make.conf for systems that doesn't have it as default)
  - In order for Skype to work OK, you need your kernel and modules to be:
	- post 2011-05-03 in on HEAD
	- post 2011-05-08 in on 7,8-STABLE
  The port tries to catch if your system version is too old, but there's a
  ~3months window where because of a lack of OSVERSION bump, this is not
  possible. So please check; and PLEASE READ THE PKGMESSAGE for setup details.
  For how to update your kernel/world, see:
  http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html

  IF YOUR OSVERSION IS NOT NEW ENOUGH, SOUND (ESPECIALLY MIC) WON'T WORK.

  If you run into problems, at very least we need to know the output of:
  $ uname -a; sysctl compat.linux | head -2; \
    grep OVERRIDE_LINUX_ /etc/make.conf; \
    cat /compat/linux/etc/alsa/pcm/pcm-oss.conf
  the skype version you are using and hardware details (eg. webcam, if related)
  I most probably will ignore any mail not containing this info since without
  it it's impossible to help.
  Please test your sound /video setup outside skype before blaming skype /
  mailing me.

  AFFECTS: users of audio/musicpd
  AUTHOR: Chris Rees <utisoft@gmail.com>

  Musicpd now installs the binary for the server as bin/musicpd, rather than
  mpd, to remove a conflict with net/mpich2; before upgrade you should run:

  # /usr/local/etc/rc.d/musicpd stop

  Likewise, mpd.conf has been renamed musicpd.conf-- if you want to keep it
  as mpd.conf then place MPDCONF="mpd.conf" into /etc/make.conf, otherwise
  after upgrade run:

  # mv /usr/local/etc/mpd.conf /usr/local/etc/musicpd.conf

  AFFECTS: users of net/openldap24-client
  AUTHOR: delphij@FreeBSD.org

  OpenLDAP has been upgraded to 2.4.25.  In this version, certain library
  routines were moved from liblutil to libldap.  If you previously built
  the library with "FETCH" support, this would cause libldap to depend on
  FreeBSD's libfetch.so library.


  As of 20110402, a local change have been introduced so OpenLDAP libraries
  link against libfetch.so when FETCH is enabled.  Normally, no further user
  interaction would be required.

  For new installations, the FETCH option have been turned off by default.

20110324:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4

    or
  # portmaster -o www/firefox36 www/firefox
  # portmaster -o www/firefox36-i18n www/firefox-i18n (if installed)

  Do not select the OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS option on a system with less then
  2 GB of RAM otherwise you will run out of memory during the build.

  Please make sure all your addons are compatible with Firefox 4.0 and
  backup your ~/.mozilla directory prior to the first launch of Firefox
  4.0.

  The startup script has been renamed from firefox3 to firefox.

20110319:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-client
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The shared library version of the client library was increased to reflect
  ABI changes, and avoid compatibility problems with the client library
  in MySQL 5.1, so client programs that use the 5.5 client library should
  be recompiled against the 5.5.10 client library.
  This can be achieved with:

  # portmaster -r mysql-client-5.5
    or
  # portupgrade -fr mysql-client-5.5

20110318:
  AFFECTS: users of www/node and www/node-devel
  AUTHOR: araujo@FreeBSD.org

  The port www/node was merged with www/node-devel since there is no longer a
  development version. Also www/node has not followed the stable upstream
  prior to this update.

  To keep www/node updated in your applications, from now on you must use
  www/node instead of www/node-devel. If you have been using the www/node-devel,
  you must run one of the following commands to upgrade:

  # portmaster -o www/node www/node-devel
    or
  # portupgrade -o www/node www/node-devel

20110317:
  AFFECTS: users of www/uzbl
  AUTHOR: Klaus Aehlig <aehlig@linta.de>

  The port has been updated to version as of 2011/02/15. This introduces
  the following incompatabilities.

  - $UZBL_FIFO, $UZBL_TITLE are available to scripts as environment variables,
  but not as command-line arguments.
  - environment variables are no longer expanded by the config parser
  - download handling has changed
  - cookie daemons are no longer supported

  Users are advised to change their personal configuration files/scripts accordingly.

20110316:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/duplicity
  AUTHOR: peter.schuller@infidyne.com

  sysutils/duplicity has been upgraded to 0.6.11. The old version
  (0.5.20) is retained as sysutils/duplicity05. Duplicity 0.6 should
  be generally compatible, but pay special attention to the new meaning
  of the --archive-dir command. In particular, the archive dir is now
  mandatory and defaults to ~/.cache/duplicity. You may have to
  --exclude accordingly.  In addition, it is recommended you consult
  the CHANGELOG, specifically the "New in v0.6.00 (2009/06/08)" section
  which details the checkpoint/restore feature (enabled by default) and
  its implications.

20110313:
  AFFECTS: users of astro/boinc-setiathome-enhanced
  AUTHOR: rene@FreeBSD.org

  The setiathome client has been updated to version 6.12.  Before you
  update, finish and report your current workunits to avoid losing them.

20110304:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python* and py-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Python has been changed from 2.6.x to 2.7.x.
  If you have 2.6.x installed, perform an upgrade of lang/python26 to
  lang/python27 with one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python27 lang/python26

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python27 lang/python26

  If you want to retain 2.6.x as default Python version, set the
  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION variable to 'python2.6' (without quotes) in
  /etc/make.conf, then go to lang/python and perform the following
  command:

  # portupgrade -R python

  Once the installed Python has been updated to 2.7, by using the
  method above, it is required to run the upgrade-site-packages target in
  lang/python to assure that site-packages are made available to the new
  Python version.

  If using portupgrade:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  If using portmaster:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages -DUSE_PORTMASTER

  The portmaster case can take quite some time to complete due to the lack of
  cached information that the portupgrade suite uses (specifically pkg_which).
  This is not the fault of portmaster.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/jasperserver
  AUTHOR: jhelfman@experts-exchange.com

  (taken from release notes of 4.0 from vendor)
  If you are upgrading from an older JasperServer version such as 3.5 then
  you must first upgrade to JasperServer 3.7 before upgrading to 4.0.
  Upgrading directly from JasperServer 3.5 to 4.0 is not a "certified"
  (i.e. fully QA tested) procedure.

  The steps to carry out this operation are fully documented in the
  JasperReports Server Installation Guide for the 3.7 release.  You will
  need to download the JasperServer 3.7 release package to get the relevant
  files and documentation. To download the JasperServer 3.7 WAR file
  distribution zip package, go to the JasperForge.org website and to the
  JasperServer project.

  Unison has been upgraded to version 2.40, which uses a different wire
  protocol than 2.32 did.  In order to support synchronization with
  other computers where Unison is still at version 2.32, a new port
  net/unison232 has been created.  It provides unison232 and if that is
  GTK2-enabled, also unison232-text.  This unison232 port can be
  installed in parallel with the existing net/unison port.

  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been updated to 5.12.3.  You should update everything

  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.12.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.12 from lang/perl5.{8,10} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20100715 in this file.

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  Postfix 2.8 introduces minor incompatibilities with previous versions.
  Alias expansion, dns lookups, TLS support, milters and other features
  are affected.  To avoid surprises, carefully review the RELEASE_NOTES.

  If you upgrade from Postfix 2.6 or earlier, you must execute "postfix
  stop" and "postfix start" before you can use the postscreen(8) daemon.
  This is needed because the Postfix 2.6 "pass" master service type did
  not work reliably on some systems. If you upgrade from Postfix 2.7, or
  from Postfix 2.8 before July 25, 2010, you must "postfix reload" (or
  "postfix stop" followed by "postfix start"). This is needed because
  the queue manager to delivery agent protocol has changed.

  Also note that the optional SPF and VDA patches have not been updated
  for Postfix 2.8; as a result, they are currently disabled.

  AUTHOR: decke@FreeBSD.org

  If you use 3rd party plugins that are incompatible with i18n >= 0.5.0
  (eg. variables in yml files as {{variable}}) then you need to

  # gem install -v=0.4.2 i18n

  Then upgrade the database as usual:

  # rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

  AFFECTS: users of mail/exim
  AUTHOR: rea@FreeBSD.org

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] The default value for system_filter_user
  is now the Exim run-time user, instead of root.

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY is no longer
  optional and is forced on.  This is mitigated by the new build
  option TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST which defines a list of configuration
  files which are trusted; one per line. If a config file is owned
  by root and matches a pathname in the list, then it may be invoked
  by the Exim build-time user without Exim relinquishing root
  privileges.

  [POSSIBLE CONFIG BREAKAGE] The Exim user is no longer automatically
  trusted to supply -D<Macro[=Value]> overrides on the command-line.
  Going forward, we recommend using TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST with shim
  configs that include the main config.  As a transition mechanism,
  we are temporarily providing a work-around: the new build option
  WHITELIST_D_MACROS provides a colon-separated list of macro names
  which may be overriden by the Exim run-time user.  The values of
  these macros are constrained to the regex ^[A-Za-z0-9_/.-]*$
  (which explicitly does allow for empty values).

  Upgrading users are encouraged to fully study
    ftp://exim.inode.at/exim/ChangeLogs/NewStuff-4.73

  libksba has been updated to 1.1.0, and the shared library version has
  increased from .17 to .18.

  Directly- and indirectly-dependent ports have had their PORTREVISION
  bumped to facilitate rebuilding.  Please rebuild the dependent ports
  with your preferred upgrading tool:

	# portupgrade -rf security/libksba
  -or-
	# portmaster -w -r security/libksba

  If there are still ports on your system that require ksba.so.17 (either
  in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg, or non-existent), _please_ file a PR so
  that a correct direct dependency can be added.

  Once you are satisfied that no ports still depend on the old shared
  library version (libksba.so.17), you can safely delete it from the
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg directory if it is present there.

  AFFECTS: autotools
  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  The next stage in the ongoing cleanup of autotools-using ports is
  a refactoring of bsd.autotools.mk so that version numbers are no longer
  needed within the USE_AUTOTOOLS stanza.  There is either
  autoconf213/autoconf or automake14/automake (for the legacy versions,
  and the currently available versions).  This will considerably reduce
  the amount of tree-wide patching in future on an update.

  IMPORTANT: if you have either devel/autoconf-wrapper or
  devel/automake-wrapper installed on your system (and you most likely do)
  PLEASE update these ports to their new versions before updating anything
  else -- Bad Things[tm] are likely to happen otherwise.

  AFFECTS: users of net/asterisk, net/asterisk-addons
  AUTHOR: Florian Smeets <flo@smeets.im>

  If you want to upgrade to 1.8.0 first remove asterisk-addons by running

  # pkg_delete -f asterisk-addons\*

  after that you can run one of the following

  # portmaster asterisk
    or
  # portupgrade asterisk

  You need to update your config files as the step from 1.4.x to 1.8.x is
  quite big. First you need to look at what changed between 1.4 and 1.6

  http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.8/UPGRADE-1.6.txt

  After that you also need to take into account what chagne between
  1.6 and 1.8

  http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk/branches/1.8/UPGRADE.txt

  If you want to stay with asterisk 1.4.x please run

  # portmaster -o net/asterisk14 net/asterisk
  # portmaster -o net/asterisk14-addons net/asterisk-addons
    or
  # portupgrade -o net/asterisk14 net/asterisk

  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix, mail/postfix2[56]
  AUTHOR: sahil@FreeBSD.org

  As of Postfix 2.7.2, 2.6.8, 2.5.11:

  Postfix no longer automatically appends the system default CA
  (certificate authority) certificates, when it reads the CA
  certificates specified with {smtp, lmtp, smtpd}_tls_CAfile or
  with {smtp, lmtp, smtpd}_tls_CApath.  This prevents third-party
  certificates from getting mail relay permission with the
  permit_tls_all_clientcerts feature.  Unfortunately, this change
  may cause compatibility problems with configurations that rely
  on certificate verification for other purposes.  To get the old
  behavior, specify "tls_append_default_CA = yes".

  AUTHOR: lioux@FreeBSD.org

  metainfo_series is no longer a builtin. This should only affect
  you if you aren't using one of the series plugins (series,

  AFFECTS: users of databases/mysql55-server
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  If you are upgrading from a previous MySQL release, the server will exit
  during startup after finding that the proxies_priv table is missing.
  To create the table, start the server with the --skip-grant-tables
  option to cause it to skip the normal grant table checks, then run
  mysql_upgrade. Then stop the server and restart it normally.
  You can do this by temporarly setting the following line in rc.conf:

  mysql_args="--skip-grant-tables --skip-networking"

  AFFECTS: users of databases/py-bsddb3
  AUTHOR: wen@FreeBSD.org

  py-bsddb3 update to 5.1.0. This release drops support for Berkeley
  DB 4.1, and adds support for Berkeley DB version 5.1, brand new. If
  you need Berkeley DB 4.1 support, keep using pybsddb 5.0.0. If you

  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portmaster
  AUTHOR: Doug Barton <dougb@FreeBSD.org>

  The changes to bsd.port.mk in 1.652 require all portmaster users to
  upgrade to version 3.1 or later.  The best method to do this will be
  to use the port, rather than portmaster itself:

  # pkg_delete -f portmaster\*
  # cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster && make clean && make install clean

20101026:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba35
  AUTHOR: Timur Bakeyev <timur@FreeBSD.org>

  This is the latest stable release of the Samba3 distribution. It has
  been extended with the experimental support of the NFS4-like ACLs on
  ZFS partitions, thanks to the sysutils/libsunacl library by Edward
  Tomasz Napierala(trasz). This support haven't been tested thoroughly,
  so try it on your own risk.

  This port reverted back to the pre- net/samba34 layout of the
  directories and now they are again $PREFIX/etc/samba, /var/run/samba,
  /var/log/samba, /var/db/samba and /var/spool/samba respectively.

  In case, you are upgrading from net/samba34, please rename
  corresponding samba34/ subdirectories into samba/ ones. Upgrades from
  older versions of Samba and fresh installations should be seamless.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/llvm-devel who use clang
  AUTHOR: Brooks Davis <brooks@FreeBSD.org>

  The clang portion of devel/llvm-devel has been split out and now

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/zfsnap
  AUTHOR: Aldis Berjoza <aldis@bsdroot.lv>

  Since timestamp format changed you need to use -o option with -d
  option in order to be able to delete old snapshots. Note however that
  you don't need -o when creating new snapshots, unless you want to keep
  using the old timestamp format.

  See http://wiki.bsdroot.lv/zfsnap for more info.

20100927:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix-current
  AUTHOR: ohauer@FreeBSD.org

  Incompatibility with snapshot 20100912
  ======================================
  - If your DNSBL queries have a "secret" in the domain name, you must
    now censor this information from the postscreen(8) SMTP replies.
  - The postscreen "continue" action is now called "ignore". The old
    name is still supported but no longer documented.
  - The postscreen_hangup_action parameter was removed. Postscreen
    now always behaves as if "postscreen_hangup_action = drop".
  - The postscreen_cache_retention_time default was increased from
    1d to 7d, to avoid deleting results from expensive deep SMTP
    protocol tests too quickly.

  Incompatibility with snapshot 20100827
  ======================================
  - The Postfix SMTP client no longer appends the local domain when
    looking up a DNS name without ".".
    Specify "smtp_dns_resolver_options  = res_defnames" to get the old
    behavior, which may produce unexpected results.

20100924:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/nvidia-driver

  The p5-Compress-Zlib, p5-IO-Compress-Base, p5-IO-Compress-Zlib and
  p5-IO-Compress-Bzip2 ports have been replaced by p5-IO-Compress.
  Users of Perl 5.10 and higher do not need to install this module
  because it is already included in the standard perl distribution.

  AFFECTS: users of security/stunnel
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  In stunnel-4.34, the DH support is no longer configurable by the user,
  but always enabled when OpenSSL supports it instead.  This means that
  it will now most probably be enabled on the supported versions of FreeBSD.
  If this leads to problems with old SSL clients, I will look into making
  it configurable at build time again.

20100917:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk
  AUTHOR: marius@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/cdrtools-cjk port has been removed, as the required functionality is
  now available in cdrtools 3.0.0 in the standard sysutils/cdrtools port.

 20100915:
  AFFECTS: autoconf, automake
  AUTHOR: autotools@FreeBSD.org

  autoconf has been updated from 2.62 to 2.67 -- all ports depending on
  autoconf-2.62 have had their PORTREVISIONs update, so a standard
  port updating method will suffice.

  USE_GETTEXT has been extended to also accept 'build' and 'run' for
  ports which need devel/gettext as a BUILD- or RUN-time dependency only.
  No port should now be directly depending on devel/gettext in Makefiles.

20100915:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk
  AUTHOR: marius@FreeBSD.org

  Version 3.00 of sysutils/cdrtools breaks but at the same time also
  obsoletes sysutils/cdrtools-cjk as mkisofs now employs iconv for
  character conversion. Consequently sysutils/cdrtools-cjk is marked
  BROKEN and the use of USE_CDRTOOLS=cjk as well as USE_CDRTOOLS together
  with the WITH_CJK knob left in a broken state until bsd.port.mk is
  updated by portmgr@ accordingly. Once USE_CDRTOOLS is updated to no
  longer refer to sysutils/cdrtools-cjk the latter will be removed.
  Previous users of sysutils/cdrtools-cjk should switch to using
  sysutils/cdrtools instead, which might require not using the WITH_CJK
  knob until said update of bsd.port.mk has happened.

20100915:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.12
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 has been updated to 5.12.2.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.12.
  Please see its manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.12 from lang/perl5.{8,10} please
  follow instructions in the entry 20100715 in this file.

20100912:
  AFFECTS: ftp/curl
  AUTHOR: roam@FreeBSD.org

  With version 7.21.1, the cURL port is built with stricter compiler
  checking by default (the -Werror flag is passed to the C compiler,
  making it treat any warnings as fatal errors).  If you experience
  problems building cURL, re-run "make config" in the ftp/curl
  directory and disable the WERROR knob.

  The default lighttpd configuration file locations have changed.
  The main configuration file is now: $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
  and includes other configuration files from $PREFIX/etc/lighttpd/

  For compatibility with old-style configurations, if the lighttpd_conf

  AFFECTS: users of textproc/nltk
  AUTHOR: clsung@FreeBSD.org

  Nltk has been upgraded to 2.0b8 which depends on devel/py-yaml now.
  You need to deinstall nltk before upgrading, since the previous port
  will delete files installed from py-yaml during its deinstall phase.

  Use, for example:

    # pkg_delete nltk-2.0b7,1

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.12 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.10, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.12):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.12 -f perl-5.10.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	portmaster -o lang/perl5.12 lang/perl5.10

	Conservative:
	portmaster p5-

	Comprehensive (but perhaps overkill):
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches  more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20100626:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/ibus-mozc
  AUTHOR: daichi@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/ibus-mozc port has been updated to version 0.11.383.102,
  and separated into 5 ports to cope with upcoming new port
  japanese/scim-mozc.

    o japanese/mozc-server
    o japanese/mozc-tool
    o japanese/mozc-additions
    o japanese/ibus-mozc
    o devel/py-gyp-devel

  You can not upgrade with portupgrade or portmaster. To upgrade, you
  must deinstall japanese/ibus-mozc first and then install the new
  japanese/ibus-mozc.

  For example:

    # pkg_delete ja-ibus-mozc-0.11.365.102_1
    # portsnap fetch update

  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The security/libassuan port has been updated to version 2.0.0, and
  the applications listed above have been updated to use it as of versions
  1.1.0 and 2.0.15 respectively.  If you HAVE NOT updated your libassuan
  port as described in the 20100613 entry, you can simply update all 3
  ports together (libassuan, dirmngr if installed, and gnupg) using your
  normal upgrade path.  If you HAVE updated to libassuan-1, then you need
  to do the following before upgrading dirmngr and gnupg.

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o security/libassuan security/libassuan-1

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o security/libassuan libassuan-1

  If you use neither:

	pkg_delete -f libassuan*

  Please note, libassuan version 2.0.0 is now a shared library, so unlike
  the previous version it is now a runtime dependency and cannot be deleted
  after you are done building dirmngr and/or gnupg.

20100613:
  AFFECTS: users of deskutils/kdepim4, and  security/{gpa|opensc}
  AUTHOR: dougb@FreeBSD.org

  The security/libassuan port has been updated to version 2.0.0, however,
  the applications listed above are not yet compatible with it.  Therefore
  security/libassuan-1 has been created until they can be updated, and the
  ports listed above have been updated to depend on it.  You must first
  replace your existing libassuan with version 1 in the new location, then
  you can update the ports listed above normally.

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o security/libassuan-1 security/libassuan

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o security/libassuan-1 libassuan

  If you use neither:

	pkg_delete -f libassuan*

  All ports that have an identifiable direct dependency on these libraries
  have had their PORTREVISIONs bumped.  However, some ports that pull in
  the libraries indirectly may continue to look for the old versions.  To

	# portmaster -w -r gettext

  The upgrade of devel/gobject-introspection may fail because it is looking
  for libintl.so.8.  In this case, do the following:

	# cd /usr/ports/devel/gobject-introspection
	# make clean
	# make deinstall
	# make install clean

  Then continue your upgrade procedure normally.

  If there are still ports on your system that are looking for libintl.so.8
  (either in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg, or non-existent), _please_ file
  a PR so that a correct direct dependency can be added.

  Once you are satisfied that no ports still depend on the old versions (such
  as libgettextpo.so.4 and libintl.so.8) you can safely delete them from the
  ${LOCALBASE}/lib/compat/pkg directory if they are present there.

	   x11/xmobar, x11-wm/xmonad, x11-wm/xmonad-contrib
  AUTHOR: pgj@FreeBSD.org

  The following ports have been renamed to improve consistency among Haskell
  Cabal ports:

    - devel/darcs           -> devel/hs-darcs
    - ports-mgmt/porte      -> ports-mgmt/hs-porte
    - textproc/pandoc       -> textproc/hs-pandoc
    - x11/xmobar            -> x11/hs-xmobar
    - x11-wm/xmonad         -> x11-wm/hs-xmonad
    - x11-wm/xmonad-contrib -> x11-wm/hs-xmonad-contrib

  Please follow these steps below to update Haskell ports that you have
  installed:

  1) Reinstall the renamed Haskell port dependencies (see previous entry).
     Note that this will possibly require that you remove the affected leaf
     (aforementioned) ports as well;

  2) Reinstall the renamed application(s) you use.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/pylint
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The pylint user configuration files have been changed slightly in newer
  versions (>=0.20.0).  In some cases, older configurations might crash
  pylint at startup.

  If you run into startup problems, make sure you remove the .pylintrc
  configuration settings and the .pylint.d directory from your home
  directory:

	$ rm ~/.pylintrc
	$ rm -rf ~/.pylint.d

20100518:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/apr0, devel/apr1, www/apache20, www/apache22
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  devel/apr port has been renamed to devel/apr1.

  WITH_APR_FROM_PORTS=yes for www/apache22 has been dissolved and may be
  removed from your configuration files; devel/apr1 is always used now.

  Please manually delete apache-2.\* if installed _before_ updating using
  either portmaster or portupgrade:

	pkg_delete -f apache-2.\*

  Then, if you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o devel/apr1 devel/apr

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f -o devel/apr1 devel/apr

  Finally, reinstall Apache port if you deleted it earlier and update ports as
  usual (`XX' below is either 20 or 22):

	portinstall www/apacheXX

20100512:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache20
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  The rc.d script has been renamed:

	apache2.sh -> apache2

  You'll need to update any crons wrappers, etc. for the new paths.

20100511:
  AFFECTS: users of KDE SC 4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE SC ports have been updated from 4.3.5 to 4.4.3. A number of libraries
  was moved between packages. The recommended update procedure is to delete
  kdelibs-experimental*, kdebase-4*, kdebase-workspace-4*,
  kdebase-runtime-4*, kdepim-4*, kdepim-runtime-4*, and then update ports as
  usual and install desired KDE 4 ports:

    # pkg_delete -f kdebase-\*4\* kdepim-\*4\* kdelibs-experimental-\*4\*
    # portmaster -a (or portupgrade -aR)

  In order to enabled Nepomuk semantic desktop search you have to install
  databases/virtuoso (you don't need to manually configure or run virtuoso
  server).

20100511:
  AFFECTS: users of textproc/redland RDF engine
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  Redland RDF engine has been split into redland itself and rasqal engine.
  The recommended update procedure is to delete redland, then update ports
  as usual and install desired RDF ports:

    # pkg_delete -f redland-\*
    # portmaster raptor (or portupgrade -r raptor)

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/qt4-phonon, multimedia/qt4-phonon-gst,
	   multimedia/phonon, and multimedia/phonon-gstreamer
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  WITH_QT_PHONON global knob has been introduced to allow selection between
  multimedia/qt4-phonon* ports (a bit outdated Phonon, which is shipped with
  Qt 4) and multimedia/phonon* ports.  Since KDE SC 4.4 now requires fresh
  Phonon, multimedia/phonon* ports are installed by default.

  If you don't use KDE, you may set WITH_QT_PHONON=yes in /etc/make.conf
  and continue to use Qt 4 Phonon implementation ports.

  If you want to use KDE SC 4.4 (or if you want the latest Phonon), do not
  define WITH_QT_PHONON, delete multimedia/qt4-phonon* ports, and install
  multimedia/phonon*:

  If you use portmaster:

    portmaster -o multimedia/phonon multimedia/qt4-phonon
    portmaster -o multimedia/phonon-gstreamer multimedia/qt4-phonon-gst

  If you use portupgrade:

    portupgrade -f -o multimedia/phonon multimedia/qt4-phonon

  AFFECTS: users of mail/nullmailer on FreeBSD 6.X
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The nullmailer port was recently updated with an rc.d script to correctly
  daemonize nullmailer-send with daemon(8).  On FreeBSD 6.X, daemon(8) does
  not support "[-u user]" command-line switch, causing the nullmailer rc.d
  script failure to start nullmailer-send.

  Support for "[-u user]" command-line switch was recently MFC'd to 6-STABLE
 (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=bin/146266).  FreeBSD 6.X users
  should patch and install daemon(8) by one of the methods described below.

  If /usr/src is not yet populated, csup the 6-STABLE sources and run these
  commands:

    cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/daemon
    make install
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nullmailer start

  If /usr/src is already populated with sources from a previous 6.X release,
  use these commands:

    cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/daemon
    fetch 'http://people.freebsd.org/~glarkin/pr-links/daemon/patch-daemon.c'
    fetch 'http://people.freebsd.org/~glarkin/pr-links/daemon/patch-daemon.8'
    patch -p0 daemon.c < patch-daemon.c
    patch -p0 daemon.8 < patch-daemon.8

  AFFECTS: users of www/squid*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  Starting with squid* the directory containing the default cache and log
  directory was changed from $PREFIX/squid/ to /var/squid/.

  The default values for the following Squid configuration parameters have
  changed as shown below:

  cache_log from $PREFIX/squid/logs/cache.log to /var/squid/logs/cache.log
  cache_store_log from $PREFIX/squid/logs/store.log to /var/squid/logs/store.log
  pid_filename from $PREFIX/squid/logs/squid.pid to /var/squid/logs/squid.pid
  coredump_dir from $PREFIX/squid/cache to /var/squid/cache

  Please check whether you need to define any of these variables in your
  squid.conf to the old defaults explicitly before updating, especially if
  you have set up automated log processing or automated log rotation.  If you
  define pid_filename in your squid.conf, you should also set squid_pidfile
  to the same value in /etc/rc.conf, cf. $PREFIX/etc/rc.d/squid.

20100419:
  AFFECTS: users of math/libgmp4
  AUTHOR: ale@FreeBSD.org

  The default gmp version in FreeBSD is now 5.0.x.  The port directory
  changed from math/libgmp4 to math/gmp.  An entry has been added to MOVED
  and all depending ports revisions have been bumped, so the update should
  be handled correctly by usual port management tools such as portupgrade.

  Portmaster users, please do the following before upgrading ports that
  depend on gmp:

	portmaster -o math/gmp math/libgmp4

     - php5-ming
     - php5-mhash

  2) Rebuild lang/php5 and all ports that depend on it.

20100403:
  AFFECTS: users of net/dgd
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The kernel library has been separated from the main net/dgd port into its
  own net/dgd-kernel port so that all libraries are on an equal footing.
  This also reflects the split of the kernel library out from the main DGD
  distribution.

  If you wish to continue to use the kernel library you'll need to install
  net/dgd-kernel after updating to dgd-1.4.1_2.

20100330:
  AFFECTS: users of gstreamer-plugins-bad and gstreamer-plugins-good
  AUTHOR: kwm@FreeBSD.org

  AFFECTS: users of www/firefox
  AUTHORS: beat@FreeBSD.org, mandree@FreeBSD.org (Java plugin)

  The www/firefox port has been updated to 3.6.  From now on www/firefox
  will contain the most recent version of Firefox.  Older but still
  supported releases will be available in www/firefox3 and www/firefox35.

  In order to update to Firefox 3.6 please delete your older installed
  version of Firefox first and install www/firefox afterwards.  Please
  make sure all your addons are compatible with Firefox 3.6 and backup
  your ~/.mozilla directory prior to the first launch of Firefox 3.6.

  Note that in order to use Java with Firefox 3.6, you need to install
  java/openjdk6, build it with the "WEB" option enabled and use the Iced
  Tea plugin.  To achieve the latter, each user needs to create a
  symlink to the Icedtea plugin as described in the Browsers/Firefox and
  Java[tm] Plugin section in the handbook:

	ln -s /usr/local/openjdk6/jre/lib/IcedTeaPlugin.so \
	$HOME/.mozilla/plugins

  AFFECTS: users of Mesa3D libraries and x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
  AUTHOR: nork@FreeBSD.org

  If you want to use Mesa3D 7.6.1 and libdrm 2.4.17 rather than 7.4.4
  and 2.4.12, you must define WITHOUT_NOUVEAU global macro, at least,
  enabled on graphics/libGL*, graphics/libglut, graphics/dri,
  graphics/mesa-demos, and graphics/libdrm.  And please give up using
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau.

  At this time, I cannot enable latest Mesa3D and libdrm, because they
  break xf86-video-nouveau.  But old (current?) Mesa3D and libdrm do not
  break any drivers.

  AMD Radeon HD 2xxx/3xxx/4xxx users: If you use AMD Radeon HD [234]xxx
  series, please define WITHOUT_NOUVEAU global macro.  You can then use
  OpenGL Hardware Accelerator feature on these series.

  AFFECTS: users of net/samba4-devel
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  Default configuration file was moved to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/smb4.conf to
  avoid conflicts with the installed net/samba3?.  Also, userland utils
  are not installed by default, which should also help with the parallel
  setup of Samba3 and Samba4.

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of Qt 3 and KDE 3
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  When building qt33 and kdelibs3 (at least), while they are installed,
  because of -L/usr/local/lib being passed too soon, the currently installed
  libraries are used instead of the ones from the build.  This makes the
  build fail if you updated any of the libraries these Qt/KDE libraries are
  linked against (e.g. libjpeg).

  For the moment the workaround, when you get to this, is to move the old lib
  out of the way, e.g.:

    mv /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so.old && \
    cd /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/qt33/ && make && \
    mv /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so.old /usr/local/lib/libqt-mt.so && \

20100205:
  AFFECTS: users of net/samba34
  AUTHOR: timur@FreeBSD.org

  This port was developed with the generous help of Florent Brodin.

  The default passdb backend has been changed to `tdbsam'! That breaks
  existing setups using the `smbpasswd' backend without explicit
  declaration! Please use `passdb backend = smbpasswd' if you would like
  to stick to the `smbpasswd' backend or convert your smbpasswd entries
  using e.g. `pdbedit -i smbpasswd -e tdbsam'.

  The `tdbsam' backend is much more flexible concerning per user
  settings like `profile path' or `home directory' and there are some
  commands which do not work with the `smbpasswd' backend at all.

20100130:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/sdl_mixer and graphics/sdl_image

	portupgrade -fr graphics/sdl_image

20100125:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/openal and graphics/openal-soft
  AUTHOR: mva@FreeBSD.org

  The default OpenAL implementation was switched to audio/openal-soft.
  To update all ports correctly, the following steps have to be performed.

	pkg_delete -f openal-\*

  If you use portmaster:

	portmaster -o audio/openal-soft audio/openal
	portmaster -r audio/openal-soft

  If you use portupgrade:

	portupgrade -ro audio/openal audio/openal-soft

  If you want to stick with audio/openal, please specify the following ports
  make flag within /etc/make.conf (or an appropriate configuration file for
  your ports):

	WANT_OPENAL=si

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/policykit and sysutils/polkit
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Due to a recent change in sysutils/policykit, both sysutils/policykit,
  and sysutils/polkit need to be rebuilt, but in a certain order.  First,
  upgrade sysutils/policykit to 0.9_6.  Then, force rebuild and reinstall
  of sysutils/polkit.  If you do not do this, applications which depend
  on polkitd will fail.

20100113:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/virtualbox
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  Port has been renamed to emulators/virtualbox-ose to reflect that we are
  using the OSE version.  A separate port for the kernel modules has been
  created: emulators/virtualbox-ose-kmod.

  Please see http://wiki.freebsd.org/VirtualBox for update instructions.

20100107:
  AFFECTS: users of security/openvpn*
  AUTHOR: mandree@FreeBSD.org

  security/openvpn has been moved to security/openvpn20 and upgraded to 2.0.9.
  security/openvpn has been upgraded to 2.1.1, and security/openvpn-devel has
  been removed.

  Regular upgrades of the security/openvpn port should succeed without
  manual intervention, but if you want to stick to openvpn 2.0 or if you
  had been using openvpn-devel, manual intervention is needed, as
  follows:

  If you'd been using the security/openvpn-devel port, please use one of
  these commands for upgrading:

    portmaster -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn security/openvpn-devel

    portupgrade -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn security/openvpn-devel

  If you want to stick to openvpn 2.0, please use one of these two
  upgrade commands:

    portmaster -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn20 security/openvpn

    portupgrade -m-DDISABLE_CONFLICTS -o security/openvpn20 security/openvpn

20100106:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/websvn

  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/grok
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  The sysutils/grok port has been completely re-written. Configuration files

  When upgrading you'll need to run ./upgradedb; see UPGRADING file.

20091214:
  AFFECTS: users of net/grdc
  AUTHOR: avl@FreeBSD.org

  Grdc has been renamed to Remmina upstream, and the port was also renamed
  to reflect this.  After installing remmina port you will need to download
  the ``grdc2remmina.sh'' script and run it as your normal user(s) that
  have ~/.grdc.  The script will only create ~/.remmina directory and move
  grdc config files to the new path; it does not affect anything else.

	$ fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~avl/script/grdc2remmina.sh
	$ sh grdc2remmina.sh

20091213:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/zabbix, net-mgmt/zabbix-agent
  AUTHOR: Jim Riggs <ports@christianserving.org>

  In order to simplify configuration and better separate the different
  components of Zabbix, the former zabbix port has been split into three:
  zabbix-server, zabbix-proxy, and zabbix-frontend.  Each component has
  distinct functionality and may be installed independently on separate
  systems.  The existing zabbix-agent port remains.

  Additionally, the new zabbix-frontend port now (correctly) installs the
  PHP frontend in PREFIX/www/zabbix.  The old zabbix port installed the
  files in PREFIX/share/zabbix/php.  Web server configurations must be
  updated accordingly.

  Finally, Zabbix has been updated to version 1.8.  Not everyone may be
  able to upgrade from version 1.6 immediately, though, so 1.6.8 versions
  of the ports are also available as zabbix16-server, zabbix16-proxy,
  zabbix16-agent, and zabbix16-frontend.

20091206:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 0.11.1, which no longer enables kqemu by
  default (if built with KQEMU knob on), now you also have to explicitly
  pass -enable-kqemu (or -kernel-kqemu as with the previous versions)
  if you want to use it.  Also note the 0.11 stable branch is the last
  qemu branch that still supports kqemu, so if you depend on reasonably
  fast emulation on FreeBSD you should start looking for alternatives
  some time soon.  (VirtualBox?)

20091120:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfixadmin
  AUTHOR: Terry Sposato <tabmow@freenode.net>

  Due to a bug in the previous postfixadmin port, existing users need to
  backup their config.inc.php before they upgrade to postfixadmin-2.3 or
  later and put it in place after the upgrade is complete.

20091120:
  AFFECTS: users of security/f-prot
  AUTHOR: Tim Bishop <tdb@FreeBSD.org>

  The main f-prot command is now named fpscan.  Virus definitions are
  updated using the fpupdate command.  fpupdate will automatically run
  from periodic every day.  To disable set the following option in
  /etc/periodic.conf:

	fpupdate_enable="NO"

  The f-prot port now only works on i386.

20091118:
  AFFECTS: users of java/jboss5
  AUTHOR: Jonathan Chen <jonc@chen.org.nz>

  The JBoss directory structure has been reorganised to follow hier(7)
  guidelines more closely; in particular, transient and deployment files
  were moved to /var/jboss5, thus allowing /usr to be read-only.

20091118:
  AFFECTS: users of www/redmine
  AUTHOR: Bernhard Froehlich <decke@bluelife.at>

  After the upgrade you need to generate a session secret before restarting
  the application.  This is to protect you from cross-site request forgery.
  From your Redmine directory, simply run the following command once:

	# rake config/initializers/session_store.rb

  then upgrade as usual:

	# rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

20091114:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/win4bsd
  AUTHOR: Mario S F Ferreira <lioux@FreeBSD.org>

  The new port now depends on emulators/kqemu-kmod instead of installing
  its own version.  Therefore, you should make sure that no other kqemu.ko
  modules are installed:

	# pkg_delete -f win4bsd\*
  	# rm -f /boot/kernel/kqemu.ko
  	# pkg_delete -f kqemu-kmod\*
  	# portinstall emulators/win4bsd

  Do not forget to enable kqemu on rc.conf since win4bsd will not work
  without it.

  After the upgrade the server may fail to start due to changes in the
  default values of innodb_log_files_in_group and innodb_log_file_size,
  which differ from those in earlier 5.4 releases.

  You should discard the old InnoDB log files and let MySQL 5.4.3 create
  new ones.  It is necessary to shut down your current server cleanly so
  that no outstanding transaction information remains in the log.

  See here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.4/en/news-5-4-3.html

  AFFECTS: users of mail/heirloom-mailx
  AUTHOR: Alexander Logvinov <avl@FreeBSD.org>

  Since SourceForge switched to the new File Release System,
  mail/heirloom-mailx has wrong package name.  All users who have
  mail/heirloom-mailx installed after 22 August 2009 should run the
  following commands:

	# pkg_delete "\-mailx-12.4_1"
  or
	# rm -r /var/db/pkg/-mailx-12.4_1

  AFFECTS: users of archivers/lzmautils, archivers/lzmautils-devel
  AUTHOR: Christian Weisgerber <naddy@FreeBSD.org>

  The XZ Utils distribution has superseded LZMA Utils, so the xz port has
  been added and the lzmautils ports have been removed.  To perform the
  move, run one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:

	# portupgrade -o archivers/xz lzmautils\*

  If using portmaster:

	# portmaster -o archivers/xz archivers/lzmautils
  or
	# portmaster -o archivers/xz archivers/lzmautils-devel

  AFFECTS: users of www/epiphany, x11/yelp, graphics/librsvg2,
	   x11/toolkits/py-gnome-extras, and www/epiphany-extensions
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  The default Gecko provider has been changed from www/firefox to
  www/libxul.  Firefox 2.x is now marked FORBIDDEN for security reasons,
  and libxul is new, stable, and preferred Gecko provider.  Libxul uses
  the same Gecko engine as Firefox 3.0.x.

  Some ports may fail to upgrade or run when both www/firefox and libxul
  are installed on the same system.  To make sure everything runs smoothly,
  uninstall www/firefox, then install libxul, then upgrade the affected
  ports.

  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl5.10
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.10 has been updated to 5.10.1.  You should update everything
  that depends on perl.  The easiest way to do that is to use
  "perl-after-upgrade" script supplied with lang/perl5.10.  Please see its
  manual page for details.

  If you want to switch to lang/perl5.10 from lang/perl5.8 please follow
  instructions in the entry 20090328 in this file.

  AFFECTS: users of astro/celestia and KDE
  AUTHOR: danfe@FreeBSD.org

  Celestia can now be compiled with KDE 3 frontend (you can enable it with
  CELESTIA_UI=kde when building).  It is very feature-rich, as it offers
  contextual menus, toolbars, KDE integration, internationalization,

20090804:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon*, x11/kdebase4*, deskutils/kdepim4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE 4 has been updated to version 4.3.0.  KDE now uses qt4-phonon;
  multimedia/phonon and multimedia/phonon-gstreamer are deprecated in
  favor of their qt4 equivalents.  You can still use multimedia/phonon-xine
  however.  A number of files have been moved between packages.  The
  recommended update procedure is to delete phonon, phonon-gstreamer,
  kdebase-*4*, kdepim-4*, then update ports as usual and install desired
  KDE 4 ports:

    # pkg_delete -f phonon-4\* phonon-gstreamer\* kdebase-\*4\* kdepim-4\*
    # portmaster -a (or portupgrade -a)
    # cd ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde4 && make config && make install clean

20090804:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/dbus-qt4, devel/qt4-designer

  Install qt4-designer if needed.

20090802:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libtool15 and devel/libltdl15
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The devel/libtool15 and devel/libltdl15 ports have been moved to libtool22
  and libltdl22, respectively, then updated to 2.2.6a. You will need to run
  portmaster or portupgrade to properly perform the upgrade:

  If using portmaster:

	portmaster -o devel/libtool22 devel/libtool15
	portmaster -o devel/libltdl22 devel/libltdl15

  If using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o devel/libtool22 libtool-1.5\*
	portupgrade -o devel/libltdl22 libltdl-1.5\*

  After that, you will need to rebuild all ports that depend on libltdl.
  Since all dependent ports' PORTREVISIONs have been bumped, you can run
  portupgrade or portmaster with `-a' option to complete the upgrade.

20090801:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-drivers/xf86-video-nouveau
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  An updated libdrm and xf86-video-nouveau have been committed.  These

  multimedia/mlt.

20090613:
  AFFECTS: users of www/hudson
  AUTHOR: hq@FreeBSD.org

  Hudson is now running as a standalone process and no longer relies on
  Apache Tomcat.  As such, it should now be configured by defining
  hudson_* variables in rc.conf.  See comments from rc.d script for further
  details.

  The default setup is using the same port numbers and HTTP URL prefix as
  before in order to reduce the effort of upgrading the port.  Hence, it
  may conflict with some running Apache Tomcat instance.  To fix this
  problem, you may either deinstall www/tomcat6, or use the following
  settings in hudson_args from /etc/rc.conf:

    --httpPort=??? --ajp13Port=???

20090611:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache22
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Two rc.d scripts have been renamed:

	apache22.sh -> apache22
	htcacheclean.sh -> htcacheclean

  You'll need to update any crons wrappers, etc. for the new paths.

20090608:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/python* and py-*
  AUTHOR: miwi@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Python has been changed from 2.5.x to 2.6.x.
  If you have 2.5.x installed, perform an upgrade of lang/python25 to
  lang/python26 with one of the following commands:

  If using portupgrade:
  # portupgrade -o lang/python26 lang/python25

  If using portmaster:
  # portmaster -o lang/python26 lang/python25

  If you want to retain 2.5.x as default Python version, set the
  PYTHON_DEFAULT_VERSION variable to 'python2.5' (without quotes) in
  /etc/make.conf, then go to lang/python and perform the following
  command:

  # portupgrade -R python

  Once the installed Python has been updated to 2.6, by using the
  method above, it is required to run the upgrade-site-packages target in
  lang/python to assure that site-packages are made available to the new
  Python version.

  If using portupgrade:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages

  If using portmaster:
  # cd /usr/ports/lang/python && make upgrade-site-packages -DUSE_PORTMASTER

  The portmaster case can take quite some time to complete due to the lack of
  cached information that the portupgrade suite uses (specifically pkg_which).
  This is not the fault of portmaster.

20090606:
  AFFECTS: users of java/eclipse
  AUTHOR: glewis@FreeBSD.org

  The update to 3.4.2 changes the location of the metadata for eclipse to
  be more in line with what is used on other platforms.  This means that
  after the update plugins that have been installed by a user with the
  built in Update Manager will need to be reinstalled.

20090605:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/postfix
  AUTHOR: itetcu@FreeBSD.org

  Version 2.6.1 introduced a POLA violation by expecting aliases.db to be
  in /etc/mail/aliases.db (not /etc/aliases.db).  With this version the
  location is reverted to the right place.

  If you updated your installation to 2.6.1 you need to run newaliases(1)
  again after you installed 2.6.2.

20090603:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/font-mplus-ipa (and old japanese/ipa-ttfonts)
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  IPAUIGothic has been updated to a version included in IPA font
  version 002.03 and added as a separated port
  "japanese/font-ipa-uigothic".  And the font-mplus-ipa has been
  updated to remove the old IPAUIGothic.

  Thus the old ipa-ttfonts is almost equivalent to font-ipa +
  font-ipa-uigothic + font-mplus-ipa.  Note that these three packages
  have different licenses from each other.

20090601:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/cvs-devel
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  cvs-devel no longer installs /bin/cvs and /bin/cvsbug. These are now

  of this change with respect to your path.

20090531:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/viewvc
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  viewvc.conf and templates are not compatible to 1.0.x version, even the
  database scripts have changed.  For details see:

20090530:
  AFFECTS: users of Japanese and Chinese fonts
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  Ports for Japanese fonts have been reorganized in the following way:

	japanese/ipa-ttfonts -> japanese/font-mplus-ipa
	japanese/ipa-ttfonts -> japanese/font-ipa
	japanese/kochi-ttfonts -> japanese/font-kochi
	japanese/mplusfonts -> japanese/font-mplus
	japanese/sazanami-ttf -> japanese/font-sazanami
	japanese/shinonome -> japanese/font-shinonome
	japanese/umefont -> japanese/font-ume
	japanese/vlgothic -> japanese/font-vlgothic

  While basically these are port name changes for consistency,
  installation directories are also changed:

	font files -> ${PREFIX}/share/${PORTNAME}/*
	symlinks -> ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/{TTF,OTF,fontname,...}/*
	symlinks -> ${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/{TTF,OTF,misc,fontname,...}/*

  A user-visible one is that the directory name "TrueType" is replaced
  with "TTF".

  Also, japanese/font-std and chinese/font-std have been added as
  standard fonts used in the Ports Collection.  Currently they
  contain:

	std.ja_JP/Mincho
	std.ja_JP/Gothic
	std.ja_JP/Ryumin-Light
	std.ja_JP/GothicBBB-Medium
	std.zh_CN/STHeiti-Regular
	std.zh_CN/STSong-Light
	std.zh_CN/MSung-Light
	std.zh_CN/MHei-Medium

  under ${PREFIX}/share/fonts/.  They are just symlinks to
  corresponding font files.  The symlink names are based on popular
  PostScript font names.

  Applications should refer the font files via XLFD or fontconfig
  first.  If they need a direct reference to the font file, please use
  files in std.*/*.  This is because direct reference to a specific
  font name in an application configuration file makes the maintenance
  difficult when the font file name is changed, for example.

20090516:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/viewvc
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  OPTION APACHE2 has been changed to APACHE (WITH_APACHE)

20090410:
  AFFECTS: users of www/trac-email2trac
  AUTHOR: brooks@FreeBSD.org

  bin/email2trac.py and bin/delete_spam.py are now installed without the
  .py extension to make the suid run_email2trac work and match the online
  documentation.  If you were using them in scripts or alias entries, you
  will need to update paths accordingly.

20090401:
  AFFECTS: users of Fedora 8 Linux infrastructure ports
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  ATTENTION! Those ports are not default for any version of FreeBSD for now
  and may be used with FreeBSD versions 7.2 and above (8-CURRENT is better)
  using compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 and linux_base-f8. Please, note that
  2.6.16 is not fully supported on 7.x (ex., some syscalls are missing
  and cannot be MFCed due to a native FreeBSD ABI breakage).

  For more information about transition please read item "20070327: AFFECTS:
  users of emulators/linux_base-fc6". That note may be used for upgrading
  to linux_base-f8 and Fedora 8 Linux infrastructure ports as well.

  If you want to switch to linux-f8 ports, please define at /etc/make.conf:

	OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=f8
	OVERRIDE_LINUX_NONBASE_PORTS=f8

20090328:
  AFFECTS: users of lang/perl*
  AUTHOR: skv@FreeBSD.org

  lang/perl5.10 is out. If you want to switch to it from, for example
  lang/perl5.8, that is:

  Portupgrade users:
    0) Fix pkgdb.db (for safety):
	pkgdb -Ff

    1) Reinstall new version of Perl (5.10):
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portupgrade -o lang/perl5.10 -f perl-5.8.\*

    2) Reinstall everything that depends on Perl:
	portupgrade -fr perl

  Portmaster users:
	env DISABLE_CONFLICTS=1 portmaster -o lang/perl5.10 lang/perl5.8
	portmaster -r perl-

  Note: If the "perl-" glob matches  more than one port you will need to
	specify the name of the Perl directory in /var/db/pkg explicitly.

20090327:
  AFFECTS: users of security/clamav
  AUTHOR: garga@FreeBSD.org

  After version 0.95 clamav-milter does not accept parameters by command
  line.  If you are using $clamav_milter_flags on rc.conf to set its
  parameters you will need to move to new ${PREFIX}/etc/clamav-milter.conf.

20090319:
  AFFECTS: users of shells/bash3
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  With the addition of shells/bash version 4.x, people wanting to stick

	$ portupgrade -f -o shells/bash3 bash

20090318:
  AFFECTS: users of www/suphp
  AUTHOR: yzlin@cs.nctu.edu.tw

  The suPHP port has been upgraded to 0.7.x. This new version of suPHP has
  some new features and changes for the configuration file:

    - Multiple path (with patterns) & variable substitution support for
      docroots
    - Double-quoted strings at section '[handlers]'
      ex. application/x-httpd-php="php:/usr/local/bin/php-cgi"

  These changes may lead to internal server error if without modifications
  of the configuration file from previous version.

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of www/geeklog
  AUTHOR: beat@FreeBSD.org

  To follow the standards this port has received a small reworking.

  AFFECTS: users of net-im/ejabberd
  AUTHOR: skylord@linkline.ru

  ejabberd's UID and GID have changed (PR ports/105122). Users are advised
  to check all configuration files and data in /var/spool/ejabberd to
  ensure everything has the correct owner/group.

20090316:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/lire
  AUTHOR: edwin@FreeBSD.org

  Lire now requires DBD::SQLite, which uses SQLite 3.0.  This means that the
  Lire database format has changed.  If you have one or more old Lire stores,
  you will need to convert each of them from SQLite2 format to SQLite3 like
  this:

	$ sqlite oldstore.db .dump | sqlite3 newstore.db

  This assumes that you have both SQLite2 and SQLite3 installed on your
  system, and that the names of the command line interface for the old and

  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/mythtv
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  The upgrade from version 0.20 to version 0.21 should be transparent.
  Any changes to the database structure should be applied automatically.

  However, it is strongly recommended that you back up your database before
  installing a new version of MythTV.

  For example:

	$ mysqldump -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg -c > mythtv_backup.sql

  To restore (assuming that you've dropped the database):

	$ mysql -u root
	mysql>create database mythconverg;
	mysql>exit
	$ mysql -u mythtv -pmythtv mythconverg < mythtv_backup.sql

20090309:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/libusb on CURRENT
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  FreeBSD libusb20 was renamed to libusb in r189585 and thus, being fully
  compatible with libusb20, replaces devel/libusb on HEAD.  devel/libusb
  should not be used on these systems.  Users of libusb-dependent ports
  are advised to remove libusb package from their systems, and rebuild all
  libusb dependencies.  One of the possible ways to achieve this is
  listed below:

	# set tempfile=`mktemp /tmp/usbports.XX`
	# pkg_info -qR /var/db/pkg/libusb-* > ${tempfile}
	# pkg_delete -f /var/db/pkg/libusb-*
	# cat ${tempfile} | xargs portupgrade -f
	# rm -f ${tempfile}

20090309:
  AFFECTS: users of multimedia/phonon
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  multimedia/phonon port has been split into phonon itself, phonon-xine,
  and phonon-gstreamer backends.  After updating phonon port you have
  to install at least one backend; phonon-xine backend is recommended
  for KDE.

20090308:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to 0.10.0, which now uses the newer
  (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade emulators/qemu
  with the KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20090304:
  AFFECTS: users of comms/py-gammu
  AUTHOR: bsam@FreeBSD.org

  The port comms/py-gammu was incorporated into comms/gammu since
  1.23.0. Delete comms/py-gammu first and then deinstall/reinstall
  comms/gammu with option WITH_PYTHON_GAMMU=YES.

20090304:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xfce4
  AUTHOR: oliver@FreeBSD.org

  When upgrading from Xfce 4.4 to 4.6 make sure you uninstall the following
  ports:

	x11/libxfce4mcs
	sysutils/xfce4-mcs-manager
	sysutils/xfce4-mcs-plugins
	x11-themes/xfce4-icon-theme

  You may uninstall them before you start the upgrade procedure (preferred)
  or even afterwards when the upgrade went fine.

  Please also note that Xfce 4.6 does not come with an icon theme any more.
  Xfce 4.6 now depends on the Tango theme which is now installed by default.
  The default installation of Xfce is also adjusted to use this icon theme
  instead of the Xfce 4.4 standard Rodent theme.  If you are upgrading from
  Xfce 4.4 to 4.6 you probably still have the Rodent theme selected.  This
  will lead to several "missing" icons when starting up Xfce.

  Make sure to switch as well to the Tango theme.  To do this just open the
  Settings Manager and select Appearance.  Inside the Appearance dialog
  switch to the Icons tab and select the "Tango" entry in the list on the
  left side of the Icons tab.

  For enabling the Reboot/Shutdown functionality of Xfce's logout dialog
  please read the note which gets printed out after the installation of
  x11-wm/xfce4 about how to configure PolicyKit.

  AFFECTS: users of Tcl/Tk
  AUTHOR: mm@FreeBSD.org

  The default version of Tcl/Tk has been changed from 8.4 to 8.5.

  To restore old behavior and prefer using Tcl 8.4 with supported ports set
  WITH_TCL_VER=84 in /etc/make.conf. This has no effect on ports that have
  USE_TCL=yes or USE_TK=yes. They stick to the new default version and have
  to be updated by their maintainers to support other versions than default.

20090218:
  AFFECTS: users of www/zend-framework
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  A local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability was fixed in Zend Framework
  1.7.5. The LFI was present in the Zend_View::render() method, and
  allowed inclusion of scripts with relative path names, e.g.
  "../../../my/script/dir/myscript.php".

  If the script path name is hard-coded into the application and is not
  generated by user input, the vulnerability does not apply.  Because of
  this exception, the Zend Framework team has added a flag to disable
  the LFI protection in the render() method.

  Full details of the vulnerability, whether it applies to your
  application and how to disable the LFI protection in the render()
  method can be found here:

  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  KDE 4 has been updated from 4.1.4 to 4.2.0.  A number of applications
  have been moved between packages.  The easiest way to avoid various
  problems during update is to delete all KDE-4.1.4 ports and install
  KDE-4.2.0:

	# pkg_delete -f kde\*4.1.4\* automoc4-\*
	# portmaster -a (or portupgrade -a)
	# cd ${PORTSDIR}/x11/kde4 && make config && make install clean

20090207:

  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/hal has been updated and should now properly detect mice for

  users and moused should now work fine.

20090123:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-servers/xorg-server
  AUTHOR: rnoland@FreeBSD.org

  If you are using an older xorg.conf several config lines are no longer
  needed and will generate warnings when X is started.  RgbPath will cause
  X to fail to start, remove it from your config.

  Server 1.5.3 also really wants to configure its input devices via hald.
  This is causing some issues with moused and /dev/sysmouse.  There are
  couple of options for how to deal with it:

  1. Add Option "AllowEmptyInput" "off" to your ServerLayout section.
     This will cause X to use the configured kbd, mouse, and vmmouse
     sections from your xorg.conf

  2. Don't use moused.  If you want it to work with addon USB mice
     set this in rc.conf:

	moused_enable="NO"
	moused_nondefault_enable="NO"

  I'm working on fixing hald or the mouse driver or both.

20090123:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/libxcb

  AFFECTS: users of mail/claws-mail, mail/claws-mail-smime
  AUTHOR: netchild@FreeBSD.org

  The claws-mail port includes the S/MIME plugin itself now, it is not
  distributed as a separate plugin anymore. It can be enabled with the
  GPGME option in the port (disabled by default). If you use the S/MIME
  plugin, you should remove the mail/claws-mail-smime port before
  enabling GPGME and updating the mail/claws-mail port. People which
  already updated mail/claws-mail with GPGME enabled and a non-working
  S/MIME plugin need to deinstall mail/claws-mail-smime and reinstall
  mail/claws-mail.

20090118:
  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Deluge has been updated from 0.5.x to 1.x. The 1.x has been rewritten,
  so it is recommend for you to make the back up of your ~/.config/deluge. The
  configuration and plugins of 0.5.x do not work in 1.x. Deluge will picking
  up the old configuration and try to convert it to the newer format, but I
  wouldn't trust it to do it without the back up.

  If you prefer to stick with 0.5.x, you can use portmaster:

  	# portmaster -o net-p2p/deluge05 net-p2p/deluge

  or if you use portupgrade:

	# portupgrade -o net-p2p/deluge05 net-p2p/deluge

  AFFECTS: users of GNOME and GTK+
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  GNOME has been updated to 2.24.x.  You have to deinstall a few ports
  first before using portupgrade or portmaster in order to successfully
  upgrade your GNOME installation.  After successful upgrade, you have
  to reinstall gnome-session so the gnome.desktop session file is properly
  installed.

  Portupgrade users:

	# pkgdb -Ff
	(Answer "yes" to unregister gail while keeping gtk20.)
	(Answer "yes" to unregister fast-user-switch-applet while

  all your custom shortcuts will be lost after upgrade.

20090109:
  AFFECTS: users of any Mozilla and Opera products
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Java plugins now will no longer be picked up by automatically from
  these browsers.  Because all Java ports share the name of plugins file,
  I am thinking about someone or maybe me will need to write something
  similar to nspluginwrapper (but in shell script) that can add Java plugin
  in ~/.*/plugins/ when user requests one specific version of Java plugin
  if this user has more than one version of Java installed.  However, for
  now, you will have to add Java plugin in ~/.*/plugins/ manually.

20090107:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/unixODBC
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The databases/unixODBC port has been updated to 2.2.14.  While
  containing many bug fixes and minor feature adjustments, this version
  no longer ships with the (obsolete) MySQL ODBC driver.  MySQL ODBC
  driver users will probably want to use databases/mysql-connector-odbc
  instead.  The text-backed/flatfile driver (libtxtodbc) has also been
  removed by the developers but due to some demand may make a return in
  a future version or as a separate port.

	pkgdb -F
	portupgrade as usual

  Portmaster users:

	pkg_delete -f php5-pcre\*
	portmaster php5

  If you are using pecl ports you might need to force an update on them:

	portupgrade -f pecl\*
  or
	portmaster pecl

  If you have the pecl hash, json and/or zip extensions you need to replace
  them with the PHP5 bundled ones, e.g.:

	portmaster/portupgrade -o archivers/php5-zip archivers/pecl-zip
	portmaster/portupgrade -o devel/php5-json devel/pecl-json
	portmaster/portupgrade -o security/php5-hash security/pecl-hash

  If you build your INDEX locally and you tried to build it after the PHP
  update commit, you need to rebuild it _after_ you updated lang/php5:

	cd /usr/ports && make index

  or (if you use ports-mgmt/p5-FreeBSD-Portindex):

  AFFECTS: users of www/codeigniter
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  For certain installations, the following steps should be performed
  after the CodeIgniter 1.7.0 upgrade (taken from:
  http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/upgrade_170.html).

  >>> Update your Session Table

  If you are using the Session class in your application, AND if you
  are storing session data to a database, you must add a new column
  named user_data to your session table. Here is an example of what
  this column might look like for MySQL:

	user_data text NOT NULL

  To add this column you will run a query similar to this:

	ALTER TABLE `ci_sessions` ADD `user_data` text NOT NULL

  You'll find more information regarding the new Session functionality
  in the Session class page:

	http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/sessions.html

  >>> Update your Validation Syntax

  This is an optional, but recommended step, for people currently
  using the Validation class. CI 1.7 introduces a new Form Validation
  class (http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/form_validation.html)
  which deprecates the old Validation library. We have left the old one
  in place so that existing applications that use it will not break, but
  you are encouraged to migrate to the new version as soon as possible.
  Please read the user guide carefully as the new library works a little
  differently, and has several new features.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/sj3-server
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The sj3serv daemon in japanese/sj3-server port now uses "localhost"
  as the default listen address for security reason.  If you need
  the wildcard address (INADDR_ANY), you have to explicitly set
  "servername" to 0.0.0.0 in ${PREFIX}/etc/sj3/serverrc.

20081026:
  AFFECTS: users of japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3
  AUTHOR: hrs@FreeBSD.org

  The japanese/Canna and japanese/sj3 port have been split into
  japanese/canna-server and japanese/canna-lib, and japanese/sj3-server

  The corresponding port configuration option WITH_SQUID_COSS is still
  available but is a no-op for now.  If you currently use COSS storage with
  Squid 3.0 you need to disable it in squid.conf.

20080924:
  AFFECTS: users of ftp/proftpd
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  proftpd now stores its .delay and .scoreboard files in /var/run/proftpd
  instead of /var/run.  If you are updating an existing installation,
  adjust the following in /usr/local/etc/proftpd.conf:

	ScoreboardFile	/var/run/proftpd/proftpd.scoreboard

  Also of note: The third party modules, mod_codeconv, mod_comb, and
  mod_sql_tds are not compatible with this release and have been removed.
  They will be re-added when the respective authors provide updated versions.

20080909:
  AFFECTS: users of security/logcheck
  AUTHOR: glarkin@FreeBSD.org

  logcheck now stores its configuration files in /usr/local/etc/logcheck
  instead of /usr/local/etc.  If you are upgrading the port from version
  1.1.1 to version 1.2.54, copy the following files to a temporary location,
  in case they are removed during the upgrade:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.hacking
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.ignore
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck.violations

  e.g.:

	cd /usr/local/etc
	mkdir /tmp/logcheck.saveconf
	cp logcheck.hacking logcheck.ignore logcheck.violations* \
	   /tmp/logcheck.saveconf

  After the upgrade, integrate your local changes to the files listed
  above into the new configuration files found in the following directories:

	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/cracking.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.paranoid
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/ignore.d.workstation
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.d
	/usr/local/etc/logcheck/violations.ignore.d

  Please consult the following files for more information about
  logcheck rules and reporting levels:

	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck
	/usr/local/share/doc/logcheck/README.logcheck-database

  Also note that the upgraded port installs a crontab file for user
  "logcheck" that executes the logcheck script every hour and emails
  the results to root.  If the installation process cannot install
  the crontab file, it can be installed manually from
  /usr/local/share/examples/logcheck/crontab.in, e.g.:

	crontab -u logcheck /usr/local/share/examples/logcheck/crontab.in

  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/nagios and net-mgmt/nagios-devel
  AUTHOR: Jarrod Sayers <jarrod@netleader.com.au>

  The stable Nagios port has now been updated to version 3.0.3.  Upgrading
  to this version shouldn't require any configuration changes, but note that
  most sample configuration files were moved into objects/ directory.

  Nagios 2.12 is still available as net-mgmt/nagios2, use the following to
  remain on this legacy stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios2 net-mgmt/nagios

  Nagios 3.x development continues in net-mgmt/nagios-devel, users of this
  port in production use should consider switching to the stable branch:

	portmaster -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-mgmt/nagios net-mgmt/nagios-devel

  AFFECTS: users of math/ploticus
  AUTHOR: linimon@FreeBSD.org

  This is a major update.

  Deprecated: server-side image maps (use client-side instead); definition
  of categories within proc areadef (use proc categories instead); proc print.

  Discontinued attributes: proc processdata's stack; proc usedata's element,
  proc getdata's rotate, and proc defineunits (use the $changeunits()
  function instead).

  proc rangebar has been renamed proc boxplot and there are major
  functionality changes.  Any script that uses proc rangebar will need
  maintenance.

  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  With the default Makefile settings, most of the programs are now
  installed outside your $PATH, except for "git", "gitk", and some server
  side programs that need to be accessible for technical reasons.  Invoking
  a git subcommand as "git-xyzzy" from the command line has been deprecated
  since early 2006 (and officially announced in 1.5.4 release notes); use
  of them from your scripts after adding output from "git --exec-path" to
  the $PATH is still supported in this release, but users are again
  strongly encouraged to adjust their scripts to use "git xyzzy" form, as
  we will stop installing "git-xyzzy" hardlinks for built-in commands in
  later releases.

  AFFECTS: users of net/rabbitmq
  AUTHOR: pneumann@gmail.com

  The database schema has changed in this version of RabbitMQ.  If you
  attempt to start RabbitMQ-1.4.0 over top of a previous installation,
  it will fail, citing "schema_integrity_check_failed".  To correct this,
  delete your mnesia directory (/var/db/rabbitmq/mnesia) and restart
  the server.  Note that this will destroy all your durable exchanges and
  queues, and all your persisted messages!

20080816:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/assp
  AUTHOR: J.R. Oldroyd <fbsd@opal.com>

  The periodic(8) script no longer outputs to files in the assp directory.
  You should remove /var/db/assp/nightly.log and nightly.log.old by hand

  now come in your nightly system email.

20080815:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/rdiff-backup
  AUTHOR: vd@FreeBSD.org

  sysutils/rdiff-backup has been upgraded from 1.0.5 to 1.2.0.  This is
  an incompatible upgrade.  If you need the "old" 1.0.5, you can find it
  in sysutils/rdiff-backup10.

20080813:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  The layout of the ikiwiki.setup file has changed in a significant
  way in this release.  Old setup files will continue to work, but new
  features, like the new websetup interface, require a new format
  setup file.  You can convert old setup files into the new format by
  running the following command for all your ikiwiki.setup files:

	ikiwiki-transition setupformat ikiwiki.setup

20080812:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/spamdyke

  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/transmission
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Update to 1.3x, the net-p2p/transmission now is a meta-port. It depends on
  cli, daemon, and gtk2. If you don't want that, uninstall transmission and
  install net-p2p/transmission-cli by doing:

	portmaster -o net-p2p/transmission-cli net-p2p/transmission

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -o net-p2p/transmission-cli net-p2p/transmission

20080805:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/qt4
  AUTHOR: kde@FreeBSD.org

  The Qt 4 ports has been updated to 4.4.1.  With this update several ports
  specific problems have been fixed.  Qt 4 headers and libraries have been
  moved to include/qt4 and lib/qt4.  bsd.qt.mk defines QT_INCDIR and
  QT_LIBDIR now, which could be used in qt4-dependent ports if required.
  Before you start to update your ports, please force update of qmake4 and
  qt4-corelib ports.  Portmaster users can do:

	portmaster devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

  or, if you're using portupgrade:

	portupgrade -f devel/qmake4 devel/qt4-moc devel/qt4-corelib

20080804:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/git
  AUTHOR: wxs@FreeBSD.org

  Git's cvsps dependency has been switched from cvsps-devel to cvsps.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following before
  upgrading git:

	portmaster -o devel/cvsps devel/cvsps-devel

20080728:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius2
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  Upgrading the FreeRADIUS port used to replace all unmodified files
  in your configuration with the latest version from the sample
  configuration. This strategy has two disadvantages; over time your
  configuration became based on different versions of the sample
  configuration, also major changes to the sample configuration could
  leave your configuration in a confusing state.

  From version 2.0.5, your configuration is not touched if any
  configuration files have been modified.

  You are recommended to track changes in the sample configuration and
  keep your configuration in a version control system. I use Subversion
  (see the devel/subversion port) to track my changes. Keeping the sample
  configuration in a 'vendor branch' (see the Subversion book for more
  details) allows easy merging of changes from the sample configuration.

  *** IMPORTANT ***

  You are urged to move your configuration out of the default location
  (/usr/local/etc/raddb) before upgrading from 2.0.4 (or earlier)
  to 2.0.5 (or later). Once this upgrade is complete, remove the sample
  configuration that has been installed in the default location and
  move your configuration back to the default location.

  This is a one time procedure that will prevent unmodified files in
  your configuration from being deleted from your configuration and not
  restored during the upgrade. No customised files will be lost in any
  circumstances.

  The sample configuration in 2.0.5 has been reorganised: the
  configuration of most modules is now in the modules directory rather
  than in radiusd.conf. You are urged to rearrange your configuration
  to match this layout.

  There are several improvements in this version of the port, including
  a new pkg-message that will help new FreeRADIUS users to get started
  with the port, also new 'reload' and 'debug' commands for the rc.d
  script. Enjoy!

  In order to properly update x11-fm/nautilus and misc/shared-mime-info, do
  the following using portupgrade:

	# pkg_deinstall -fO nautilus
	# portupgrade shared-mime-info
	# portinstall -O nautilus

  Once misc/shared-mime-info has been updated, each user will need to run

  AFFECTS: users of www/ojs2
  AUTHOR: Greg Larkin <glarkin@FreeBSD.org>

  If you are upgrading from a prior version of ojs2, please backup your

20080721:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freenet6
  AUTHOR: Edwin Groothuis <edwin@mavetju.org>

  Please note that there has been a major update of this port (from
  version 2.x to 5.x) and that the name of the binaries and configuration
  files has changed from "tpsc" to "gw6c". The configuration files
  have to be copied from ${PREFIX}/share/examples/freenet6 to
  ${PREFIX}/etc again.

20080719:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-fm/gprename
  AUTHOR: Martin Tournoij <carpetsmoker@rwxrwxrwx.net>

  GPRename configuration files now live ~/.config/gprename instead of ~/, to
  upgrade use the following commands:

	% mkdir -p ~/.config/gprename
	% mv ~/.gprename ~/.config/gprename/gprename
	% mv ~/.gprename_log ~/.config/gprename/gprename_log

20080717:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/anjuta
  AUTHOR: gnome@FreeBSD.org

  Anjuta's neon dependency has been switched from neon26 to neon28.  The
  two are incompatible, so you will need to do the following to upgrade:

	portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26
	portupgrade anjuta

20080714:
  AFFECTS: users of www/squid
  AUTHOR: Thomas-Martin Seck <tmseck@web.de>

  www/squid has been updated to Squid 2.7.STABLE3.

  The update should be rather straightforward.

  The only noticeable change in the port is that the ICAP patch is no
  longer included; this is because this patch was unmaintained for a long
  time and its use was not really recommended.  Please consider moving to
  Squid-3 (currently available as www/squid30) if you need ICAP support.

  Squid 2.6 is still available as www/squid26 and will probably be removed
  from the Ports Tree by the end of 2008.

20080712:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/rrdtool
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  If you use language bindings, like the Perl's RRDs, please upgrade

20080711:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  The port has been deprecated and gtkdatabox has been updated. This was
  done so the port tracks vendor name. Please update by doing:

	portupgrade -o x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox x11-toolkits/gtkdatabox2

20080709:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki editpage form now uses the raw page name, not the page title,
  in its `page' CGI parameter.  You will need to rebuild any existing
  IkiWiki installations in order to update their `edit' links to the new
  format.

20080708:
  AFFECTS: users of emulators/qemu-devel
  AUTHOR: nox@FreeBSD.org

  The port has been updated to a 20080620 SVN snapshot, which uses the
  new (incompatible) kqemu-kmod-devel port that now also works for the
  32 bit "qemu" executable on amd64.  If you upgrade qemu-devel with the
  KQEMU knob on, you have to

	# pkg_delete kqemu-kmod-1\*

  the old kqemu version first if it is installed.

20080705:
  AFFECTS: users of www/ikiwiki
  AUTHOR: Henrik Brix Andersen <brix@FreeBSD.org>

  The IkiWiki search plug-in now uses www/xapian-omega as backend instead
  of textproc/hyperestraier.  You will need to update the configuration of
  any search enabled IkiWiki installations and rebuild them since the
  search form has changed.

20080704:
  AFFECTS: users of misc/shared-mime-info
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The misc/shared-mime-info has been updated to 0.40. The Mime Types caches
  have been changed a bit. If you have created any custom MIME types, you
  will need to run update-mime-database to update your local Mime Types
  caches:

	$ update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime/

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ratbox-services
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Configuration file and database changes have been made between the
  1.1.x series and the current release version of ratbox-services.

  It is highly recommended that services are stopped, and the proper
  upgrade procedure is followed as described in port's documentation,
  before restarting newly updated ratbox-services again.

  Please remember to backup the database before attempting an
  upgrade, as incorrectly upgraded database may be rendered unusable.

  The ratbox-services-1.2.x branch implements multi-language support.
  However, an inconsistency in the language indexing may result in
  errors. It is therefore recommended that the English default to be
  used until the next version release.

20080702:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/nocc
  AUTHOR: Alex Dupre <ale@FreeBSD.org>

  The Nocc configuration file has been moved into 'config' subdir.
  When updating, remove the old conf.php file and reconfigure Nocc.

20080701:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/subversion*
  AUTHOR: Lev Serebryakov <lev@FreeBSD.org>

  subversion now uses neon-0.28.x (www/neon28) port, and automatic
  portupgrade will fail because www/neon28 will conflict with installed
  www/neon26 port.

  You should upgrade neon library before subversion with the command:

	# portupgrade -o www/neon28 neon26

  Also, if you use any special subversion ports with bindings, you
  should upgrade these ports to clean subversion port with

	# portupgrade -o devel/subversion subversion-\*

  and install needed bindings (p5-subversion, py-subversion and/or
  ruby-subversion) after that.

  If you use subversion with bindings installed from devel/subversion
  with custom options, don't forget to install separate bindings ports
  after subversion upgrade.

20080630:
  AFFECTS: users of graphics/cairo, graphics/poppler*, and future users of www/firefox3
  AUTHOR: FreeBSD GNOME Team <gnome@FreeBSD.org>

  The poppler* ports have been updated to 0.8.3 and the shared libraries
  have changed.  Firefox 3.0 has been added to the tree as www/firefox3.
  These changes require that all dependent ports be updated.  You can do
  this in one of two ways:

	# portmaster pixman
	# portmaster \*cairo\*
	# portmaster -r poppler-0

  or:

	# pkgdb -Ff
	# portupgrade pixman\* \*cairo\*

  mach64 and r128 drivers are now separated out from the ati driver.
  These video cards are supported by x11-drivers/xf86-video-mach64
  and x11-drivers/xf86-video-r128 respectively. If you have one of
  the affected video cards and xorg.conf contains the following line:

	Driver	"ati"

  you must specify "mach64" or "r128". Alternatively, you may install
  x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati to get a wrapper driver.

  AFFECTS: users of science/gramps
  AUTHOR: Anders Troback <freebsd@troback.com>

  Before you upgrade from 2.x to 3.x you need to export your existing

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of irc/ircd-ratbox-devel
  AUTHOR: Beech Rintoul <beech@FreeBSD.org>

  Upgrading between different beta releases can cause problems when
  changes to the ban database schema have occurred.  The 'bantool'
  utility now comes with a -u switch that will check and update the
  ban database as necessary.

  Issuing 'bantool -u' is required when upgrading between beta releases
  and must not be done while the ircd is running.

20080624:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security
  AUTHOR: Marcelo Araujo <araujo@FreeBSD.org>

  The mod_security port has been updated from 1.9.4 to 2.5.5. Branch 1.9.x

20080617:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/nvi-devel
  AUTHOR: Wesley Shields <wxs@FreeBSD.org>

  editors/nvi-devel has been changed to install nvi, nex, and nview as

  you use this port.

20080616:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dkim-milter
  AUTHOR: Hirohisa Yamaguchi <umq@ueo.co.jp>

  Most of the command line options can now be set in configure files.
  So the default values (such as milterdkim_socket) are changed to blank.
  Upgrading users should check the values both in rc.conf and
  dkim-filter.conf.

20080612:
  AFFECTS: users of www/linux-opera
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  The Opera port has been updated from 9.2x to 9.5x.  A lot of things have
  been changed such as keyboard shortcuts[1]; new storage and indexing
  formats for mail and feeds; new search.ini; probably more that I have
  missed.  I do not know if the keyboard shortcuts and search.ini will be
  overwritten.  You will be asked whether you want mail and feeds to be
  converted to new format during start up.  Warning: there is no way to
  downgrade back to the old format.  Be sure to see the Changelog[2].

  [1] http://www.opera.com/support/search/view/884/
  [2] http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/950/

  It is probably best for you to back up your linux-opera directory in
  case until you have no problem with new Opera for a while.  Also, you
  might have to re-configure search and keyboard shortcuts if these were
  overwritten:

	# cp -Rp ~/.linux-opera ~/.linux-opera-bak

  If you are seeing an error of undefined symbols related to GTK+, it is
  because it needs newer linux-gtk2 that ports doesn't have. You can enter
  'opera:config#FileSelector|DialogToolkit' in the address bar and change
  from 0 to 1 in 'Dialog Toolkit' if it annoys you.  0 = auto detection,
  1 = QT, and 2 = GTK+.

20080610:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/svnmailer
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  Some of the config directives and sections allowed have changed.  You will

20080605:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/gettext (i.e.: YOU)
  AUTHOR: ade@FreeBSD.org

  As a result of the upgrade to gettext-0.17, the shared library version
  of libintl has changed, so you will need to rebuild all ports that
  depend on gettext:

	# portupgrade -rf gettext
	# portmaster -r gettext

  Given the scope and sheer number of dependent ports, it may be more
  advisable to simply blow away all existing install ports (after
  keeping any local configuration changes), and rebuilding from scratch.

20080603:
  AFFECTS: users of editors/emacs
  AUTHOR: Yasuhiro KIMURA <yasu@utahime.org>

  The port (editors/emacs) is updated to 22.2 and some of Emacs Lisp

  AFFECTS: users of security/amavisd-new
  AUTHOR: scheidell@secnap.net

  Amavisd-new 2.6.0 introduces several incompatibilities with prior versions.
  If you are upgrading from 2.5.4 or earlier, you will need to update your
  SQL schema.  If you have third party programs that access SQL tables, you
  will need to update those also.

  COMPATIBILITY WITH 2.5.4:

  - when using SQL for logging (e.g. for a pen pals feature) or for
    quarantining, SQL tables maddr, msgs, msgrcpt and quarantine need
    to be extended by a new field 'partition_tag';  see below for details;

  - when SQL logging (pen pals) or SQL lookups are used, one can choose a
    binary or a character data type for fields users.email, mailaddr.email,
    and maddr.email; now may be a good opportunity to change a data type
    to binary (string of bytes);  see below for details;

  - when using SQL for logging, a default for $sql_clause{'upd_msg'}
    has changed, so if a configuration file replaces this SQL clause
    by a non-default setting, it needs to be updated;

  Full information in /usr/local/share/doc/amavisd-new/RELEASE_NOTES.

  AFFECTS: users of audio/ampache
  AUTHOR: jadawin@FreeBSD.org

  Ampache 3.4 uses a different config parser.  Unfortunately the new parser
  is unable to read old config files.  In order to migrate your current
  configuration, you should run `php ${WWWDIR}/bin/migrate_config.inc' from
  the command line.

20080508:
  AFFECTS: users of databases/ptop
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The authors have changed the name of this utility to `pg_top'.  To avoid
  conflict with another port in the Tree with the same name we have retained
  `ptop' as the portname.  Note that binary has also changed to `pg_top'.
  Please start the utility with that name after updating.

20080507:
  AFFECTS: Perl interface users of audio/gramofile
  AUTHOR: rafan@FreeBSD.org

  Perl support is removed due to devel/swig11 removal in ports.  If you use
  the Perl interface, you are encouraged to use the new Audio::Gramofile
  found on CPAN (contact me for the ports).

20080506:
  AFFECTS: users of net-mgmt/collectd
  AUTHOR: daniel@roe.ch

  Previously, net-mgmt/collectd used to remove the config file even if it
  was changed by the user. This has now been fixed.

  To upgrade without losing your configuration, copy
  ${PREFIX}/etc/collectd.conf away to a safe place before upgrading
  net-mgmt/collectd.

  In addition, the default location of the data files changed from
  ${PREFIX}/var/lib/collectd to /var/db/collectd; you may want to move your
  data files and edit your configuration accordingly.

  AFFECTS: users of www/p5-Apache-Test
  AUTHOR: pgollucci@FreeBSD.org

  www/p5-Apache-Test doesn't actually need www/mod_perl{1,2}. If you would
  like to test a mod_perl, than please install www/mod_perl2 or www/mod_perl
  as well. The ports infrastructure doesn't support this (yet) but you can
  use it to test www/apache13, www/apache20, and/or www/apache22 without
  chaining www/p5-Apache-Test.

20080405:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/tracker
  AUTHOR: ahze@FreeBSD.org

  The sysutils/tracker port is now a meta port and tracker is now split into

  AFFECTS: users of net/skype net/skype-devel
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  For FreeBSD versions 7.0 and above:

  It is required with both skype and skype-devel to update to linux_base-fc6.
  Please do the following:

  1. Make sure there are no running Linux applications.
  2. Unmount linprocfs (umount /compat/linux/proc)
  3. Uninstall your current linux_base port
  4. Set appropriate sysctl (sysctl compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16)
  5. Install emulators/linux_base-fc6
  6  Remount linprocfs (mount /compat/linux/proc)
  7. Add compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.16 to etc/sysctl.conf
  8. Add OVERRIDE_LINUX_BASE_PORT=fc6 to /etc/make.conf

  Note: These instructions also apply to linux_base-f8, please use the same
  osrelease.

  For FreeBSD versions 5.X and 6.X:

  Please use the legacy version net/skype12:

	portupgrade -o net/skype12 net/skype

20080316:

  AFFECTS: users of mail/ezmlm-web
  AUTHOR: hans@nordhaug.priv.no

  The layout of ezmlm-web 3.2 is changed, please read documentation and
  the manual page of ezmlm-web.cgi.

20080312:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/enlightenment-devel, x11/ecore and grephics/evas
  AUTHOR: stas@FreeBSD.org

  Evas and ecore ports have been split to separate modules to simplify
  dependency tracking. Thus, portupgrade in many cases won't be able to
  correctly update these ports.

  The easiest upgrade path would be to remove all EFL ports and install
  them from scratch. At least, you should reinstall ecore and evas.

  Please note that your old $HOME/.e is no longer compatible with new
  snapshot version. You will need to remove this directory and let e17
  create it automatically on the next startup.

20080306:
  AFFECTS: users of mail/dovecot
  AUTHOR: ehaupt@FreeBSD.org

  The update to version 1.0.12 will require manual change to the active
  configuration file.

  mail_extra_groups setting was commonly used insecurely. This setting is now
  deprecated. Most users should switch to using mail_privileged_group setting,
  but if you really need the old functionality use mail_access_groups instead.

20080303:
  AFFECTS: users of security/gnutls and any port that depends on it
  AUTHOR: novel@FreeBSD.org

  gnutls has been updated to 2.2.2 and all shared libraries versions have
  been bumped.  So you need to rebuild all applications that depend on
  gnutls. Do something like:

	portupgrade -rf gnutls

20080223:
  AFFECTS: users of www/instiki
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  The default installation directory for instiki has changed from
  /usr/local/instiki to /usr/local/share/instiki.

  If you are updating from a previous version, to preserve your
  settings and data, please do the following:

	mv /usr/local/instiki /usr/local/share

  Then update as usual.

20080219:
  AFFECTS: users of x11-wm/xmonad
  AUTHOR: jacula@gmail.com

  From now XMonad uses a new configuration file system, so you don't have
  to edit Config.hs anymore.  Instead, create a custom configuration file
  ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs.  You can take a look at some samples on Xmonad's
  website.  Note that you can be interested in x11-wm/xmonad-contrib.

20080218:
  AFFECTS: users of devel/poco and devel/poco-ssl
  AUTHOR: lippemail@gmail.com

  The HashFunction class template has been changed in an incompatible way.
  The member function formerly named hash() is now the function call
  operator.  If you have defined your own HashFunction classes, then you
  have to update your code.

20080216:
  AFFECTS: users of sysutils/symon
  AUTHOR: uspoerlein@gmail.com

  The symon port has been updated from 2.75 to 2.78. It changes the wire
  protocol again. You should update your symux(8) and symon(8) installations
  simultaneously, as:

    - new symon clients will make old symux servers exit, and
    - new symux servers don't understand the old symon client's if() and
      mem() probes.

20080208:
  AFFECTS: users of ports-mgmt/portupgrade
  AUTHOR: sem@FreeBSD.org

  As was claimed in the entry 20070301 below in this file, you should fill
  ALT_DEPENDS section of pkgtools.conf for portupgrade to work correctly
  with your alternative dependencies.  Now it is an obligatory requirement.

  It was done as a compromise between speed and complexity.

20080203:
  AFFECTS: users of www/xshttpd
  AUTHOR: johans@FreeBSD.org

  www/xshttpd now uses ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/ as a root directory for its
  data files.  The xshttpd configuration files have been moved to
  ${PREFIX}/www/xshttpd/conf/.  Please move the appropriate local files
  manually if you are upgrading from 3.4 or older versions.

20080202:
  AFFECTS: users of www/punbb
  AUTHOR: beech@FreeBSD.org

  Install paths have changed. Please do the following prior to upgrade:

	cd /usr/local/www
	mv punbb punbb.old
	cp -R punbb.old/upload punbb

  It is now safe to update as usual.

  Notes:

  * You will probably get uninstall errors regarding files not found. It's
    safe to ignore them
  * Your webserver path has changed from www/punbb/upload to www/punbb,
    please adjust your webserver configuration and restart it
  * When you are satisfied with everything working properly you may remove
    the punbb.old directory:
	rm -r /usr/local/www/punbb.old

  AFFECTS: users of net-p2p/deluge
  AUTHOR: mezz@FreeBSD.org

  Deluge was updated to version 0.5.8.2.  If you are using blocklist plugin,
  you have to remove blocklist.conf first before you can run it, or it will
  crash upon start up.

	$ rm -f ~/.config/deluge/blocklist.conf

20080125:
  AFFECTS: users of www/mod_security2
  AUTHOR: araujo@FreeBSD.org

  Update of mod_security2 is a dramatic change, because there is a need
  to completely rewrite their obsolete rules and migrate for capacity to
  use new syntax.

  You are advised to make a complete backup of your configuration files
  before you can perform an update.

20080120:
  AFFECTS: users of www/apache20

  ('make show-options').

20080118:
  AFFECTS: users of net/freeradius
  AUTHOR: David Wood <david@wood2.org.uk>

  FreeRADIUS 2.0 is now available as the net/freeradius2 port. All FreeRADIUS
  users are advised to consider upgrading to 2.0. It is the FreeRADIUS team's
  intention to put the 1.x server into 'maintenance' mode with just critical
  bug fixes.[1] 2.0 has many improvements including numerous bug fixes that
  were too difficult for the 1.x server, as well as many new features.

  Before uninstalling 1.x, it is recommended that you backup your
  configuration, which is typically in /usr/local/etc/raddb, then move it
  out of the way. It is also worth backing up the default configuration,
  which is typically in /usr/local/share/examples/freeradius/raddb.

  1.x configurations should work with the 2.0 server [2]. However the port
  automatically upgrades any unedited files in the configuration when you
  install a new version of FreeRADIUS. Installing 2.0 with the residue of a
  1.x configuration in the default location will result in a mixed 1.x and
  2.0 configuration that may not work.

  The recommended approach is to diff your 1.x configuration against the
  default 1.x configuration, then make corresponding changes to a copy
  of the default 2.0 configuration. If you moved your 1.x configuration out
  of the way before upgrading, you will have a 2.0 configuration ready to
  edit in the default location. It is worth reading man 5 unlang for details
  of the new FreeRADIUS 'un-language' before starting.

  Alternatively, you can move your 1.x configuration to another location,
  such as /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1, then edit /etc/rc.conf to point the rc.d
  script to that location. For example:

	radiusd_flags="-d /usr/local/etc/raddb_v1"

  I cannot guarantee that all 1.x configurations will work with the 2.0
  server, and I only recommend using a 1.x configuration as an interim
  measure.

  AFFECTS: users of irc/bitlbee
  AUTHOR: brix@FreeBSD.org

  irc/bitlbee now stores saved user settings in /var/db/bitlbee/, not
  $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/.  You will have to manually move any existing user
  settings to the new location (or override the user settings directory
  using -d if you wish to keep the old behavior).  Other configuration
  files are still kept in $PREFIX/etc/bitlbee/ by default.

  The default installation is now configured for running bitlbee as user
  'nobody' by default.  Make sure any existing configuration files are
  readable by that user.
