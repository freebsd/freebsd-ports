This file documents some of the problems you may encounter when
upgrading your ports.  We try our best to minimize these disruptions,
but sometimes they are unavoidable.

You should get into the habit of checking this file for changes each
time you update your ports collection, before attempting any port
upgrades.

  AFFECTS: users of databases/postgresql7

  PostgreSQL 7.4.2 Released and release notes available at
  http://www.postgresql.org/news/173.html

  NOTICE: unlike most minor versions, this version does require some
  updates to the pg_* system tables. Full instructions for how to do
  this are included in the full HISTORY file.

  DO NOT UPGRADE WITHOUT READING THESE INSTRUCTIONS.

20040309:
  AFFECTS: users of x11/kdelibs and x11/kdebase

  If you update kdelibs from version 3.2.0 to version 3.2.1 while running
  a KDE 3.2.0 session, newly opened instances of Konqueror will silently
  crash as soon as the new version of kdelibs has been installed, due to
  mismatching linker symbols.

  It is recommended you quit your KDE session at that point and update
  kdebase to version 3.2.1, then restart KDE.

20040309:
  AFFECTS: users of audio/arts and x11/kdebase

  The arts port, PORTVERSION 1.2.1 does not include artswrapper anymore.
  Instead, artswrapper is now installed by a new port audio/artswrapper.

  Installation of artswrapper is optional, however:

  If you presently run KDE and you have "Run with the highest possible
  priority (realtime priority)" checked in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
  Sound System and you choose to NOT install audio/artswrapper, you need to

  - Uncheck "Run with the highest possible priority (realtime priority)"
    in Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/Sound System BEFORE updating arts

  OR

  - AFTER updating arts and kdebase, go to Control Center/Sound & Multimedia/
    Sound System, click on the unchecked "Run with the highest possible priority
    (realtime priority)", dismiss the message telling you that realtime is un-
    available or artswrapper is missing and then click Apply.

20040305:
  AFFECTS: users of security/antivir-milter

  When updating from a previous version of security/antivir-milter you
  have to do the following after deinstalling the old port:
      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir
      rm <PREFIX>/AntiVir/antivir.vdf
      chown root:wheel <PREFIX>/AntiVir
      chown root:smmsp <PREFIX>/AntiVir/hbedv.key
    In your SENDMAIL_MC change
      `S=unix:<PREFIX>/AntiVir/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:5m'
    to:
      `S=unix:/var/spool/avmilter/avmilter.sock, F=T, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:10m'
    and rebuild sendmail.cf.
    If /var/spool/avmilter exist you have to:
      chown -R smmsp:smmsp /var/spool/avmilter
    If you are using a customized <PREFIX>/etc/avmilter.conf the port
    won't remove it on deinstall and you have to manually change User
    and Group to smmsp there.
    Afterwards you can install the new version of this port. You then
    should run antivirupdater to get a current VDF.

20040226:
  AFFECTS: i386 users of ruby and portupgrade

  Change the default version of ruby to 1.8 for i386.

  If you are a ruby developer and want to keep ruby 1.6 as default,
  please add RUBY_DEFAULT_VER=1.6 to /etc/make.conf.

  Otherwise, please run the following series of commands to migrate to
  ruby 1.8:

  1) Reinstall portupgrade manually (and as a result ruby 1.8 will be
     installed):
	pkg_delete portupgrade-\*
	(cd /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade; make install clean)

  2) Reinstall everything that depends on ruby 1.6 to use ruby 1.8
     instead:
	portupgrade -fr lang/ruby16

  3) Reinstall ruby 1.8 (because the previous step kills symlinks):
	portupgrade -f lang/ruby18

  4) Deinstall ruby 1.6 stuff (if you are paranoia):
	pkg_deinstall -ri lang/ruby16

  5) If the above commands do now work somehow and portupgrade starts
     causing LoadError, please reinstall portupgrade manually again.
     Whenever you get confused, you can always deinstall portupgrade
     and all the ruby stuff (run "pkg_delete -r ruby-\*") and
     reinstall portupgrade as a last resort.

20040204:
  AFFECTS: 5.2-CURRENT users who started with a 5.2-RELEASE or older.

  Change the default version of perl to 5.8.

  1) Force perl-5.6.1 to be upgraded with perl-5.8.
        portupgrade -o lang/perl5.8 -f perl-5.6.1_15

  2) Update all p5-* modules.
	portupgrade -f p5-\*
