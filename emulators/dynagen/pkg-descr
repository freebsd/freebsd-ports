Dynagen is a front-end for use with the Dynamips Cisco router
emulator. It uses an INI-like configuration file to provision
Dynamips emulator networks. It takes care of specifying the right
port adapters, generating and matching up those pesky NIO descriptors,
specifying bridges, frame-relay, ATM switches, etc. It also provides
a management CLI for listing devices, suspending and reloading
instances, etc.
