XMAME is an arcade game machine emulator for UNIX/X11.  It will emulate
the hardware, video, sound, and other services, of many classic arcade
game machines.

As of this release, XMAME supports an incredible 2843 arcade games, and 
the number grows every day!  A partial list of the (more popular and
well-known) games currently supported by this emulator include:

PacMan, Ms. PacMan, Jr. PacMan, Super PacMan, Dig Dug, Star Trek, Galaga,
Space Invaders, Tempest, Frogger, Mr. Do!, Battle Zone, Missile Command,
Gyruss, Kangaroo, Moon Patrol, Phoenix, Q*Bert, Rally X, Robotron,
Star Wars, Zaxxon, Bubble Bobble, Snow Bros, ... you get the idea.

To run these games, however, you will need images of the ROM chips that
are used on these games.  If you actually have one of these games (or the
motherboard to one of them), and access to a ROM burner, it is a fairly
trivial process to make ROM image files for use with XMAME.  If you DON'T
have access to a ROM burner, or you don't own one of these video games
(and you are aware of the possible legal ramifications of doing this),
you can obtain ROM images for XMAME on the Net.
