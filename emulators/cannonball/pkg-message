$FreeBSD$

In order for Cannonball to work you need to provide a copy of the
OutRun revision B romset to the roms subdirectory. Rename the files if
necessary.

The roms subdirectory can be found at $XDG_DATA_HOME/cannonball/roms
which defaults to $HOME/.local/share/cannonball/roms

Configuration can be found at $XDG_DATA_HOME/cannonball/config.xml
which defaults to $HOME/.local/share/cannonball/config.xml

NOTE: The directories will be created on the first run of Cannonball
if they do not exist.
