The QEMU Guest Agent is a daemon intended to be run within virtual machines.
It allows the hypervisor host to perform various operations in the guest,
such as:

* get information from the guest
* set the guest’s system time
* read/write a file
* sync and freeze the filesystems
* suspend the guest
* reconfigure guest local processors
* set user’s password
