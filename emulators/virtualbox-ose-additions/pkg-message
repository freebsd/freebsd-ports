  message: <<EOM
VirtualBox Guest Additions are installed.

To enable and start the required services:

# sysrc vboxguest_enable="YES"
# sysrc vboxservice_enable="YES"

To start the services, restart the system.

In some situations, a panic will occur when the kernel module loads.
Having no more than one virtual CPU might mitigate the issue.

For features such as window scaling and clipboard sharing, membership of
the wheel group is required. With username "jerry" as an example:

# pw groupmod wheel -m jerry

The settings dialogue for FreeBSD guests encourages use of the VMSVGA
graphics controller. Whilst this might suit installations of FreeBSD
without a desktop environment (a common use case), it is not appropriate
where Guest Additions are installed.

Where Guest Additions are installed:

1. prefer VBoxSVGA

2. do not enable 3D acceleration (doing so will invisibly
   lose the preference for VBoxSVGA)

You may ignore the yellow alert that encourages use of VMSVGA.
