This port contains packages from a near-minimal installation of Fedora 10
Linux.  These packages, in conjunction with the Linux kernel module,
form the basis of the Linux compatibility environment. It is designed to
provide a nice user experience by using the FreeBSD configuration for
corresponding Linux stuff where possible. Because of this any work which
needs to chroot into the Linux base may not work as expected (no fallthrough
to the FreeBSD config possible).
