The port provides the enabled by default DEINIT option. It deinits the renderer,
application window and audio system when an emulator is launched. This can save
some resources while playing the actual games, but also benefits audiophile
users, who provide only exclusive access to the audio device with the sysctl
dev.pcm.%d.play.vchans=0. Without the DEINIT option enabled, ES-DE will keep the
audio device open and prevent the launched emulator from also opening it in this
case, effectively disabling sound on the emulator.
