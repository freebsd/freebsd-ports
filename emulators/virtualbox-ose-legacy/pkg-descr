Oracle VirtualBox is a family of powerful x86 virtualization products 
for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely
feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it
is also the only professional solution that is freely available as
Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Non-legacy i.e. emulators/virtualbox-ose is recommended for most use cases. 

Where legacy (5.2.x) is a requirement, this FreeBSD-provided package 
can be installed in the FreeBSD host machine. 

<https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-5.2> emphasises that 
5.2.x is no longer supported by Oracle.
