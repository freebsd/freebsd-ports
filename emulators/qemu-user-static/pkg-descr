QEMU is a FAST! processor emulator using dynamic translation to achieve
good emulation speed.
QEMU has two operating modes:

    * Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system
(for example a PC), including a processor and various peripherials.
It can be used to launch different Operating Systems without rebooting
the PC or to debug system code.
    * User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can launch
Linux processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU. It can be used to
launch the Wine Windows API emulator or to ease cross-compilation and
cross-debugging.

As QEMU requires no host kernel patches to run, it is very safe and easy to use.

This is a slave port of emulators/qemu-sbruno to build only static
bsd-user targets named like qemu-mips-static.  While still being
experimental people have already built quite a few armv6/mips/mips64
packages using these and e.g. poudriere.  Some notes are also here:
