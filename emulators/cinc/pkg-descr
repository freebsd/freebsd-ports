cinc is a program that emulates the Bell Laboratories cardiac computer
(from here on referred to as cardiac). cardiac stands for cardboard
illustrative aid to computation.

casm is an assembler for the cinc emulator. casm reads a casm source program
and translates it to a cinc loadable program that can be executed with the
cinc emulator.

cinc allows you to run cardiac programs on a real computer.  The real
cardiac allows the student to learn how computers work internally.
