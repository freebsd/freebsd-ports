Sound plugin for Mupen64
Tip: Use mupen64-sdlaudio (JttL's SDL plugin) instead!
-
Mupen64 is a highly portable Nintendo 64 emulator. It has been developed 
on/for Linux originally but has already been ported successfully to other 
operating systems. The program can easily be ported to all operating systems 
supported by the SDL library.

In its current state, the emulator is highly compatible and uses a plugin 
system. With the correct plugins ("correct" can be computer dependent), it 
can achieve nearly perfect graphics and sound in many games.
