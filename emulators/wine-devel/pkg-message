Wine should build on FreeBSD 4.x and FreeBSD 5.x, but versions before
FreeBSD 5.3 will generally not work properly.

Wine requires a configuration file .wine/config in the home directory of
every user, where assignments of Unix directories to DOS drive letters and
other options can be set (see "man wine" for details). You may want to copy
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/wine.conf
and tweak it accordingly or edit this file and make .wine/config a symlink   
there.

The port also installs some of Wine's doc files which describe additional
things that are not in the manual pages, see:
  %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/wine
There are more in the source tree but the others are only useful in
conjunction with the rest of the source tree, and then you can as well
look at them there.  (If you just installed this as a package and do not
know how to use the ports system to have it fetch and extract the source,
have a look at <http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html>.)
