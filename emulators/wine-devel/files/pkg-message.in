Some ZFS tuning guides recommend setting KVA_PAGES=512 in your kernel
configuration.  This is incompatible with Wine.  The maximum possible
is KVA_PAGES=500, which should still be enough for ZFS.

The port also installs some of Wine's documentation which describes
additional programs that are not in the manual pages under
  %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/wine

To enable Wayland run the following two commands:
$ cat > wayland.reg  <<EOF
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\Drivers]
"Graphics"="x11,wayland"
EOF
$ wine64 regedit wayland.reg
EOM
}
