MESS is an acronym that stands for Multi Emulator Super System. MESS will
more or less faithfully reproduce computer and console systems on a PC.
MESS can currently emulate over 250 systems from the last 5 decades.

MESS emulates the hardware of the systems and sometimes utilizes ROM
images to load programs and games. Therefore, these systems are NOT
simulations, but the actual emulations of the hardware.
