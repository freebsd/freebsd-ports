This port installs the Pipelight plugin wrapper for running Silverlight,
Flash and others. Before enabling Pipelight for your users, run the
following as root:

# pipelight-plugin --create-mozilla-plugins

NOTE:

For users running with ZFS on root, watching DRM protected content
requires extensive xattr support. If you run into issues with DRM failing,
you can use the "pipelight-mkufs" command to create a UFS formatted ZVOL
mounted on your users ~/.wine-pipelight directory.

To create the UFS filesystem
# pipelight-mkufs <username>

To remove the UFS filesystem
# pipelight-mkufs --delete <username>
