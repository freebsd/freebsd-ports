A modern open source Game Boy Advance emulator, with support for Game
Boy and Game Boy Color games as well.  The project started in April
2013 with the goal of being fast enough to run on lower end hardware
than other emulators support, without sacrificing accuracy or
portability.  Other goals include accurate enough emulation to provide
a development environment for homebrew software, a good workflow for
tool-assist runners, and a modern feature set for emulators that older
emulators may not support.
