Known issues:
- Videos are garbled since multimedia/ffmpeg update to 3.2, see #9026
- %%DATADIR%%/assets/gamecontrollerdb.txt cannot be used
  as is because SDL_JoystickGetGUID is a stub on FreeBSD. Create the
  file using controllermap (or antimicro) then check with testgamecontroller
  it's detected (pay attention to guid). If you have trouble making it
  work try OLDJOY option for v1.3 behavior.
