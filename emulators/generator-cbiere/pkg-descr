SEGA Genesis emulator

Modified version of Generator by James Ponder based on version 0.35.

Additional features:

* Support for BZIP2, GZIP and ZIP compressed ROMs.
* Support for X11's XVideo hardware acceleration by SDL for faster and
  smoother graphics.
* Fullscreen support with or without the classic color frame.
* SDL audio support (in favour of OSS Audio) which means you can use ESound
  and others for sharing the sound device among other applications.
* Optional mute playing i.e., if you don't have a soundcard or the soundcard
  is busy you can still play.
* Support for 48kHz sample rate (needs driver support).
* Automagic CPU usage reduction which is especially cool for notebooks.
* Working support for Game Genie codes.
