# We need to use ld from ports because the version in base doesn't
# support the '--build-id' switch that's needed for live hypervisor
# hot-patching. Once the ld version in base supports this option the
# dependency can be removed.
#
# GNU objcopy is used instead of elftc objcopy because of bug #533:
# https://sourceforge.net/p/elftoolchain/tickets/533/
# Once this is solved we should be able to switch to elfcopy.
#
# And finally we also need to use nm from binutils because the one
# from base cannot deal with i386pep binary files which is the format
# of the Xen EFI image (note that FreeBSD cannot yet boot as Dom0 from EFI,
# but the image is built anyway). This is reported to elftc as bug #534:
# https://sourceforge.net/p/elftoolchain/tickets/534/
