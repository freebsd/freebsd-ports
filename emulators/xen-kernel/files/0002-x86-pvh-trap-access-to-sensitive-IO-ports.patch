Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86/pvh: trap access to sensitive IO ports
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This is needed so Xen can properly trap 4 byte accesses to 0xcf8 in order to
keep consistency with accesses to 0xcfc.

The access to RTC ports also needs to be trapped in order to keep
consistency, this includes RTC_PORT(0) and RTC_PORT(1) (0x70 and 0x71
respectively).
