Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86/mm: Disable PV linear pagetables by default

Allowing pagetables to point to other pagetables of the same level
(often called 'linear pagetables') has been included in Xen since its
inception.  But it is not used by the most common PV guests (Linux,
NetBSD, minios), and has been the source of a number of subtle
reference-counting bugs.

Add a command-line option to control whether PV linear pagetables are
allowed (disabled by default).

+Allow PV guests to have pagetable entries pointing to other pagetables
+of the same level (i.e., allowing L2 PTEs to point to other L2 pages).
+This technique is often called "linear pagetables", and is sometimes
+used to allow operating systems a simple way to consistently map the
+current process's pagetables into its own virtual address space.
+
+None of the most common PV operating systems (Linux, NetBSD, MiniOS)
+use this technique, but there may be custom operating systems which
+do.
