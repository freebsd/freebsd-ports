RPCS3 is an open-source Sony PlayStation 3 emulator and debugger
written in C++ for Windows and Linux. The project began development on
May 23rd, 2011 and currently sports modern Vulkan, Direct3D 12 and
OpenGL graphic APIs. The emulator is capable of booting and playing
hundreds of commercial games. With each and every contribution and
donation, more and more games are becoming closer and closer to either
booting or full playability.
