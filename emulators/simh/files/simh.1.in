.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a comprehensive suite of simulators for a number of legacy computer systems.
.Pp
Note that there is no actual
.Nm
command; each simulator is invoked with its own command.
Currently, the
available commands are:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Sy altair ,
.Sy altairz80 ,
.Sy gri ,
.Sy h316 ,
.Sy hp2100 ,
.Sy i1401 ,
.Sy i1620 ,
.Sy i7094 ,
.Sy ibm1130 ,
.Sy id16 ,
.Sy id32 ,
.Sy lgp ,
.Sy nova ,
.Sy pdp1 ,
.Sy pdp10 ,
.Sy pdp11 ,
.Sy pdp15 ,
.Sy pdp4 ,
.Sy pdp7 ,
.Sy pdp8 ,
.Sy pdp9 ,
.Sy s3 ,
.Sy sds ,
.Sy simh-eclipse ,
.Sy swtp6800mp-a ,
.Sy swtp6800mp-a2 ,
.Sy vax ,
.Sy vax780 .
.Ed
.Pp
The following options are available for all of the commands:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl e
Processing of
.Ar startup-file
(including nested command invocations) is aborted if
a command error is encountered.
.It Fl q
Certain informational messages are suppressed.
.It Fl v
The commands in
.Ar startup-file
are echoed before they are executed.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar startup-file
is specified, it is used as an initial source of simulator commands.
If
.Ar startup-file
is not specified,
the simulator looks for a startup file consisting of the simulator
name (including its path components) plus the extension
.Pa .ini .
.Pp
If a startup file is specified, either on the
command line or implicitly via the
.Pa .ini
capability, it should contain a series of non-interactive simulator
commands, one per line.
These commands can be used to set up standard parameters, for example disk
sizes.
.Pp
After initializing its internal structures and processing the startup file (if any),
the simulator types out its name and version and then prompts for input with:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Sy sim>
.Ed
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
Documentation is available for each of the simulators. There is
also generic simulator documentation. It can be found locally in
.Pa %%DOCSDIR%%
(if installed), and also at
.Pa http://simh.trailing-edge.com/pdf/all_docs.html .
