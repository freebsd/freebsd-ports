AdvanceMAME and AdvanceMESS are unofficial MAME and MESS versions with
an advanced video support for helping the use with TVs, Arcade Monitors,
Fixed Frequencies Monitors and also for PC Monitors.

They run in GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, DOS, Windows and in all the other
platforms supported by the SDL library.

The main difference compared with the official emulators is that the
Advance versions are able to program directly the video board to always
get a video mode with the correct size and frequency.

Generally the Advance emulators are able to use a video mode which
doesn't require any stretching or other unneeded effects to match the
original arcade display.

The direct video board programming is fully supported in Linux and DOS.
It's partially supported in Windows. It isn't supported in Mac OS X and
other platforms.
