RVVM is a virtual machine / emulator for RISC-V guests, which emphasizes
on performance, security, lean code and portability. It already runs a
lot of guest operating systems, including Linux, Haiku, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, etc. It also aims to run RISC-V applications on a foreign-arch
host without full OS guest & isolation (Userland emulation).
