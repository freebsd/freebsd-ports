libspectrum is a fairly simple library designed to make the handling
of various ZX Spectrum emulator-related file formats easy.
So far it handles:

* Snapshots: .z80, .szx, .sna (all read/write), .zxs, .sp.,
  .snp and +D snapshots (read only)
* Tape images: .tzx, .tap (read/write) and Warajevo .tap (read only)
* Input recordings: .rzx (read/write)
* Timex cartridges: .dck (read only)

There are also some subsidiary functions which may be generally useful
for Spectrum-related utilities.
