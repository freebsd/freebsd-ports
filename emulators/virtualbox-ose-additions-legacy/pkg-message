  message: <<EOM
VirtualBox Guest Additions are installed.

To enable the required services:

# sysrc vboxguest_enable="YES"
# sysrc vboxservice_enable="YES"

To start the services, restart the system.

For features such as window scaling and clipboard sharing, membership of
the wheel group is required. With username jerry as an example:

# pw groupmod wheel -m jerry

The settings dialogue for FreeBSD guests encourages use of the VMSVGA
graphics controller. Whilst this might suit installations of FreeBSD
without a desktop environment (a common use case), it may be inappropriate
where legacy Guest Additions are installed.
