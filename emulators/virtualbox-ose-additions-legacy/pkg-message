VirtualBox Guest Additions were installed.


You need to enable the vboxguest startscript to load the kernel module and
vboxservice to use host time synchronization.

vboxguest_enable="YES"
vboxservice_enable="YES"

You also have to add all X11 users that want to use any of the additional
features (clipboard sharing, window scaling) to the wheel group.

% pw groupmod wheel -m jerry

Reboot the machine to load the needed kernel modules.
