  message: <<EOM
Oracleⓡ VirtualBoxⓡ Guest Additions are installed.

To enable and start the required services: 

# sysrc vboxguest_enable="YES" ; sync ; service vboxguest start
# sysrc vboxservice_enable="YES" ; service vboxservice start

The vboxguest service will load a required kernel module. 

For features such as window scaling and clipboard sharing, membership of 
the wheel group is required. With username jerry as an example: 

# pw groupmod wheel -m jerry

The settings dialogue for FreeBSD guests encourages use of the VMSVGA 
graphics controller. Whilst this might suit installations of FreeBSD 
without a desktop environment (a common use case), it may be inappropriate 
where legacy Guest Additions are installed.
