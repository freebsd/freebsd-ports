VirtualBox Guest Additions provide closer integration between host and 
guest, and improve the performance of guest systems. 

Non-legacy additions i.e. emulators/virtualbox-ose-additions are 
recommended for most use cases. 

Where legacy (5.2.x) is a requirement, this FreeBSD-provided package 
can be installed in the FreeBSD guest machine. 

<https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-5.2> emphasises that 
5.2.x is no longer supported by Oracle.

Addition to host machines is not required.
