SEGA Genesis emulator

Generator is an open source emulator designed to emulate the Sega Genesis /
Mega Drive console, a popular games machine produced in the early 1990s. It is
a portable program written in C and has been ported to the Amiga, Macintosh,
Windows and even pocket PCs such as the iPAQ and Cassiopeia. Natively it
compiles under Unix for X Windows with either tcl/tk or gtk/SDL, for svgalib
and even cross-compiles to DOS with djgpp/allegro.

Generator uses it's own custom 68000 processor emulation which is and uses
compilation techniques such as block-marking, flag calculation removal,
operand pre-calculation, endian pre-conversion etc. There are approximately
1600 C routines generated by the first stage of compilation to cope with the
67 instruction families. These include two versions of every instruction - one
that calculates flags and one that doesn't, so that unnecessary flag
computation is avoided.
