Installation of the Linux base system is
finished. The Linux kernel mode, which
must be enabled for Linux binaries to run,
is now enabled. Linux mode can be enabled
permanently with the linux_enable variable
of rc.conf(5).

To make use of NIS you have to adjust yp.conf and nsswitch.conf in
/compat/linux/etc/ accordingly. For example:

Set your yp-server and yp-domainname in yp.conf:
domainname     my.yp.domainname
ypserver       my.yp.server                                               

Let your lists for hosts, passwd and group be resolved via nsswitch.conf:
passwd:     files nis
shadow:     files nis
group:      files nis
hosts:      files dns nis
