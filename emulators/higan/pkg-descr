higan is a Nintendo multi-system emulator that began development
on 2004-10-14.  The purpose of this emulator is a bit different from
others: it focuses on accuracy, debugging functionality, and clean code.

The emulator does not focus on things that would hinder accuracy.
This includes speed and game-specific hacks for compatibility.
As a result, the minimum system requirements for higan are very high.

The emulator itself was not derived from any existing emulator source code,
such as SNES9x. It was written from scratch.
Any similarities to other emulators are merely coincidental.
