lib765 is an emulation of the uPD765a (AKA Intel 8272) Floppy Disc Controller
[FDC] as used in Amstrad computers such as the PCW, CPC and Spectrum +3. At
present it is not a "full" 765; features not used in the PCW BIOS (such as:
DMA; multisector reads/writes; multitrack mode) are either left unimplemented
or incomplete.

lib765 is released under the GNU Library GPL.
