UAE is a mostly complete software emulation of the hardware of the Commodore
Amiga 500/1000/2000.  Commodore Amiga, for those who don't know, is a 16/32
bit computer system based on the Motorola 680x0 CPU and a few specially
designed custom chips that provide very good graphics and sound capabilities.

Its first incarnation, the A1000, appeared in 1985, followed by the highly
successful A500 and A2000 models.

Requires a valid Amiga ROM file in order to be useful.
