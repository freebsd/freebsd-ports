uCON64 is the video game backup tool and emulator Swiss Army knife program.
It supports almost every system (Consoles, Handheld, and Arcade) with very
verbose ROM information, ROM and SRAM convertion to various backup tool
formats, IPS/APS/BSL/PPF patching, bad dump detection via RomCenter DAT files,
and more.
