===============================================================================
 * The Odyessey2 ROM is included in the source, although the documentation says
   it isn't.
 * The main voice samples are included with this port, but not the sidsamp 
   which are only used by Sid the Spellbinder.  If you need these, put them in
   PREFIX/o2em/voice/.
 * No cartridge ROMS are included.  
 * o2em has been patched to better fit with FreeBSD:
   - don't assume the CWD contains roms/ bios/ voice/
   - don't restrict the location of ROMS to roms/
   - use the correct implementation of gettimeticks() for FreeBSD
   - allow for the use of PREFIX when building
   - don't set the volume to the MAX at runtime
   - be compliant with allegro 4.1.12
