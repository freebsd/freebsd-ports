MAME stands for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator.
When used in conjunction with images of the original
arcade game's ROM and disk data, MAME attempts to
reproduce that game as faithfully as possible on a
more modern general-purpose computer. MAME can currently
emulate several thousand different classic arcade video
games from the late 1970s through the modern era.
