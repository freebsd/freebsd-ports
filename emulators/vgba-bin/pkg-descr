Virtual GameBoy Advance (VGBA) is an emulator of the GameBoy Advance
videogame console produced by Nintendo. It allows to run GameBoy
Advance games on PCs, Macs, or just about any other sufficiently
fast computers in existence. It can also help to debug GameBoy
Advance software without using a costly development system. VGBA
is not a real GameBoy Advance though. Get the real thing if you
want a real experience. Also, VGBA will not play older GameBoy and
GameBoy Color games. You will need VGB for that.
