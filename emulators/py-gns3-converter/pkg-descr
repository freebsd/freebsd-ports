GNS3 Converter is designed to convert old ini-style GNS3 topologies
(<=0.8.7) to the newer version v1+ JSON format for use in GNS3 v1+

The converter will convert all IOS, Cloud and VirtualBox devices
to the new format. It will also convert all QEMU based devices (QEMU
VM, ASA, PIX, JUNOS & IDS). VPCS nodes will be converted to cloud
devices due to lack of information the 0.8.7 topology files.

For topologies containing snapshots, the snapshots will also be
converted to the new format automatically.
