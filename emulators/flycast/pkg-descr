Flycast is a multi-platform Sega Dreamcast, Naomi, Naomi 2, and Atomiswave
emulator derived from the inactive reicast project.

Flycast provides high performance and high compatibility. It supports an HLE
BIOS, so dumping a real BIOS from a console isn't required (but it is still
recommended for increased compatibility). Furthermore it supports widescreen,
either with a generic hack to render outside of the screen, or by auto-applying
codes/patches to certain games which provides better results. Resolution and
texture upscaling is supported alongside dumping and loading of custom textures.
Flycast emulates standard Dreamcast controllers, keyboard, mouse, light-gun
(with your mouse), Twin Sticks, and even the ASCII Mission Stick. It can emulate
two expansion sockets per controller (VMU, Purupuru/Rumble Pack, or Microphone).
Most if not all games compatible with Dreamcast Live servers are supported by
Flycast.
