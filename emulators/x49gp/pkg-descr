An emulator for the HP 49g+/50g calculator series. This is an ARM-based
emulator (unlike emu48 / debug4x), so it is possible to run hpgcc
binaries within the emulator.

Skins for both variants of the calculator are included.

Known limitations:
	- Cannot write to port 2. Libraries will eat up your RAM.
	- HPGCC2/3 SD I/O is unstable.
