  message: <<EOM
Users are encouraged to compile the port on their systems with

    CFLAGS   ?= -O3
    CPUTYPE  ?= native
    WITH_LTO =  yes

This can improve the performance of demanding cores like the N64.

NVIDIA GPU users with versions >= 535 of the x11/nvidia-driver could encounter
crashes or freezes while using the N64 core, see
https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares/issues/1547 and
https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/issues/133. As a workaround either try to
compile the port with the NVIDIA option set, or disable the NVIDIA shader disk
cache at start with

    $ __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE=0 ares

ares uses librashader for its shader support. This library is not available in
the FreeBSD ports tree yet, but it is being worked on, see
https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=280470. In the meantime users
have to compile the library themselves if they want to actually use shaders:

    $ doas pkg install rust-nightly
    $ fetch https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/librashader/archive/refs/tags/librashader-v0.3.0.tar.gz
    $ tar -xf librashader-v0.3.0.tar.gz
    $ cd librashader-librashader-v0.3.0
    $ cargo run -p librashader-build-script -- --profile release
    $ doas cp target/release/librashader.so %%LOCALBASE%%/lib

The port uses the shaders from games/libretro-shaders-slang by default. Users
can curate and utilize their own provided collection of shaders by putting them
into the user data directory

    ${HOME}/.local/share/ares/Shaders/

ares won't process its own installed shaders if it finds any shaders in the user
data directory. Delete or rename the local shaders directory in order to make
ares use its own shaders again.
