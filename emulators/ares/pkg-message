Users are encouraged to compile the port on their systems with an appropriatley
set CPUTYPE in make.conf in order to improve the performance of demanding cores
like the N64. Possible values for CPUTYPE are found in

    /usr/share/examples/etc/make.conf.

The binding space for game inputs and hotkey actions is shared in ares. This can
be an inconvenience for gamepad-only users, who want to assign hotkey actions to
gamepad buttons without enough free unassigned buttons left on the gamepad.
Users can compile the port with the HOTKEYS option enabled in order to mitigate
this problem. This applies an inofficial patch, which locks all hotkey execution
in the unpaused state of the emulator.

The port installs and uses the slang-shaders from games/libretro-shaders-slang
by default. Users can curate and utilize their own provided collection of
shaders by putting them into the user data directory

    ${XDG_DATA_HOME}/ares/Shaders

ares won't process the system-provided shaders if it finds any shaders in the
user data directory. Delete or rename the user data directory in order for ares
to use the system-provided shaders again.
