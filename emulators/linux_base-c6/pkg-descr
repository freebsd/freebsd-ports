This port contains packages from a near-minimal installation of CentOS 6
Linux.  These packages, in conjunction with the Linux kernel module,
form the basis of the Linux compatibility environment. It is designed to
provide a nice user experience by using the FreeBSD configuration for
corresponding Linux stuff where possible. Because of this any work which
needs to chroot into the Linux base may not work as expected (no fallthrough
to the FreeBSD config possible).

This port is only available for the i386/amd64 architecture (i386/32 bit mode).

If you want to run X11 applications, install the x11/linux-xorg-libs port.

For cross-development this port is not suitable, you should use a linux_dist
port instead in this case.
