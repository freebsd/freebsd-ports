Installation of the Linux base system is finished. The Linux kernel
mode, which must be enabled for Linux binaries to run, is now
enabled. Linux mode can be enabled permanently with the linux_enable
variable of rc.conf(5).

----------------------
You should enable Linux mode with the linux_enable variable of rc.conf(5).
Depending on the version of FreeBSD you are using you may have to increase
the emulated linux version via compat.linux.osrelease=2.6.18 in
sysctl.conf(5). Check via "sysctl compat.linux.osrelease" that it shows a
lower version number before setting it.
----------------------

If you want to use shared memory in Linux applications, you need to set up
a link from /dev/shm to a suitable place, e.g. by adding the following line
to /etc/devfs.conf (takes effect on each boot):
	link /tmp shm

To make use of NIS you have to adjust yp.conf and nsswitch.conf in
/compat/linux/etc/ accordingly. For example:

Set your yp-server and yp-domainname in yp.conf:
	domainname	my.yp.domainname
	ypserver	my.yp.server

Let your lists for hosts, passwd and group be resolved via nsswitch.conf:
	passwd:	files nis
	shadow:	files nis
	group:	files nis
	hosts:	files dns nis

WARNING: doing work which needs to chroot into the linux base may not work.
In such cases (e.g. cross-development) you are better suited with a linux_dist
port.
