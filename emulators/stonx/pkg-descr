Release notes for version 0.6.7-epsilon
=======================================

This version is the "almost-there" version of STonX 0.6.7 (which is going
to be the last "release" version before the major changes in the current
development versions are released.

The Xlib-VDI driver is still disabled (sorry) and may or may not be 
re-integrated before the final 0.6.7 release. This depends mostly on
how much work it is to get it to work again after all the latest changes.

Please notify me of any bugs or installation problems as soon as possible
(mail me at nino@complang.tuwien.ac.at), even if you have reported a bug
previously and I haven't had time or forgot to fix it.
