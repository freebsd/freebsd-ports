DuckStation is a PlayStation 1, aka. PSX Emulator.

DuckStation is an simulator/emulator of the Sony PlayStation(TM) console,
focusing on playability, speed, and long-term maintainability. The goal is to
be as accurate as possible while maintaining performance suitable for low-end
devices.

That version of DuckStation includes local (FreeBSD-only) patches, mostly used
to fix build and relocate resources to common paths.
