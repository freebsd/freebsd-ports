===============================================================================
To do anything useful with the emulator, you need:

  - a GPU (graphical processing unit) plugin, choose between:

      emulators/linux-peops-softgpu
      emulators/linux-pete-xgl2gpu
      emulators/linux-pete-mesagpu

  - a SPU (sound processing unit) plugin:

      emulators/linux-peops-spu

  - optionally, a joystick plugin:

      emulators/linux-padjoy

  - a Playstation BIOS image:

      The port documentation says: "during testing we found out that the
      scph1001.bin and scph7502.bin BIOS are compatible, but the scph1000.bin
      won't work".

      Please keep in mind that the Playstation BIOS is copyrighted software.

Moreover, some users report that the emulator does not work for them unless
they mount the Linux process file system. To mount linprocfs, add the
following line to /etc/fstab:

linproc		/compat/linux/proc	linprocfs	rw	0	0

and reboot the system.
