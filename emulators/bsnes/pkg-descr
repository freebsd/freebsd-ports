bsnes is an emulator that began development on 2004-10-14.
The purpose of this emulator is a bit different from others:
it focuses on accuracy, debugging functionality, and clean code.

The emulator does not focus on things that would hinder accuracy.
This includes speed and game-specific hacks for compatibility.
As a result, the minimum system requirements for bsnes are very high.

The emulator itself was not derived from any existing emulator source code,
such as SNES9x. It was written from scratch by myself.
Any similarities to other emulators are merely coincidental.
