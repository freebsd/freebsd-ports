aftp manipulates and browses Apple II disk images.  It
supports both Apple II DOS 3.3,  ProDOS  and  XGS  images.
Both  binary  floppy  images  (.IIE)  and hard disk volume
(.HDV) images are also supported. It does NOT support the
new 2mg format.

This version contains my patches and man page but nothing significant
has changed since Andru Luvisi released it at the end of 1996.

Share and enjoy,
