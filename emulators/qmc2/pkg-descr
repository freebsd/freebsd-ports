M.A.M.E./M.E.S.S. Catalog / Launcher II - also referred to as QMC2 - is
the successor of one of the first UNIX MAME GUI front ends available on
this planet called QMamecat (derived from MAMECAT, which was text-only).

QMamecat was based upon Qt 2; its development was frozen in 2003. QMC2
has been rebuilt from scratch as a Qt 4 project. Parts of the design and
code were inspired by its predecessor, but it's not just a remake. We
tried to make the new design as flexible as possible to minimize
dependencies from front end and CLI related MAME changes, which was a
major deficiency of QMamecat. QMC2 now uses a template based emulator
configuration scheme, which can easily be enhanced with additional
command line options (defined in an XML template file).

As a result of this flexible design, QMC2 can be used for multiple
emulators. Currently we support SDLMAME & SDLMESS on UNIX and Mac, and
the original variants of MAME & MESS on Windows.
