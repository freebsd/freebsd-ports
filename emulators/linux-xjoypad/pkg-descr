excerpt from README.txt:

xjoypad allows an USB joypad (probably a USB joystick, too) to be used
with games on linux (probably other unix-like operating systems too).
This is done by mapping the joypad events to X keyboard events which
are sent to the window currently having the focus. Therefore only
keyboard-controlled games are currently supported by xjoypad. xjoypad
was written to add joypad support to the playstation emulator epsxe.

This is the Linux version.
