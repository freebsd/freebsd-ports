Mini vMac is a minor spin off of the program vMac. Its goal is to
provide the simplest usable emulation of a Macintosh, instead of
the fastest or most usable emulation. It can serve as a programmers
introduction to vMac, having only about one tenth as much source
code.

Mini vMac, like vMac, emulates an Apple Macintosh Plus(tm).
