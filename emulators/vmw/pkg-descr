VMware Command Line Tools

On this page, you'll find command line programs which can replace and/or
supplement the VMware's official VMwareTools.

These programs use VMware's undocumented and therefore not officially
supported feature to communicate with VMware (see VMware Backdoor I/O Port).
Information on these functions have come entirely from my personal research
and quite a few contributions by fellow VMware users.

These programs are intended partly as illustrative examples of how to use the
VMware backdoor function and I have cut many corners writing them.

* vmw: generic backdoor access program
* vmshrink: virtual disk shrink program
* vmftp: host-guest file transfer program
