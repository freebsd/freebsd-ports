GXemul is a free instruction-level machine emulator, emulating not only the
CPU, but also other hardware components, making it possible to use the emulator
to run unmodified operating systems such as NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Linux.

A few different machine types are emulated. The following machine types are
emulated well enough to run at least one "guest OS":

 * ARM: CATS (NetBSD/cats, OpenBSD/cats), IQ80321 (NetBSD/evbarm), NetWinder
   (NetBSD/netwinder)
 * MIPS: DECstation 5000/200 (NetBSD/pmax, OpenBSD/pmax, Ultrix,
   Linux/DECstation, Sprite), Acer Pica-61 (NetBSD/arc), NEC MobilePro 770,
   780, 800, 880 (NetBSD/hpcmips), Cobalt (NetBSD/cobalt), Malta
   (NetBSD/evbmips, Linux/Malta) Algorithmics P5064 (NetBSD/algor), SGI
   O2 (aka IP32) (NetBSD/sgi)
 * PowerPC: IBM 6050/6070 (PReP, PowerPC Reference Platform) (NetBSD/prep),
   MacPPC (generic "G4" Macintosh) (NetBSD/macppc)
 * SuperH: Sega Dreamcast (NetBSD/dreamcast, Linux/dreamcast),
   Landisk (OpenBSD/landisk)
