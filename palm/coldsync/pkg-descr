	ColdSync is a robust, extensible, portable tool for
synchronizing PalmOS devices (PalmPilot et al.) with a Unix
workstation. It also supports USB connections, under FreeBSD 4.0
and higher.
	It runs without a GUI, and therefore allows you to sync
without running X.
	ColdSync is extensible through the use of conduits, which
allow it to share information with other applications.
