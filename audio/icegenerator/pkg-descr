IceGenerator is a direct streaming generator for Icecast/Shoutcast. It runs
as a daemon.Three child processes handle all the stuff. A fourth (optional)
child cares about telnet communication. Main idea for this program is radio
automation on a Icecast/Shoutcast server. If you have many server processes and
CPU saving is your priority, u can use IceGenerator. Obviously mp3s/oggs will
be already resampled to allow their streaming on your bandwidth capability.
