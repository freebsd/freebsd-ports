Cyclone is a library of PureData classes, bringing some level of
compatibility between Max/MSP and Pd environments. The original
goal of cyclone was to create a collection of Max/MSP objects for
PureData. This was in the 2000s area, Max/MSP version 4.6. Since
then MAX evolved its architecture and file format to something that
is incompatible with PureData. Compatibility in patch file level
is limited to this very old version of Max/MSP.
