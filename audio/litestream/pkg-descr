Litestream is an Open Source, infinitely scalable high-capacity MP3
streaming system for Unix. Tests on Pentium II 400 single processor
demonstrated the system is capable of at at least 4000 simultaneous 56 Kbit
streams. That's 244 Mbit per node!

The Litestream system is a series of components which are compatible with
today's industry standards (Winamp, XMMS, Live365). Included in the
distribution is Streaming Server, Streaming Source, and Restreaming
Server. Each component is replaceable with the third-party component of
your choice. Streaming Source be replaced with Winamp DSP. Streaming Server
can be replaced with Shoutcast or Live365. Restreaming Server restreams
Shoutcast and Live365 streams. It's all plug-and-play.
