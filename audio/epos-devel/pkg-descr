Epos is a language independent rule-driven Text-to-Speech (TTS) system
primarily designed to serve as a research tool.  Epos is (or tries to be)
independent of the language processed, linguistic description method, and
computing environment.  It has the following features:

  - Czech and Slovak text to speech synthesis configuration
  - LPC and time domain speech synthesizers
  - Prosody modelling driven by rules, prosody models, and artificial
    neural networks
  - All language dependencies are defined in the configuration files,
    as opposed to the source code
  - Documentation in English included in the distribution

This is a port for the development version of Epos.
