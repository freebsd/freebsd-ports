The G.722 module is a bit exact implementation of the ITU G.722 specification
for all three specified bit rates - 64000bps, 56000bps and 48000bps. It passes
the ITU tests.

To allow fast and flexible interworking with narrow band telephony, the encoder
and decoder support an option for the linear audio to be an 8k samples/second
stream. In this mode the codec is considerably faster, and still fully
compatible with wideband terminals using G.722.
