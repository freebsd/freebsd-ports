Ezstream is a command line source client for Icecast media streaming servers.
It began as the successor of the old "shout" utility, and has since gained a
lot of useful features.

In its basic mode of operation, it streams media files or data from standard
input without reencoding and thus requires only very little CPU resources.
It can also use various external decoders and encoders to reencode from one
format to another, and stream the result to an Icecast server. Additional
features include scriptable playlist and metadata handling. All of its
features make ezstream a very flexible source client.

Supported media formats for streaming are MP3, Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora.
Native metadata support includes MP3 (ID3v1 only) and Ogg Vorbis, and many
more formats when the optional TagLib support has been compiled in.
