xwave - an audio player, recorder, editor  for the XWindow System

Note from the original author:

The user interface of xwave is based on Athena and FWF widgets.
The application defaults are optimized for Xaw3d, so if you don't
use Xaw3d you may want to modify the resources.

Features:
	- multiple files
	- overview window
	- zoom window
	- mark, cut, copy, paste, merge
	- echo, reverse, swap, resample, volume (absolute, dynamic
	  compressor)

	  implementations)
