CAVA (Cross-platform Audio Visualizer) is a bar spectrum audio visualizer for
the terminal (ncurses) or desktop (SDL). It also provides a GLSL shader output
backend which can enhance the desktop experience even more. The supported input
backends include OSS, sndio, JACK, portaudio, pulseaudio and fifo.

This program is not intended for scientific use. It's written to look
responsive and aesthetic when used to visualize music.
