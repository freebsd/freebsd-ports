If you want to visualize your currently played back audio then be aware that the
audio backends OSS and sndio can't feed the outgoing audio directly into CAVA
without further setup:

* For OSS you need to use audio/virtual_oss in order to create a loopback
  audio device.
* For sndio you need to start a sndio server and create a monitoring
  sub-device.

Please see %%DOCSDIR%%/README.md for additional help and instructions.
