playmidi is a small, quick midi file player using the level two sequencer
of the voxware 3.0 package to play on general midi devices or FM or
Gravis Ultrasound.  If no files are specified, playmidi will give a short
summary of usage options. If more than one file is specified, you may
skip to the next file while the current one is playing by pressing your
interrupt (usually control-c) key. If you invoke playmidi while it is al-
ready running, it will allow you to control the currently running invoca-
tion until its death, after which time all waiting invocations fight to
go first.
