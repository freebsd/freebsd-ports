Grip is a front-end to external cd audio rippers (such as dagrab or
cdda2wav). It also provides an automated frontend for MP3 encoders, letting
you take a disc and transform it easily straight into MP3s. The CDDB
protocol is supported for retrieving track information from disc database
servers. Grip works with DigitalDJ to provide a unified "computerized"
version of your music collection.
