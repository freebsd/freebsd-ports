This module returns a hash containing basic information about a FLAC file,
a representation of the embedded cue sheet if one exists, as well as tag
information contained in the FLAC file's Vorbis tags. There is no complete
list of tag keys for Vorbis tags, as they can be defined by the user; the
basic set of tags used for FLAC files include:

* ALBUM
* ARTIST
* TITLE
* DATE
* GENRE
* TRACKNUMBER
* COMMENT
