Test::Corpus::Audio::MPD will try to launch a new mpd server for
testing purposes. This mpd server will then be used during
POE::Component::Client::MPD or Audio::MPD tests.

In order to achieve this, the module will create a fake mpd.conf
file with the correct pathes (ie, where you untarred the modulE
tarball). It will then check if some mpd server is already running,
and stop it if the MPD_TEST_OVERRIDE environment variable is true
(die otherwise). Last it will run the test mpd with its newly
created configuration file.
