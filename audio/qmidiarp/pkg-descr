QMidiArp is an advanced MIDI arpeggiator, programmable step sequencer and LFO.
It can hold any number of arpeggiator, sequencer, or LFO modules running in
parallel.

Arpeggiator modules produce sequences depending on the notes sent to their input
port, which is typically connected to a keyboard or another sequencer.

Step sequencer modules allow you to create simple linear, monophonic and
globally transposable sequences similar to the first analog sequencers.

MIDI LFO modules independently produce MIDI controller data of adjustable
waveform, time resolution, amplitude and duration.

A Global Storage Tool can store different setups and switch between them at a
given time. It allows you to dynamically combine patterns and LFO wave forms.
