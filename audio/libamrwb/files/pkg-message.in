AMR codecs incorporate several patents, held by Ericsson,
Universite de Sherbrooke (VoiceAge) and Nokia.
VoiceAge claims to provide patent portfolio for AMR codecs. Depending on law in
your country, manufacturers and developers may need to get a license.
Because it is a shared library, you may need a special contract for each one
application, which links against this library, directly or indirectly.
