This is a command-line utility which tries to determine the encoder used to
create an mp3 file.

Each encoder has unique characteristics fingerprinted into each file. This
program analyzes algorithms that are used in any given file and determines which
encoder was used. For example the Xing encoder never uses short blocks.
