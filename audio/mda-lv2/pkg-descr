MDA-LV2 is an LV2 port of the MDA plugins by Paul Kellett. It contains
36 high-quality plugins for a variety of tasks.

This is a more or less faithful port of both the effects and instrument
plugins. The only functional difference in code is to support LV2-style
toggle ports (> 0.0 is on, rather than 0.5). All the plugins have been
tested, and thanks to several bug fixes this collection should be more
reliable than the original.
