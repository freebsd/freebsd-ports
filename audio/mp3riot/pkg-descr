mp3riot (formerly known as f2html.pl) is a command line utility
that searches recursively through directories, builds a file list
(with additional file information), and generates HTML files,
playlists, etc. The output can be controlled, links can be corrected,
and more. The script is mainly designed to create Web pages,
playlists, and databases for MP3 and Ogg files, but can also used for
other purposes.
