A customisable music player inspired by foobar2000. It offers a growing list
of widgets to manage and play your local music collection. It's extensible
using a plugin system and many widgets make use of FooScript to offer an even
deeper level of control. A layout editing mode enables the entire user
interface to be customised, starting from a blank slate or a preset layout.
