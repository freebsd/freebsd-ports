Jack-smf-utils is a set of two utilities - jack-smf-player and
jack-smf-recorder - whose purpose is to play and record MIDI streams
from/to Standard MIDI Files (i.e. the files with .mid extension)
using JACK MIDI.  There is also smfsh, "SMF shell" that is kind of
interactive, command line SMF files manipulation tool which started
its life as a debugging aid.  And finally libsmf, C library for
loading, writing and manipulating the contents of SMF files.
