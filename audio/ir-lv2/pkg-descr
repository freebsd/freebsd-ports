LV2 Impulse response (convolution) plugin (for reverb and cabinet simulation).
This fork adds LV2 State extenstion support for proper storing of internal
plugin data.

IR is a no-latency/low-latency, realtime, high performance signal
convolver especially for creating reverb effects. Supports impulse
responses with 1, 2 or 4 channels, in any soundfile format supported
by libsndfile.
