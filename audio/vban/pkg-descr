This project an open-source implementation of VBAN protocol.  VBAN is a
simple audio over UDP protocol proposed by VB-Audio.  It is composed of
several command-line tools allowing to stream audio coming from audio
backend interfaces to VBAN stream (vban_emitter) or play incoming VBAN
stream to audio backend interfaces (vban_receptor), or send text over
the VBAN protocol (vban_sendtext).

ALSA, Jack, and PulseAudio audio backends have been implemented.  FIFO
(pipe) output is also available, to allow chaining command-line tools,
and a file output too (for writing raw PCM data).
