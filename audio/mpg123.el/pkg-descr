The mpg123.el Emacs-Lisp program is a front-end to mpg123/ogg123 audio player.
You can select and play an mp3 file from the list in your Emacs's buffer with
familiar interface.

Because mpg123.el is an Emacs-Lisp program and is written carefully to
preserve portability, it must run on almost all variant of Emacs, especially
recent one. Here is the list of environment where mpg123.el is reported to be
available. If you find mpg123 running on other platforms than below, please
tell me your environment.
