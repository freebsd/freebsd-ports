Sphinx 2 is a large-vocabulary, speaker-independent, continuous
speech recognition engine.

This is an early release of a research system.  The APIs and function
names are likely to change, and several tools still need to be made
available to make this all complete.

Once the system is built, try running the Perl script sphinx2-demo.
The sphinx2-test script should run sphinx2-batch over an example
utterance of "go forward ten meters."
