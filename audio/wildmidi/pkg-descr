WildMIDI is a simple software midi player which has a core softsynth library
that can be used with other applications.

The WildMIDI library uses Gravis Ultrasound patch files to convert MIDI files
into audio which is them passed back to the calling application for further
processing or output. The API of the library is designed so that it is easy to
include WildMIDI into applications that wish to include MIDI file playback.
With multiple MIDI file support you can develop applications to mix several
midi files together at the same time and with the next release you will be
able to use a different patch set for each MIDI file.

The wildmidi player is a demonstration program to show the capabilities of
libWildMidi.
