XAnalyser is a program to analyse a stereo audio signal. It has two displays:

Frequency Spectrum
Using Fast Fourier Transform, the time domain of the signal is transformed into
the frequency domain, i.e. the amplitude (in logarithmic scale) of the
audio signal is plotted versus the frequency. Either the sum of the
left and right channel of the audio signal can be shown or both
channels simultaneously.

XY Scope
Roughly speaking, the audio signal of left channel deflects a point
horizontally and the right channel vertically (just as the beam of a CRT
would do). Thus, an audio signal only present on the left channel produces
a horizontal line, whereas an audio signal only present on the right channel
produces a vertical line. A mono signal produces a 45 degree line.
A stereo signal creates a wilde pattern (if the phase is correct,
predominately in the same direction as a mono signal) or may even fill
the entire scope.
