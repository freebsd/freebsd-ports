This plugin aims to implement the MPRIS protocol for DeaDBeeF music player.

The original MPRIS plugin for DeaDBeeF does not work anymore and seems to be
orphaned.  The original plugin supported MPRISv1 and MPRISv2.  This plugin
only supports version two.

What is currently missing:

  - The whole optional "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.TrackList" interface
  - The whole optional "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Playlists" interface
  - The optional "Fullscreen" property of the org.mpris.MediaPlayer2
    interface
  - The optional "CanSetFullscreen" property of the org.mpris.MediaPlayer2
    interface
