XymMS is an XMMS input plugin capable of playing Sega Genesis GYM files by
rendering FM, DAC, and PSG signals through emulation of the YM2612 and SN76496
sound chips found in the video game console. It supports zlib compression and
decompression, and other various settings for output quality, etc. You can
compress and decompress files along with updating ID tags using the File Info
window.
