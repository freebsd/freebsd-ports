libgpod is a shared library to access the contents of an iPod.  This library
is based on code used in the gtkpod project.  Starting with V0.96.CVS gtkpod
depends on this library.

This code was originally part of gtkpod itself.  When the parsing code was
made self-contained with gtkpod V0.93, decision was made to put this code in
a separate library so that other projects can benefit from it without
duplicating code.

libgpod supports playlists, smart playlists, playcounts, ratings, podcasts,
cover art, audio and video.  Photo support is implemented as well.  Python
and Mono bindings are optionally available too.
