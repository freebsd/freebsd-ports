LINGOT is a musical instrument tuner. It's accurate, easy to use, and highly
configurable. Originally conceived to tune electric guitars, it can now be
used to tune other instruments.

It looks like an analogue tuner, with a gauge indicating the relative
shift to a certain note, found automatically as the closest note
to the estimated frequency.
