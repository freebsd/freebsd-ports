GOGO-no-coda-petit is new variant of well-known GOGO-no-coda
mp3 encoder optimized with MMX, 3DNow!, Enhanced 3DNow! and SSE

*** DO NOT OVERCLOCK YOUR CPUs ***
GOGO heavily uses the part of processors that almost sleeps in usual,
so makes them very hot even it runs standard clock.
Overclocking may cause serious internal errors and crazy results.
Or you need gigantic heatsink and extra-noisy fans. :-)
