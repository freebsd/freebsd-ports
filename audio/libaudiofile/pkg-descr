This Audio File Library is an implementation of the SGI Audio File
library.  Since the latter is specified ambiguously in places, I've
taken some liberties in interpreting certain such ambiguities.  At the
present, not all features of the SGI Audio File library are
implemented.  I feel, though, that this implementation of the Audio
File Library offers enough functionality to be useful for general
tasks.

This library allows the processing of audio data to and from audio files.
