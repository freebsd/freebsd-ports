Gigedit is a graphical instrument editor for sample based virtual instruments,
based on the GigaStudio/Gigasampler file format. The GigaStudio/Gigasampler
(.gig) file format is one of the major sampler formats supported by LinuxSampler
and hence you can use Gigedit both as stand-alone instrument editor, or in
conjunction with LinuxSampler for editing such instruments "live" while playing
them with the sampler.
