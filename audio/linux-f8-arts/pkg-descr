Red Hat Linux 8.0 shipping version of the arts library.

The principle of arts is to create/process sound using small modules which do
certain tasks. These may be create a waveform (oscillators), play samples,
filter data, add signals, perform effects like delay/flanger/chorus, or
output the data to the soundcard.

By connecting all those small modules together, you can perform complex
tasks like simulating a mixer, generating an instrument or things like
playing a wave file with some effects.
