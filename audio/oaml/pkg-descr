OAML is a library the makes it easy to implement adaptive music in
games.

Adaptive music, also known as interactive music or dynamic music,
is music that reacts to what's happening on the video game. For
example, if there is a battle going on, music will get more tense
to stimulate the player's reaction to the battle.
