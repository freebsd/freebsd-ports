Icecast-kh is a fork of icecast, a streaming mp3/ogg-vorbis audio server.

Icecast provides nearly all the functionality of the Shoutcast server.
It will accept encoding streams from encoders like winamp, shout and ices.
It can also add itself to a directory server such as our own
icecast.linuxpower.org or Nullsoft's yp.shoutcast.com.
