note from the NetBSD maintainer:

This voice uses a very small and efficient pulse-excited LPC diphone
synthesis method.  It was originally written by Steve Isard.  The
front end uses the same British English lexicon, intonation and
duration methods as rab_diphone.

This voice can be activated via (voice_don_diphone).
