Xcd is a simple GUI to control a CD player. It requires Tcl/Tk to be
installed on your system.
Xcd has the usual buttons to control a CD player: "play",
"pause/resume", "stop", "eject", "next track", "previous track",
"rewind", "forward" and a volume slider. Xcd displays continuously the
current track number and the elapsed time of the track. Pressing the
left mouse button on the "track" label causes Xcd to display the total
number of the tracks and the total duration of the disk. Pressing the
left mouse button on the "time" label causes xcd to display the
duration of the current track. Pressing the middle mouse button on
the "track" button allows to choose a track number to play.
