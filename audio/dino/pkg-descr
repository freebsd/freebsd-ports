Dino is a pattern-based MIDI sequencer, which means that you write
small patterns of MIDI events that you can repeat and arrange to
create a whole song.  Each track has its own patterns, so you can
for example play the same drum pattern over and over again while
you play different lead synth patterns and basslines.
