ripit can use a number of different programs to do the actual track
extraction and audio encoding. By default ripit uses cdparanoia and
lame respectively, so this port depends on those two having been
installed. If you want ripit to use other helper utils, just install
them and tell ripit which ones to use.

It is recommended that you set your CD-device, the preferred ripper
and encoder, any encoding quality preferences etc. on the ripit
command line and adding "--save" to get those as the default values.
This will enable you to later on just type "ripit" and start doing
your work.

For more help, type "ripit --help"
