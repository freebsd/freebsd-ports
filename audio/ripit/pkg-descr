RipIT is used to create MPEG-1 Layer 3 (mp3) using Lame, or uses Flac (flac),
Ogg Vorbis (ogg) or Faac (m4a) to convert audio files (wav) extracted from an
audio CD. It is a console based front-end (no GUI here), written in Perl, for
various programs.

The program will do the following without user intervention:
 * getting the audio CD Album/Artist/Tracks information from CDDB
 * ripping the audio CD Tracks
 * encoding to Flac, mp3 or Ogg
 * id3 tags encoded songs
 * creating an playlist (m3u) file
 * optionally generating a toc (cue) sheet for nice DAO burning
 * optionally preparing and send a CDDB submission and save it locally
 * optionally extracting hidden songs and split ghost songs
 * optionally creating md5sum files for all tracks
 * running several encoder processes at the same time and same run
