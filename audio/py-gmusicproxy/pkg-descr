This program permits the use of Google Play Music with All Access
subscription with any music player that is able to stream MP3 files and to
manage M3U playlists (e.g., MPD server, VLC, ...). It can work also with a
free account without All Access extras.

This project is based on the great Unofficial Google Play Music API
(gmusicapi) of Simon Weber: it already permits to create URLs to stream the
tracks as regular MP3 but they expire in 1 minute! Keeping this proxy
running, it can generate persistent local URLs that never expire and that
can be used in any media-player.

This project is not supported nor endorsed by Google. Its aim is not the
abuse of the service but the one to improve the access to it. I'm not
responsible of its misuse.
