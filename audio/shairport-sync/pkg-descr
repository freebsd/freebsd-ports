Shairport Sync is an AirPlay audio player - it plays audio streamed from iTunes,
iOS devices and other AirPlay sources such as Quicktime Player and ForkedDaapd,
among others. Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised
with the source and hence with similar devices playing the same source. In this
way, synchronised multi-room audio is possible without difficulty.
