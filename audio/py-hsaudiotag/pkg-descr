hsaudiotag is a pure Python library that lets you read metadata (bitrate,
sample rate, duration and tags) from mp3, mp4, wma, ogg, flac and aiff files.
It can only read tags, not write to them, but unlike more complete libraries
(like Mutagen), it is BSD licensed, making it suitable for most projects.
It is also backed by a nifty test suite.
