The CLUNK C++ library provides support for real-time 3D sound
generation. It puts virtually no limitations on the developer;
people who is experienced on working with other solutions (such as
SDL_Mixer or Creative OpenAL) will respect this advantage.

The library supports mixing of any number of sound channels and any
number of objects that have sounds connected to them. The SDL library
is used for sound output. The project is currently at beta testing
stage, preparing to the first release.
