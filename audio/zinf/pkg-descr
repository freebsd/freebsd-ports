The Zinf audio player is a simple, but powerful audio player for Linux and
Win32. It supports MP3, Ogg/Vorbis, WAV and Audio CD playback, with a powerful
music browser, theme support and a download manager. 

It is based on the FreeA*p audio player which was developed by EMusic. The
FreeA*p project was discontinued due to a trademark conflict and EMusic being
acquired by Vivendi.
