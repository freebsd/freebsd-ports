LADI Session Handler or simply ladish is a session management system for JACK
applications on GNU/Linux. Its aim is to allow you to have many different audio
programs running at once, to save their setup, close them down and then easily
reload the setup at some other time. ladish doesn't deal with any kind of audio
or MIDI data itself; it just runs programs, deals with saving/loading
(arbitrary) data and connects JACK ports together.
