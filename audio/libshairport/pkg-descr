libshairport
============
Created by Team XBMC

This is a fork of ShairPort written by James Laird <jhl@mafipulation.org>. The
XBMC team decided to fork ShairPort and make it into a library.

What it is
----------
This program emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose of streaming music from
iTunes and compatible iPods. It implements a server for the Apple RAOP protocol.
ShairPort does not support AirPlay v2 (video and photo streaming).

It supports multiple simultaneous streams, if your audio output chain (as
detected by libao) does so.
