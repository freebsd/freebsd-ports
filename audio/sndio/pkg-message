Sndio's OSS support (i.e. local playback/recording support) is highly
experimental.  If you run into problems please file a bug at
https://github.com/t6/sndio or send an email to t+sndio@tobik.me.

Enable the sndiod server with:

    sysrc sndiod_enable=YES
    service sndiod start

Please note that by default sndiod is configured with a monitoring
sub-device i.e. a device through which you can record everything that
plays through sndiod:

    aucat -f snd/0.monitor -o recording.wav

Make sure you override sndiod_flags if this is not wanted:

    sysrc sndiod_flags=""

If you want clients to auto-play to your remote sndio server set
sndiod_flags accordingly:

    sysrc sndiod_flags="-f snd@remotehost/0"

Alternatively you can always set the AUDIODEVICE environment variable
so clients know where to stream to:

    export AUDIODEVICE=snd@remotehost/0

There is little sndio support in the FreeBSD ports tree right now.  If
your favourite port is missing support please take a look at the fork
at https://github.com/t6/freebsd-ports-sndio and
https://github.com/t6/freebsd-ports-sndio/wiki/Status which contains
patches that enable sndio support in various ports.

audio/pulseaudio-module-sndio is a PulseAudio module that allows you
to play to your sndio server.  This is useful for ports that have
PulseAudio support but no direct sndio support.
