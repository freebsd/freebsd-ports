sndio's OSS support (i.e. local playback support) is highly
experimental.  If you run into problems please file a bug at
https://github.com/t6/sndio or send an email to t+sndio@tobik.me.

The recommended way to use this port is to have a remote sndio server
running on a Linux or OpenBSD host.

If you want clients to auto-play to your remote sndio server, enable
sndiod with:

    sysrc sndiod_enable=YES sndiod_flags="-f snd@remotehost/0"
    service sndiod start

For local playback simply enabling the sndiod server will suffice

    sysrc sndiod_enable=YES

Alternatively set the AUDIODEVICE environment variable so clients know
where to stream to

    export AUDIODEVICE=snd@remotehost/0

There is no sndio support in the official FreeBSD ports tree yet.  The
fork at https://github.com/t6/freebsd-port-sndio contains patches that
enable sndio support in important ports.

audio/pulseaudio-module-sndio is a PulseAudio module that allows you
to play to your sndio server.  This is useful for ports that have
PulseAudio support but no direct sndio support.
