TonieToolbox allows you to create custom audio content for Tonie boxes by
converting various audio formats into the specific file format required by
Tonie devices.

The tool provides several capabilities:

- Convert single or multiple audio files into a Tonie-compatible format
- Process complex folder structures recursively to handle entire audio collections
- Analyze and validate existing Tonie files
- Split Tonie files into individual opus tracks
- Compare two TAF files for debugging differences
- Support various input formats through FFmpeg conversion
- Extract and use audio media tags (ID3, Vorbis Comments, etc.) for better file naming
- Upload Tonie files directly to a TeddyCloud server
- Automatically upload cover artwork alongside Tonie files
