You installed INScore, the environment for the design of interactive
augmented music scores.

INScore works based on OSC (Open Sound Control) signals in the form of
network packets (by default on the port 7000), or in the form of
.inscore programs.

INScore understands .inscore syntax, which is OSC format amended with
commands for general purpose programming, which makes it a programming
language.

OSC signals are expected to be sent through the network by some of
numerous programs supporting this standard.

The main executable, inscoreviewer, opens the window, listens to the
port 7000, and also expects .inscore files to be dropped into its
window.

Please use .inscore files in examples to see what INScore can do.
