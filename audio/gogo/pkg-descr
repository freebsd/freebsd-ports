GOGO-no-coda is very fast MP3 encoder based on lame-3.29beta,
optimized with MMX, 3DNow!, Enhanced 3DNow! and SSE (patched nasm required
to compile with E3DNow! and kernel support needed to enable SSE but FreeBSD
does not have it yet).

*** DO NOT OVERCLOCK YOUR CPUs ***
GOGO heavily uses the part of processors that almost sleeps in usual,
so makes them very hot even it runs standard clock.
Overclocking may cause serious internal errors and crazy results.
Or you need gigantic heatsink and extra-noisy fans. :-)
