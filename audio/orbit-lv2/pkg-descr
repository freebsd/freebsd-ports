Several LV2 plugin bundled together:
* Beatbox
  Creates MIDI events based on LV2 time position events, e.g. to drive a
  drum machine. Bars and beats can be disabled/enabled separately.
* Cargoship
  Record/Playback of arbitrary LV2 atoms to/from disk. Record all incoming atom
  messages with sample accuracy and play them back later from disk. Stored atom
  event data is part of the plugin state and is preserved across instantiations.
* Click
  Synthesizes click tracks based on LV2 time position events (bars and beats).
  Bars and beats can be disabled/enabled separately.
* Looper
  Loops arbitrary LV2 atom events on a ping-pong buffer. E.g. loops MIDI, OSC
  or anything else that can be packed into LV2 atoms with sample accuracy.
  Needs to be driven by LV2 time position events.
* Pacemaker
  Creates LV2 time position events from scratch to drive other plugins.
* Quantum
  Quantizes incoming events to whole beats.
* Subspace
  Subdivide or multiply incoming time signals by whole fractions, e.g. to speed
  up time x2, x3, ... or slow it down to x1/2, x1/3, ...
