The Portable C Audio Library (pcaudiolib) provides a C API to different
audio devices. Supported backends are ALSA, OSS, and PulseAudio.

This Port can be built with any combination of the supported backends,
but official packages are distributed with OSS support only, in order
to not depend on the other backends being installed.
