rplay is a flexible network audio system that allows sounds to be played to
and from local and remote systems.  The rplay audio server currently
supports SunOS 4.1.X, Solaris 2.X, Linux, SGI IRIX 4 & 5, HP9000/705,
HP9000/710 and now FreeBSD.  The rplay clients and client library should
work on any system that supports Berkeley sockets.  The X Window
System is not required.
