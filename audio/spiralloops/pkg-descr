   SpiralLoops is an experimental loop-based sampler for Linux or
   FreeBSD.

   The idea of SpiralLoops is to provide a simple, visual tool for
   looping and layering of sounds; which can be sourced from either wav
   files on disk, or from sound-generating plugins.

   SpiralLoops allows you to create loop based compositions with the
   minimum feedback time between the decisions you make and your ears.
   The looping mechanism is very flexible, you can lock the timing of
   loops together, or offset them for creating complex sequences, such as
   polyrhythms.

Instructions for using the program are on its home page.
