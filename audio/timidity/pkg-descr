TiMidity is a software synthesizer. It can play MIDI files by converting them
into PCM waveform data; give it a MIDI data along with digital instrument data
files, then it synthesizes them in real-time, and plays. It can not only play
sounds, but also can save the generated waveforms into hard disks as various
audio file formats.

TiMidity 0.2i was written by Tuukka Toivonen <tt@cgs.fi> in 1995. No new version
of this project has been released since then. Development has been continued by
Masanao Izumo et al. in the new project named TiMidity++ (audio/timidity++).
