LASH is a session management system for JACK audio applications.
It is an implementation of a proposal that originated from this
discussion.  Its aim is to allow you to have many different audio
programs running at once, to save their setup, close them down and
then easily reload the setup at some other time.  LASH doesn't deal
with any kind of audio data itself; it just runs programs, deals
with saving/loading (arbitrary) data and connects different kinds
of virtual audio ports together (currently JACK and ALSA sequencer
ports).  It can also be used to move entire sessions between
computers, or post sessions on the Internet for download.
