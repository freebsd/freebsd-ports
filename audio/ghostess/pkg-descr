Ghostess is a a graphical DSSI host, based on jack-dssi-host, but
capable of saving and restoring plugin configuration, as well as
specifying MIDI channels and layering synths. ghostess includes
three MIDI drivers: an ALSA sequencer MIDI driver, a (clumsy but
functional) CoreMIDI driver (which allows ghostess to be used on
Mac OS X), and a JACK MIDI driver for use with the MIDI transport
in recent versions (>=0.102.27) of JACK. ghostess also comes with
a universal DSSI GUI, which attempts to provide GUI services for
any DSSI or LADSPA plugin, and may be used with any DSSI host.
