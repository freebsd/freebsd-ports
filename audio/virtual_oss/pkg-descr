Virtual OSS is an audio mixing application that multiplexes and
demultiplexes a single OSS device into multiple customizable OSS
compatible devices using character devices in userspace. These devices
can be used to record played back audio and mix the individual
channels in multiple ways.

Virtual OSS also supports playback and recording through bluetooth
audio devices.
