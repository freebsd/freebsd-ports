AcoustID fingerprinter is a cross-platform GUI application that
uses Chromaprint to submit audio fingerprints from your music
collection to the AcoustID database.  Only tagged audio files are
submitted.  Files tagged by MusicBrainz applications such as Picard
or Jaikoz are preferred, but it will submit fingerprints for any
files that have tags such as track title, artist name, album name,
etc.
