DSBMixer is a tabbed GTK+ mixer for FreeBSD. For each installed mixer device
as well as for USB sound devices plugged in at runtime, DSBMixer opens a tab.
Furthermore, it allows you to configure several aspects of your sound card(s),
such as selecting recording sources, choosing your default audio device, and
amplification.
