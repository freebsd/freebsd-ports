This package includes two programs for adjusting sound mixers:  xmixer, which
uses the Athena toolkit, and xgmixer, based on GTK+.  From the README:

    Features:
     * For every device which is supported by the soundcard you can
       change the volume via a slider. Unsupported devices are not shown.
     * Select the input device(s) for recording.
     * On startup a configuration file is read which restores device
       settings.
     * With a menu option you can save the current settings for the next
       start up.
     * Hide devices which you don't want to see.
     * Batch support - just read and evaluate the settings in the
       configuration file.
