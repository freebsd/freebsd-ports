Xaylet plays music files in the `.ay' format. These files are essentially
wrappers around bits of Z80 code which play music on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum
128's sound hardware - either the beeper, or (eponymously) the AY-3-8912 sound
chip. Files using the Amstrad CPC ports are also supported.

The sound hardware emulation is based on a Spectrum emulator Fuse.
