Squash is a C/Ncurses based music player. It supports mp3 and ogg through
libraries (and planned flac support).  Squash uses statistics to determine songs
to play automatically. It garners this information through whether or not a song
is skipped.  Squash also avoids picking the same song twice.  Thus Squash is
like a radio station that plays the songs you like -- and you don't even have to
call in requests!
