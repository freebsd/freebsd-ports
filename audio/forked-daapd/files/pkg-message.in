forked-daapd uses FFmpeg for transcoding audio playback.
The default ports/pkg build of FFmpeg on FreeBSD has a number
of options which could be SET/UNSET to provide support for
additional audio codecs.

If you find forked-daapd does not support the audio codecs you
require, it is recommended to recompile the multimedia/ffmpeg
package from ports with the necessary options ENABLED (SET).

You should review and edit the forked-daapd configuration
file %%PREFIX%%/etc/forked-daapd.conf before first use.

To automatically start forked-daapd at boot time:
# sysrc 'dbus_enable=YES'
# sysrc 'avahi_daemon_enable=YES'
# sysrc 'forked_daapd_enable=YES'

To then manually start forked-daapd without rebooting:
# service dbus start
# service avahi-daemon start
# service forked-daapd start
