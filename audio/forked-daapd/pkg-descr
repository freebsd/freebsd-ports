forked-daapd is a DAAP (iTunes), MPD (Music Player Daemon) and RSP (Roku) media
server. It is a complete rewrite of mt-daapd (Firefly Media Server).

It has support for AirPlay devices/speakers, Apple Remote (and compatibles),
MPD clients, Chromecast, network streaming, internet radio, Spotify and LastFM.

It does not support streaming video by AirPlay nor Chromecast.

DAAP stands for Digital Audio Access Protocol, and is the protocol used
by iTunes and friends to share/stream media libraries over the network.

RSP is Roku's own media sharing protocol. Roku are the makers of the
SoundBridge devices.
