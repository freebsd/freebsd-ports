Open Cubic Player first appeared around December 1994 as a DOS
binary-only module player. It supported many soundcards and module
formats.

At some point, the source code was released to the public under the
terms of the GNU General Public License, and around 2003 Stian
Skjelstad ported the code to Linux.

In addition to legacy tracker formats such as mod, xm and s3m, Open
Cubic Player now also supports mp3 and ogg files.
