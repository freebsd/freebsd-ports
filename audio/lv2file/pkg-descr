lv2file is a simple program which you can use to apply effects to your audio
files without much hassle. Possible use cases are:
* When you want to apply an effect without having to open a GUI or start
  a project.
* When you want to apply effects to a large number of files, or in
  an automated manner.
* When you need a deterministic environment to debug a plugin.
* You like everything to be on the command line.

lv2file uses the LV2 plugin format (http://lv2plug.in/) for the effects it uses.
