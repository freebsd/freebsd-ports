MOC (music on console) is a console audio player designed to be powerful and
easy to use.

MOC plays smoothly, regardless of system or I/O load, because it handles the
output buffer in a separate thread. It does not cause gaps between files,
because the next file to be played is pre-cached while playing the current
file.

Supported file formats are: MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Musepack (mpc), Speex, WAVE,
AIFF, AU, SVX, Sphere Nist WAV, IRCAM SF, Creative VOC, AAC, MP4, Real, WMA.
