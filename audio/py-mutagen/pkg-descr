Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata. It supports
FLAC, M4A, Musepack, MP3, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Speex, Ogg Theora, Ogg
Vorbis, MonkeysAudio, True Audio, and WavPack audio files. All
versions of ID3v2 are supported, and all standard ID3v2.4 frames
are parsed. It can read Xing headers to accurately calculate the
bitrate and length of MP3s. ID3 and APEv2 tags can be edited
regardless of audio format. It can also manipulate Ogg streams
on an individual packet/page level.
