Cantus is an easy to use tool for tagging and renaming MP3 and OGG/Vorbis files.
It has many features including mass tagging and renaming of MP3s, the ability to
generate a tag out of the filename, filter definitions for renaming, recursive
actions, CDDB (Freedb) lookup (no CD needed), copy between ID3V1 and ID3V2 tags,
and a lot more.
