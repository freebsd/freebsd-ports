IMPORTANT! MAKE SURE TO READ THE FOLLOWING!

To use the driver, make a copy of %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/aureal.sh.sample under 
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/aureal.sh and do: chmod +x %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/aureal.sh.

To load the driver run (as root):

# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/aureal.sh start

To unload it:

# %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/aureal.sh stop

It'll also load the driver automatically when the system is started.

In case it fails to detect the type of your Vortex soundcard correctly,
edit this script and set "CARD=" to 88X0 where X is 1, 2 or 3 depending 
on which Aureal chipset you have - au8810 (Vortex Advantage), au8820 
(Vortex 1) or au8830 (Vortex 2) correspondingly.

If your system is based on a Via Apollo KX133 chipset, your computer will
most likely lock up soon after playback is started. This is a known issue.
Make sure to uncomment "VIAKX133FIX=yes" in aureal.sh start-up script.

Please note that you also need to have a `snd_pcm.ko' module either already
loaded or placed into appropriate location for modules on your system (default
is /modules/ on 4-STABLE and /boot/kernel/ on 5-CURRENT). You can compile and
install snd_pcm by doing:

# cd /sys/modules/sound/pcm/ && make all install

Report problems to Alexander Matey <ports@matey.org>.

Thanks and enjoy!
