Sphinx Base is part of a large-vocabulary, speaker-independent, continuous
speech recognition engine.

This port is required for PocketSphinx and Sphinx3

Once the system is built, try running the Perl script sphinx-demo.
The sphinx-test script should run sphinx-batch over an example
utterance of "go forward ten meters."
