Yammi ("Yet Another Music Manager I...") is a tool to manage your song 
collection (mp3, ogg, wav). For playing songs the program serves as a front-end
for either XMMS or Noatun.

Features:
- conveniently search for songs (fuzzy search)
- organize your songs into playlists/categories
- keep statistics (when/how many times was song x played?)
- support for id3 and ogg tag reading and writing (including id3v2)
- easily keep your song info (tags and filenames) consistent
- assist in burning your song collection to multiple CDs
- act as a jukebox, loading song files on demand from removable media
- prelisten to songs on headphone to DJ your own party (needs a second sound 
  device)
- invoke other programs such as k3b, cdlabelgen or your own scripts to burn CDs,
  generate CD labels or execute other commands using the information from 
  Yammi's song database
