======================================================================
It is recommended to run Jack with real-time priority (-R).

The recommended way to start Jack is to add the following
lines to /etc/rc.conf:

jackd_enable="YES"
jackd_user="{your-jack-user}"
jackd_rtprio="YES"
jackd_args="-R -doss -r{sample-rate} -p1024 -n3 -w16 \
            --capture /dev/dsp{N} --playback /dev/dsp{N}"

Where:
- your-jack-user: is the user who is going to use jack; currently
                  only one user is supported
- sample-rate: can be 44100, 48000, etc.
- /dev/dsp{N}: your OSS devices, usually /dev/dsp0

Please note that the port option COOKEDMODE is "on" by default, which
makes your system to automatically scale the sample-rate between
Jack and audio hardware. One reason COOKEDMODE=on is because
Jack's OSS driver doesn't support some sample-rate and hardware
combinations when COOKEDMODE=off. To achieve the best sound quality
please make sure your hardware natively supports the sample-rate set
in jackd_args, and set COOKEDMODE=off.
