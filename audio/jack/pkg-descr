JACK is a low-latency audio server, written for POSIX conformant 
operating systems. It can connect a number of different applications 
to an audio device, as well as allowing them to share audio between 
themselves. Its clients can run in their own processes (ie. as normal 
applications), or can they can run within the JACK server (ie. as a 
"plugin"). 

JACK was designed from the ground up for professional audio work, and 
its design focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all 
clients, and low latency operation.
