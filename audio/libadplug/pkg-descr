AdPlug is a free, cross-platform, hardware independent AdLib sound player
library, mainly written in C++ and released under the LGPL. AdPlug plays
sound data, originally created for the AdLib (OPL2) audio board, directly
from its original format on top of an OPL2 emulator or by using the real
hardware. No OPL chip is required for playback.
