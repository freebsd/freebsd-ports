Pulseaudio tries to determine default values for FreeBSD OSS driver at first
start, based on /dev/sndstat output. The hw.snd.default_unit sysctl may affect
these values, but restart of the Pulseaudio might be needed to rescan it again,
e.g. `pacmd exit`.

Pulseaudio has separate input and output configure lines. You can change them
with using following commands:

To change the default sink (output):
# pacmd set-default-sink 3
To change the default source (input):
# pacmd set-default-source 3

This can also be set in %%PREFIX%%/etc/pulse/default.pa

Replace the number '3' with the new default you want to set.


The audio/freedesktop-sound-theme is needed if the default sound files
are uncommented in the %%PREFIX%%/etc/pulse/default.pa file.
