Pulseaudio doesn't know about the hw.snd.default_unit=3 sysctl for the
FreeBSD OSS driver that is used to select the active input/output. So
for Pulseaudio we also need to tell it which input/output to use. The
difference is that Pulseaudio has separate input and output configure lines.

To change the default sink (output):
# pacmd set-default-sink 3
To change the default source (input):
# pacmd set-default-source 3

This can also be set in %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/pulse/default.pa

Replace the number '3' with the new default your want to set.


The audio/freedesktop-sound-theme is needed if the default sound files
are uncommented in the %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/pulse/default.pa file.
