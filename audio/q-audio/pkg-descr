This package contains two modules to write digital audio applications in the Q
programming language:

- The audio module implements a (near-)realtime audio interface on top of Phil
  Burk's PortAudio library V1.8 (http://www.portaudio.com/).

- The sndfile module allows you to access sound files in various formats using
  Erik de Castro Lopo's libsndfile library V1.0 or later
  (http://www.zip.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile/).

Also included is a GGI-based wave renderer (draw_wave.q) and a simple
graphical audio player application (audio_player.q).
