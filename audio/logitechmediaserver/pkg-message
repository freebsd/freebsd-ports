The 8.5.1 Server added a "Report Analytics Data plugin" that is
enabled by default and sends analytics some minutes after it is first
run. More information is available from the community.

https://lyrion.org/analytics/learn-more/

You can disable this, but it's recommended to keep on for help in
determing future support.

Note on security settings:

The slimserver service is wide open, and by default there is no password.
You can control access to your music collection by pointing your web
browser to http://localhost:9000/, and then choosing:

Server Settings -> Security

Note on upgrade to 8.2:

Older slim devices have a bug where they will not see 8.2 as newer than 7.9
and will prompt you to update, there is a patch for this that must be
installed BEFORE upgrading the logitechmediaserver to 8.x.

To install the patch:
1. Go to Settings/Advanced/Applet Instlaler and UNCHECK Recommended Applets Only
2. Go to Settings/Advanced/Applet Installer and install "PatchInstaller"
3. Go to Settings/Advanced/Patch Installer and install "Version Comparison Fix"

Additionally, after installation you can install the plugin
"Community Firmware for Touch/Radio/Controller" on LMS and get newer firmware
for your devices!
