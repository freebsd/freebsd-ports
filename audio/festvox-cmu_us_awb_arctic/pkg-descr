US English Scottish male voice by the Language Technologies Institute
at Carnegie Mellon University constructed from phonetically balanced,
US English single speaker database designed for unit selection
speech synthesis research.

The speaker is very experienced in building synthetic voices and
matched prompted US English, though his vowels are very different
from US English vowels. Scottish English speakers will probably
find synthesizers based on this voice strange.
