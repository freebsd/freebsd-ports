The xsynth-dssi package contains the Xsynth-DSSI plugin, a
classic-analog (VCOs-VCF-VCA) style software synthesizer with an
editor GUI.  Xsynth-DSSI was written by Sean Bolton, and was based
on Steve Brooke's Xsynth code, but has since aquired polyphonic
operation, band-limited oscillators, a better filter mode, and
velocity-sensitive envelopes.
