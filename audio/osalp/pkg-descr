This is the home page for the Open Source Audio Library Project. This is a
project designed to implement a world class set of classes in C++ that will
handle all of the audio functions one would like. It is designed to be multi-
platform with UNIX based platforms as the base. This project is still in the
beta code phase and a beta version that will illustrate the power and
flexibility is now available. This version supports the Linux (OSS) audio
device, Solaris Sparc audio device, FreeBSD (OSS) audio device, wav, au, aiff,
aifc, mp3, and numerousother formats. It is important to note that this is
not an application but a C++ library that others can use to create an audio
application or to easly add audio capabilities to an existing application.
