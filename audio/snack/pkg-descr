The Snack Sound Toolkit is designed to be used with a scripting language
such as Tcl/Tk or Python. Using Snack you can create powerful multi-platform
audio applications with just a few lines of code. Snack has commands for
basic sound handling, e.g. sound card and disk I/O. Snack also has primitives
for sound visualization, e.g. waveforms and spectrograms. It was developed
mainly to handle digital recordings of speech, but is just as useful for
general audio. Snack has also successfully been applied to other one-
dimensional signals.

The combination of Snack and a scripting language makes it possible to create
sound tools and applications with a minimum of effort. This is due to the
rapid development nature of scripting languages. As a bonus you get an
application that is cross-platform from start. It is also easy to integrate
Snack based applications with existing sound analysis software.
