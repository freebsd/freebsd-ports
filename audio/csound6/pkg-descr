Csound is a programming language designed and optimized for sound
rendering and signal processing. The language consists of over 450
opcodes - the operational codes that the sound designer uses to build
"instruments" or patches.

Although there are an increasing number of graphical "front-ends" for
the language, you typically design and modify your patches using a word
processor. Usually, you create two text files - a .orc (orchestra) file
containing the "instruments," and a .sco (score) file containing the
"notes."

In Csound, the complexity of your patches is limited by your knowledge,
interest, and need, but never by the language itself. For instance, a
22,050 oscillator additive synthesizer with 1024 stage envelope
generators on each is merely a copy-and-paste operation. The same goes
for a 1 million voice granular texture!

Have you ever dreamed of sounds such as these? Well in Csound you can.
And in Csound these dreams can come true!
