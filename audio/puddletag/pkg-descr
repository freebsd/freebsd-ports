Puddletag is a audio tag editor similar to Windows program Mp3tag. Unlike most
taggers, it uses a spreadsheet-like layout so that all the tags you want to
edit by hand are visible and easily editable.

Supported formats: ID3v1, ID3v2 (mp3), MP4 (mp4, m4a, etc.), VorbisComments
(ogg, flac), Musepack (mpc), Monkey's Audio (.ape) and WavPack (wv)
