The Thunar Media Tags Plugin (thunar-media-tags-plugin) adds special features
for media files to the Thunar File Manager.

Currently, these are:
  * a so-called bulk renamer, which allows users to rename multiple audio
    files at once, based on their tags (e.g. ID3 or OGG/Vorbis),
  * a special media file page for the file properties dialog, which
    displays detailed information about quality, length etc.,
  * and finally, an audio tag editor which is reachable from both,
    renamer and the properties page.
