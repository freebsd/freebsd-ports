This is a Logitech Media Server plugin to add lazy search capabilities.
Lazy searching allows for much faster entry of search text by allowing
you to forget about multi-tapping and instead just press each of the
remote control buttons once for each of the letters in the text,
whatever position the letter appears in above the button.
