Type headsetcontrol -h to get all available options.

Type headsetcontrol -? to get a list of supported capabilities for the currently detected headset.

headsetcontrol -s 128 sets the sidetone to 128 (REAL loud). You can silence it with 0. I recommend a loudness of 16.

The following options don't work on all devices yet:

headsetcontrol -b check battery level. Returns a value from 0 to 100 or loading.

headsetcontrol -n 0|1 sends a notification sound, made by the headset. 0 or 1 are currently supported as values.

headsetcontrol -l 0|1 switches LED off/on (off almost doubles battery lifetime!).

headsetcontrol --short-output cut unnecessary output, for reading by other scripts or applications.

headsetcontrol -i 0-90 sets inactive time in minutes, time must be between 0 and 90, 0 disables the feature.

headsetcontrol -m retrieves the current chat-mix-dial level setting between 0 and 128. Below 64 is the game side and above is the chat side.

headsetcontrol -v 0|1 turn voice prompts on or off.

headsetcontrol -r 0|1 turn rotate to mute feature on or off.

headsetcontrol --dev Advanced menu for developers, to send and/or receive custom data

headsetcontrol -p 0-3 sets equalizer preset, must be between 0 and 3, 0 is the default preset.
