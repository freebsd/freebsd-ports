DrumGizmo is an open source, multichannel, multilayered, cross-platform drum
plugin and stand-alone application. It enables you to compose drums in midi and
mix them with a multichannel approach. It is comparable to that of mixing a real
drumkit that has been recorded with a multimic setup.

Features include:
* Stand-alone, Lv2 and VSTi versions available
* Open drumkit file format, allowing the community to create their own drumkits
* Drum velocity, allowing for several different hit velocities for each drum
* Multichannel output, making it possible to mix it just the way you would a
  real drumkit
* Optional built-in humanizer, analyzing the midi notes, adjusting velocities
  on-the-fly
* Stand-alone midi renderer, generating .wav files, 1 for each channel
* Stand-alone midi input, making it possible to use DrumGizmo as a software
  sampler for an electronic drumkit
