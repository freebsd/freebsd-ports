from the authors:

The Festival Speech Synthesis System is a general multi-lingual
text-to-speech system for Unix platforms.  It is written in C++ and
includes a Scheme-based scripting language.  Included with Festival
are lexicons and voices that together form a whole text-to-speech
system.

For output via esd do:

	(Parameter.set 'Audio_Method 'esdaudio)

NAS and direct output are documented in section 23 of the users'
manual.

If you need the OGI extensions, install ports/audio/festival+OGI instead.
