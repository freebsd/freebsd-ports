terminatorX is a realtime audio synthesizer that allows you to "scratch" on 
digitally sampled audio data (*.wav, *.au, *.mp3, etc.) the way hiphop-DJs
scratch on vinyl records. 

It features multiple turntables, realtime
effects (buit-in as well as LADSPA plugin effects), a sequencer and
an easy-to- use gtk+ GUI.
