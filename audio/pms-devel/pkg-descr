Practical Music Search (PMS) is an interactive console client for the Music
Player Daemon, written in Go. Its interface is similar to Vim, and aims to be
fast, configurable, and practical. PMS has many features that involve sorting,
searching, and navigating. It is designed to let you navigate your music
collection in an effective way.
This is a complete rewrite of the previously existing pms which was written in
C++.
