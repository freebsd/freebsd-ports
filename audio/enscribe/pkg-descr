Enscribe creates digital audio watermark images from photographic
images. These images can only be seen using a third party frequency vs
time display, such as Baudline (audio/baudline).

Images are still visible even after such audio mangling techniques as
MP3/Ogg compression, reverb, chorus, etc. Heavy EQ and flange can
stripe out vertical sections, but they can also ruin an otherwise good
song as well.
