MPEG Maaate (pronounce: ma:a:it) is a C++ toolkit to parse and
analyse audio data in the compressed domain by analysing MPEG-1/2
Layers 1-3 audio files. It makes the encoded fields of an MPEG
audio stream accessible (tier1) and provides some content analysis
functions like silence detection (tier2).

MPEG Maaate is designed in tiers: the first tier implements the
parsing of the MPEG audio stream, the second tier implements the
content analysis on the extracted field, and the third tier includes
any applications that are based on the extracted content.
