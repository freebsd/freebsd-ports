nekobee is a DSSI soft synth plugin that emulates the sound of the
TB-303 Bassline.  It is not an exact copy; rather than make it "just
like the real thing", the design concentrates on modelling the
circuitry and was adjusted by comparing the sounds achievable with
it to those heard on classic acid house tracks.  It includes a
switchable square/saw wave VCO, 24dB/octave VCF, an adjustable decay
time for the VCF, a fixed decay time for the VCA, and an interesting
bit of circuitry around the "Accent" control.
