This is an audio mixer that can run within the WindowMaker
window manager "Dock". Some more information can be found at:

To run it, type:

	wmmixer -w &

Drag the application to the dock. Once it's part of the dock, right-click
to bring up the properties and select "Autolaunch". Oh yeah, you'll need
a sound card. :-)
