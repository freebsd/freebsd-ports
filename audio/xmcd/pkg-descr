Xmcd is a program that allows the use of the CD-ROM drive as a
full-featured stereo compact-disc player for the X Window System.

Most of the features found on real CD players are available in
xmcd, such as shuffle and repeat, track programming functions, a
numeric keypad, and track warp slider for direct track access.
Additional functions include sample play, A to B segment play,
volume control, balance control, etc.  Several automation options
are also available on CD load, eject, play completion, and program
exit.  A Channel Routing feature allows you to select from several
stereo or mono routing options.  The volume control slider taper
characteristics can also be altered.
