Qsynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around
the Qt toolkit using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve into a
softsynth management application allowing the user to control and manage
a variety of command line softsynth but for the moment it wraps the
excellent FluidSynth.
