Python Audio Tools are a collection of audio handling programs which work from
the command line. These include programs for CD extraction, track conversion
from one audio format to another, track renaming and retagging, track
identification, CD burning from tracks, and more. Supports internationalized
track filenames and metadata using Unicode. Works with high-definition,
multi-channel audio as well as CD-quality. Track conversion uses multiple CPUs
or CPU cores if available to greatly speed the transcoding process. Track
metadata can be retrieved from FreeDB, MusicBrainz or compatible servers.
