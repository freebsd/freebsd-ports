has excellent technical abilities like multitrack editing, unlimited
undo/redo support, real-time synthesis support, 32bit audio rendering,
full duplex support, multiprocessor support, precise timing down to
sample granularity, on demand loading of partial wave files, on the
fly decoding and full scriptability in scheme. The plugins, synthesis
core and the user interface are actively being developed and
translated into a variety of languages, regularly assimilating user
feedback such as from our FeatureRequests page.
