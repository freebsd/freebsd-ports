Jalv runs LV2 plugins and exposes their ports as Jack ports, essentially
making any LV2 plugin function as a Jack application.

Jalv is a small program which is useful, but also intended to be an appropriate
test host for plugin development. It runs plugins from the command line with no
user interaction, is light enough to run in valgrind, and is capable of dumping
all plugin to/from UI communication in a human readable format.
