WMRecord is a general purpose audio recording utility that is designed to
work in conjuction with WindowMaker's Dock or AfterStep's Wharf.

It was originally conceived as a tool for recording memos, interviews
and meetings, and this approach is reflected somewhat in the interface.
Recordings are made to one of 99 numbered slots or tracks which the user
may browse through. There is no limit (other than the constraints of the
file system) to the size of the recordings you make. Recordings are
automatically saved to disk, but may be erased or recorded over as
necessary.
