Audio::Ecasound provides perl bindings to the ecasound control
interface of the ecasound program. You can use perl to automate or
interact with ecasound so you don't have to turn you back on the
adoring masses packed into Wembly Stadium.

Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
processing. It can be used for audio playback, recording, format
conversions, effects processing, mixing, as a LADSPA plugin host and
JACK node. Version >= 2.2.X must be installed to use this
package. "SEE ALSO" for more info.
