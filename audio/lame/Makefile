# http://www.mp3licensing.com/ only talks about the FhG and Technicolor patent portfolio
# but there are also portfolios from Sisvel (from Philips) and
# Nokia (from AT&T -> Lucent -> Alcatel).
# Some "old" patents are now expired, but there are more recent MP3 patents. Some
# of the more recent ones are multi-channel related, which is not implemented in LAME.
# There was no investigation (in the LAME project) about which patent exists, which
# one is implemented in LAME, and which one is not (yet) expired. As such it is not
# known if LAME could now be distributed as a binary package or not.
# Linux distributions seem to go the "let's see if get sued" way, FreeBSD doesn't
# follow this.
