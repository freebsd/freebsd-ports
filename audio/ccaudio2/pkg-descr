GNU ccAudio2 is a stand-alone portable C++ class framework for manipulating
audio data.  GNU ccAudio2 offers platform indipendent classes for directly
accessing audio files from disk. These classes are endian aware and also,
unlike some audio file manipulation libraries, content format aware;
ccAudio treats audio as an array of descreat sample points rather than simply
as binary data. ccAudio can also manipulate header information such as
annotations. GNU ccAudio2 supports sun audio, raw samples, and RIFF encoded
audio data.  In addition to manipulating audio thru disk files, GNU ccAudio2
can provide audio processing of sample sets in memory. This includes generation
of pure tones, energy measurement of audio poackets, and software codec
conversions.  GNU ccAudio2 includes a framework for developing plugin audio
codecs and is intended to be a carrier for freely licensed audio codecs as well
as to expand into a general purpose audio/signal processing C++ library.
