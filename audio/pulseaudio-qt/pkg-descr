Pulseaudio bindings for Qt.

PulseAudio is a sound system for POSIX OSes, meaning that it is a proxy for
your sound applications. It allows you to do advanced operations on your sound
data as it passes between your application and your hardware. Things like
transferring the audio to a different machine, changing the sample format or
channel count and mixing several sounds into one are easily achieved using a
sound server.
