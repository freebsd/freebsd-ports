Zita-resampler is a C++ library for resampling audio signals. It is designed to
be used within a real-time processing context, to be fast, and to provide
high-quality sample rate conversion.

The library operates on signals represented in single-precision floating point
format. For multichannel operation both the input and output signals are assumed
to be stored as interleaved samples.

The API allows a trade-off between quality and CPU load. For the latter a range
of approximately 1:6 is available. Even at the highest quality setting
libzita-resampler will be faster than most similar libraries providing the same
quality, e.g. libsamplerate.
