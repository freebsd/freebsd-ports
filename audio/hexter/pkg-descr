hexter is a software synthesizer that models the sound generation
of a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer. It can easily load most DX7 patch bank
files, accept patch editing commands via MIDI sys-ex messages (ALSA
systems only), and recreate the sound of the DX7 with greater
accuracy than any previous open-source emulation (that the author
is aware of....)

hexter operates as a plugin for the Disposable Soft Synth Interface
(DSSI).
