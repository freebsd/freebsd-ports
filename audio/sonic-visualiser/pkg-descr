Sonic Visualiser is a program for viewing and analysing the contents
of music audio files.

It supports serveral audio file formats and displays their waveforms
and spectograms in a straightforward way. The audio data can be
annotated and played back featuring time streching. Furthermore it
can be extended by third-party vamp plugins for feature extraction.
