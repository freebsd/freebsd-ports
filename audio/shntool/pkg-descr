shntool is a multi-purpose .wav/.shn processing tool.  Input and
output files are transparent to shntool, meaning that it can
perform its functions upon both .wav and .shn data.

When in 'len' (length) mode, it reports .wav size and length information
from both .wav and .shn files, including whether each file is (a) too
short to be burned to disc, (b) not cut on a sector boundary, or (c)
contains incorrect header information.

When in 'fix' mode, shntool is capable of rewriting a set of input
files so that they are all cut on sector boundaries.  You may specify
whether shntool shifts the track boundaries (a) forward to the next
multiple of the block size, or (b) backward to the previous multiple
of the block size.  Alternatively, you may join the input files into
one large output file, so you can do the splitting yourself (with
another .wav editor - shntool isn't that advanced yet).
