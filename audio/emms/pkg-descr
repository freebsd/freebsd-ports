Emms is the Emacs Multimedia System.
Emms displays and plays multimedia from within GNU/Emacs
using a variety of external players and from different sources.

Emms can run as a minimalist player and controlled with a handful of
M-x Emacs commands, or a fully-fledged, interactive media browser.
Emms can display album art, play streaming audio, tag music files,
search for lyrics, provide MPD connectivity, control the volume, and more.
