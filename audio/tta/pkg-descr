TTA performs lossless compression on multichannel 8, 16, and 24 bits data of
the Wav audio files.  Being "lossless" means that no data quality is lost in
the compression -- when uncompressed, all the data will be identical to the
original.  The compression ratios of TTA depend on the type of music files
being compressed, but the compression size will generally range between 30%
and 70% of the original.  TTA format supports both of ID3v1/2 and APEv2 tags.
