Giada is a free, minimal, hardcore audio tool for DJs, live performers and
electronic musicians. How does it work? Just pick up your channel, fill it
with samples or MIDI events and start the show by using this tiny piece of
software as a loop machine, drum machine, sequencer, live sampler or yet as
a plugin/effect host. Giada aims to be a compact and portable virtual device
for production use and live sets.
