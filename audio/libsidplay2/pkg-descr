Basically, SIDPLAY is just an ordinary music player software. More
specifically, it emulates the Sound Interface Device chip (MOS 6581,
known as SID) and the Micro Processor Unit (MOS 6510) of the
Commodore 64 on your computer. Its platform-independent software
emulates hardware components. Therefore it is able to load and execute
C64 machine code programs which produce music or sound. In general,
these are independent fragments of code and data which have been
ripped from games and demonstration programs and were transferred
directly from the C64. All you need is a supported operating system and
audio hardware with average PCM waveform playback capabilities. A
fast CPU and a 16-bit sound card are recommended for better
performance.

This is just the library. To actually use it, you need one of the
front-ends like 'sidplay' or 'xsidplay'.
