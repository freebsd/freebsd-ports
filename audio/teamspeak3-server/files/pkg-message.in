To enable the TeamSpeak server, set

  teamspeak_enable="YES"

in your /etc/rc.conf and then use it like any other service.

If you have a license file (licensekey.dat) and/or ts3server.ini,
put it into %%PREFIX%%/etc/teamspeak

To see the admin token after the first start, have a look
into the logs in /var/log/teamspeak

TeamSpeak DNS server (tsdns) is not handled by this port. If you
need id, please download and install it manually.
