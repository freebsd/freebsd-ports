put it into %%ETCDIR%%

into the logs in %%LOGDIR%%

TeamSpeak DNS server (tsdns) is not handled by this port. If you
need it, please download and install it manually.

Version 3.0.13 adds ipv6 support. To disable ipv6
printf "voice_ip=0.0.0.0\nfiletransfer_ip=0.0.0.0\n" >>\
%%ETCDIR%%/ts3server.ini
The default value is 0.0.0.0 / 0::0, which activates IPv6.
