Xamp is a version of amp with graphical interface provided by
qt toolkit. It comes with the amp-0.7.6 as the core player, as
well as two album management tools: Playlist Editor and ID3 Tag
Editor, and is able to change the background on the fly.

Although it's not as nifty as x11amp is, hopefully it takes less
CPU time and doesn't require OSS sound driver to run.

The program pretty much speaks for itself. You may consult the
man page or the document in the "About Xamp" panel for more
detail.

Have fun!
