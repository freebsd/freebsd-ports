Practical Music Search is an open source ncurses client for Music
Player Daemon, written in C++. The target audience are power users who
need an MPD client that is highly configurable and accessible. PMS
features a simple but powerful interface similar to Vim, and runs on
(at least) Linux and Mac OS X.
