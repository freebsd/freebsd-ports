************************************************************

The musicpd package has been successfully installed.

In order to run the MPD server, you need to create
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/mpd.conf out of
  %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/mpd/mpdconf.example
and add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:
  musicpd_enable="YES"

Then start the server with
  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/musicpd start
or reboot.

NOTE: The musicpd server is pretty useless without a
      client. You might want to install one of the following
      ports, too: mpc, glurp, gmpc, kmp or phpmp
