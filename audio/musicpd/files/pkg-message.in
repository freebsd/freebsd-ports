The musicpd package has been successfully installed.

In order to run the MPD server, you need to edit the provided
sample configuration file

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/musicpd.conf

Edit the variables in the section "Files and directories"
according to your local environment. Ensure that the referenced
directories exist and owned by the 'mpd' user, except for the
variable music_directory. It is sufficient for the 'mpd' user
to have read permissions to the referenced directory.

To enable the service at boot time, add the following line to
/etc/rc.conf:

	musicpd_enable="YES"

Then start the server with

	service musicpd start

or reboot.


NOTE: The musicpd server does not come with a client. In order
      to use it, you need one. They come in all shapes and
      sizes for many platforms (including iOS and Android for
      remote controlling musicpd from your smartphone).

      In the FreeBSD ports tree, there is a number of clients as
      well, for instance (non-exhaustive list):

      Command line: musicpc
      Curses: ncmpc, ncmpcpp, pms, pms-devel
      GNOME / GTK: ario, gimmix, glurp, gmpc, sonata
      KDE / Qt: cantana, quimup, qmpdlient
      Web: phpmp
