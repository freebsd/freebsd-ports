****************************************************************

The musicpd package has been successfully installed.

In order to run the MPD server, you need to edit the provided
sample configuration file

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/musicpd.conf

Edit the variables in the section "Files and directories"
according to your local environment. Ensure that the referenced
directories exist and owned by the 'mpd' user, except for the
variable music_directory. It is sufficient for the 'mpd' user
to have read permissions to the referenced directory.

To enable the service at boot time, add the following line to
/etc/rc.conf:

	musicpd_enable="YES"

Then start the server with

	service musicpd start

or reboot.


NOTE: The musicpd server is pretty useless without a client.
      You might want to install one of the following ports too:

      Command line: musicpc, ncmpc (Curses), ncmpcpp (Curses)
      GNOME / GTK: glurp, gmpc
      KDE / Qt: quimup, qmpdlient
      Web: phpmp
