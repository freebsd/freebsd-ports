****************************************************************

The musicpd package has been successfully installed.

In order to run the MPD server, you need to edit

	%%PREFIX%%/etc/musicpd.conf

and add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

	musicpd_enable="YES"

Then start the server with

	service musicpd start

or reboot.

The example configuration of MPD server requires music files to
be stored in the /var/mpd/music directory.

NOTE: The musicpd server is pretty useless without a client.
      You might want to install one of the following ports too:

      Command line: musicpc, ncmpc (Curses)
      GNOME / GTK: glurp, gmpc
      KDE / Qt: quimup, qmpdlient
      Web: phpmp
