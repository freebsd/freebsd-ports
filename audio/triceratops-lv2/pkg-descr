Triceratops is an analogue style polyphonic subtractive synthesizer plugin,
for use with the LV2 plug architecture, at this time there is no standalone
version. An up to date version of the LV2 library is required along with a
suitable host (e.g. Qtractor, Jalv, Ardour), I highly recommend either the
KXstudio distro or the KXstudio ubuntu repositories! The intention is for
this synth to be part of a suite including a drum machine (Stegosaurus) and
a wavetable synth (Dracorex), watch this space.
