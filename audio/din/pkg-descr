DIN Is Noise is a program for making sound, music and noise. Use
bezier curves to edit waveforms, envelopes, modulators and FX
components; use the keyboard (computer and MIDI) to trigger notes (or
noise), use the mouse to sound like the theremin, create drones on
microtones, launch, orbit and drag them around; bounce balls on walls
to trigger notes in a mondrian inspired drawing and also make binaural
beats. Supports MIDI input and scripting through TCL.
