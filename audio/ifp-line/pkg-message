NOTE:
ifp directly accesses the usb/ugen devices via libusb. So
if you want to use this application as a non-root user, you
have to make sure that the corresponding device nodes
/dev/usb<somenumber> and /dev/ugen<somenumber> where
<somenumber> is dependent on your personal usb environment
are readable and writable by the user intended to use the
tool.
