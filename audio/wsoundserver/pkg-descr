This is the sound server for Window Maker. To use it, execute "wmsound &" from 
an xterm, then dock the application icon. This package comes with a utility 
called nmaker that can be used to play .wav files. You can set nmaker to be 
the application to play .au and .wav files that you drop onto the docked 
wmsound icon.

Recent versions of Window Maker are built with sound enabled by default. If 
you are using an older version of Window Maker, you will have to add the 
following argument to configure: "--enable-sound" and rebuild and reinstall 
Window Maker, or upgrade to a newer version.

You must set up your sounds to use for various events, ie., iconification. You 
can get preset Sounsets from:
