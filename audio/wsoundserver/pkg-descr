WSoundServer is a rewritten from scratch reimplementation of a sound server
for WindowMaker, intended as a replacement for wmsound. To use it, execute
"wsoundserver &" from an xterm, then dock the application icon. This package
comes with a utility called wsoundplay that can be used to play .wav files.
You can set wsoundplay to be the application to play .au and .wav files that
you drop onto the docked wmsound icon.

A GUI configuration tool called WSoundPrefs coded in WINGs exists, which allows
to configure WSoundServer. WSoundPrefs available as a separate port named
wsoundprefs.
