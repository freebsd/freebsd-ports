from Martin Dupras' FAQ:
	Csound is a software synthesis package in the tradition of so-called
music-N languages, among which the best-known is Music V.  It consists of an
orchestra- and score-driven executable, written in C for portability.  Since
Csound is a computational language, it is highly flexible and efficient;
complexity is gained only at the expense of computation time.  Basically Csound
reads some files and creates the result as a file on disk or, on faster
machines, through a DAC in real time.
	Csound needs at least two files to read from:  the score, which is a
kind of event list for scheduling events, and an orchestra which defines how
Csound will synthesize those events.  An orchestra is composed of instruments,
which are basically processes triggered by the notes (events) in the score.
