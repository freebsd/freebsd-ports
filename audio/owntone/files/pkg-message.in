owntone uses FFmpeg for transcoding audio playback.
The default ports/pkg build of FFmpeg on FreeBSD has a number
of options which could be SET/UNSET to provide support for
additional audio codecs.

If you find owntone does not support the audio codecs you
require, it is recommended to recompile the multimedia/ffmpeg
package from ports with the necessary options ENABLED (SET).

You should review and edit the owntone configuration
file %%PREFIX%%/etc/owntone.conf before first use.

To automatically start owntone at boot time:
# sysrc 'dbus_enable=YES'
# sysrc 'avahi_daemon_enable=YES'
# sysrc 'owntone_enable=YES'

To then manually start owntone without rebooting:
# service dbus start
# service avahi-daemon start
# service owntone start
EOM
