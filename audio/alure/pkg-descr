ALURE is a utility library to help manage common tasks with OpenAL applications.
This includes device enumeration and initialization, file loading,
and streaming. As of version 1.1, it is X11/MIT licensed, allowing it to be used
in open- and closed-source programs, freeware or commercial.

The purpose of this library is to provide pre-made functionality that would
otherwise be repetitive or difficult to (re)code for various projects
and platforms, such as loading a sound file into an OpenAL buffer and streaming
an audio file through a buffer queue. Support for different formats is
consistant across platforms, so no special checks are needed when loading files,
and all formats are handled through the same API.

Currently ALURE includes a basic .wav and .aif file reader,
and can leverage external libraries such as libSndFile
(for extended wave formats and several others), VorbisFile (for Ogg Vorbis),
FLAC (for FLAC and Ogg FLAC), and others. External libraries can also be
dynamically loaded at run-time, or individually disabled outright at compile
time.
