crip is a terminal-based ripper/encoder/tagger tool for creating Ogg
Vorbis/FLAC files under UNIX/Linux. It is well-suited for anyone (especially
the perfectionist) who seeks to make a lot of files from CDs and have them all
properly labeled and professional-quality with a minimum of hassle and yet
still have flexibility and full control over everything.
