amp (Audio Mpeg Player) is an MPEG audio decoder which was originally started 
putting together as a side project of the MPEG hardware design project at 
FER/Zagreb - just to confirm my knowledge of the standard. It works with
both MPEG1 and MPEG2 audio streams, layer3 and for now the multichannel 
extensions defined in MPEG2 too.
