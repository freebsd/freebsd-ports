Audio Tag Tool is a program to manage the information fields in MP3 and
Ogg Vorbis files, commonly called tags. Tag Tool can be used to edit tags
one-by-one, but the most useful features are the ability to easily tag or
rename hundreds of files at once, in any desired format.

Tag Tool's features include:
    * Tag Editor
    * Multiple File Tagger
    * Clear Tags
    * Move/Rename Multiple Files
    * Create Playlists

The mass tag and mass rename features can handle filenames in any format
thanks to an easily configurable format template.
