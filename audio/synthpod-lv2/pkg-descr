Synthpod is an LV2 host. It can be run as a standalone app and be used as a
tool for live performances or general audio and event filtering.

It was conceptualized to fill the gap between pure textual (e.g. SuperCollider)
and pure visual flow (e.g. Pure Data) audio programming paradigms.

Potential fields of application may include:
* Live audio synthesis
* Real-time event scripting
* Non-linear signal routing
* Advanced control automation
* Advanced event filtering
* Live mixing
* Live coding
* Algorithmic composition
* Interfacing to expressive controllers
