You installed SynthPod: Lightweight Nonlinear LV2 Plugin Container

The major way to run it is to plug the LV2 plugin container to the
Jack sound server:

$ synthpod_jack -g

This shows you the design window where you can arrange plugins to
achieve the topology you like.

Please don't forget to connect SynthPod input and output in Jack. You
can normally do this with the UI command qjackctl from audio/qjackctl.

SynthPod is currently in alpha stage.
