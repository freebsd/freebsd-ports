Zsh is the Swiss Army knife of shells. It combines the most popular
features of every other shell, and then lets you customize every
inch of it. Users of bourne-style and C-style shells will feel at
home in it.

Zsh does intelligent completion, spell-checking, has a rich syntax
for precise globbing, and is fully extensible through plugin
systems.

To fire up the zsh completion system, type the following commands:

	$ autoload -U compinstall
	$ compinstall
