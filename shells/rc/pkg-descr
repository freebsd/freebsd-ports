Excerpts from the README:

  This is release 1.5 of rc.

  A unix version of the Plan-9 Shell.

  FEEPING CREATURISM

  See the end of the man page, under "INCOMPATABILITIES" for (known?)
  differences from the "real" rc. Most of these changes were necessary
  to get rc to work in a reasonable fashion on a real (i.e., commercial,
  non-Labs) UNIX system; a few were changes motivated by concern
  about some inadequacies in the original design.

  CREDITS

  This shell was written by Byron Rakitzis, but kudos go to Paul
  Haahr for letting me know what a shell should do and for contributing
  certain bits and pieces to rc (notably the limits code, print.c,
  most of which.c and the backquote redirection code).

eric.
