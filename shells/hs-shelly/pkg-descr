Shelly provides convenient systems programming in Haskell, similar in
spirit to POSIX shells. Shelly:

  * is aimed at convenience and getting things done rather than being a
    demonstration of elegance.
  * has detailed and useful error messages.
  * maintains its own environment, making it thread-safe.
  * is modern, using Text and system-filepath/system-fileio.

Shelly is originally forked from the Shellish package. See the shelly-extra
package for additional functionality.
