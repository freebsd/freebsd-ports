`FD' (FDclone) is a CUI-based file and directory management tool which
allows you to browse and manipulate directories and files with an easy
and intuitive user interface.  It also has a built-in Bourne-shell
compatible shell which can be run stand-alone by the name of `fdsh'.

This version is a clone of FD for DOS (AT and PC9801) designed and
written by A. Idei (SDI00544@niftyserve.or.jp).
