In the Unix tradition, it works with things already there and fills
a empty niche. When incorporating it into your Unix environment, you
keep your command line shell, your editor, your pager, and access to
all your tools, tricks and know-how. Vshnu can operate as an
optional supplemental visual mode to your command line shell. You
switch between command line and visual mode easily as you wish. Your
interface bandwidth and power for Unix operations is on a higher
plane and life gets sweeter.
