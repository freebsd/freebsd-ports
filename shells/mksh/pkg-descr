mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn
shell (pdksh), a bourne-compatible shell which is largely si-
milar to the original AT&T Korn shell.  It includes bug fixes
and feature improvements in order to produce a modern, robust
shell good for interactive and especially script use.  It has
UTF-8 support in the emacs command line editing mode; corres-
ponds to OpenBSD 4.1-beta ksh (minus GNU bash-like $PS1); the
build environment requirements are autoconfigured; throughout
code simplification/bugfix/enhancement has been done.

A sample ~/.mkshrc is included in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/mksh/
