GDS3D is an application that can interpret so called IC layouts and render them
in 3D. The program accepts standard GDSII files as input data. Along with the
layout file, it requires a so called process definition file which contains the
3D parameters of the process being used. These files combined allow the program
to create a 3D representation of an ASIC design.
