OpenTimer is a new static timing analysis (STA) tool to help IC designers
quickly verify the circuit timing. It is developed completely from the ground up
using C++17 to efficiently support parallel and incremental timing.

Key features are:
* Industry standard format (.lib, .v, .spef, .sdc) support
* Graph- and path-based timing analysis
* Parallel incremental timing for fast timing closure
* Award-winning tools and golden timers in CAD Contests
