NVC is a GPLv3 VHDL compiler and simulator aiming for IEEE 1076-2002 compliance.

- NVC supports almost all of VHDL-2008 with the exception of PSL, and it has
been successfully used to simulate several real-world designs. Experimental
support for Verilog and VHDL-2019 is under development.

- NVC has a particular emphasis on simulation performance and uses LLVM to
compile VHDL to native machine code.

- NVC is not a synthesizer. That is, it does not output something that could be
used to program an FPGA or ASIC. It implements only the simulation behaviour of
the language as described by the IEEE 1076 standard.

- NVC supports popular verification frameworks including OSVVM, UVVM, VUnit and
cocotb.
