Open CASCADE Technology is a software development platform freely available in
open source. It includes components for 3D surface and solid modeling,
visualization, data exchange and rapid application development.

Open CASCADE Technology can be best applied in development of numerical
simulation software including CAD/CAM/CAE, AEC and GIS, as well as PDM
applications.

BUGS: the interesting parts of this port are the libraries, but some components
      like Wok are not [yet] fully functional.
