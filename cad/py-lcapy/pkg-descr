Lcapy is an experimental Python package for teaching linear circuit
analysis.  It uses SymPy for symbolic mathematics.

Lcapy can analyse circuits described with netlists using modified
nodal analysis.

Alternatively, Lcapy can analyse networks and circuits formed by
combining one, two, and (some) three port networks.
