CIDER is a mixed-level circuit and device simulator.  CIDER attempts to
provide greater simulation accuracy than a stand-alone circuit or device
simulator can provide.  CIDER is based on the sequential mixed-level
circuit and device simulator, CODECS.  In common with CODECS, CIDER embeds
the circuit simulator, SPICE3, which provides circuit simulation
capabilities, analytical models for semiconductor devices, and an
interactive user interface.  An interface to the captive device simulator,
DSIM, provides accurate, one- and two-dimensional numerical models based
on the solution of Poisson's equation, and the electron and hole current-
continuity equations.  The input format of CIDER couples SPICE-like
circuit descriptions to a device description format similar to the one
used by the PISCES device simulator developed at Stanford University.
As a result, CIDER should seem reasonably familiar to designers already
accustomed to both these tools.

SPICE is a general-purpose circuit simulation program for nonlinear DC,
nonlinear transient, and linear AC analyses. Circuits may contain resistors,
capacitors, inductors, mutual inductors, independent voltage and current
sources, four types of dependent sources, lossless and lossy transmission
lines (two separate implementations), switches, uniform distributed RC
lines, and the five most common semiconductor devices: diodes, BJTs, JFETs,
MESFETs, and MOSFETs.
