This port installs the official schematic and 3D libraries supported by the
KiCad library team.

The footprint libraries are the *.pretty repos themselves and are used online by
default. If you want to download them locally, the library-repos-install.bat and
library-repos-install.sh scripts in the KiCad source can do this automatically.
