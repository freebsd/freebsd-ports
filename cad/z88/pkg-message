Z88 normally assumes that all the files for the software are located
in the same directory - i.e. all binaries, configuration files, input
and output files should be in the same directory. The port instead
installs the files in standard locations consistently with FreeBSD
policies.
A directory is created for every user at the first execution of z88
(just run "z88" in a terminal) with path ${HOME}/.z88 and has the role
of the main directory assumed by Z88: it is automatically populated as
needed by copying or linking to the files installed in the standard
locations.

The port sets gedit as default editor and firefox as default web
browser: you can change it for a particular user by modifying the file
${HOME}/.z88/z88.fcd.
No explicit dependency on gedit or firefox is set in the port, hence
if a user really wants to use gedit or firefox it is necessary to
install them manually on the system.
