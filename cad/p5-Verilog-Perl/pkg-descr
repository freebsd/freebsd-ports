The Verilog-Perl library is a building point for Verilog support in the Perl 
language. It includes:
* Verilog::Getopt which parses command line options similar to C++ and VCS.
* Verilog::Language which knows the language keywords and parses numbers.
* Verilog::Netlist which builds netlists out of Verilog files. This allows 
  easy scripts to determine things such as the hierarchy of modules.
* Verilog::Parser invokes callbacks for language tokens.
* Verilog::Preproc preprocesses the language, and allows reading 
  post-processed files right from Perl without temporary files.
* vpassert inserts PLIish warnings and assertions for any simulator.
* vppreproc preprocesses the complete Verilog 2001 and SystemVerilog language.
* vrename renames and cross-references Verilog symbols. Vrename creates Verilog
  cross references and makes it easy to rename signal and module names across 
  multiple files. Vrename uses a simple and efficient three step process. 
  First, you run vrename to create a list of signals in the design. You then 
  edit this list, changing as many symbols as you wish. Vrename is then run a 
  second time to apply the changes.
