Verilog-mode.el is a Verilog mode for Emacs which provides context-sensitive
highlighting, auto indenting, and provides macro expansion capabilities to
greatly reduce Verilog coding time.

Recent versions allow you to insert AUTOS in non-AUTO designs, so IP
interconnect can be easily modified. You can also expand Verilog-2001 ".*"
instantiations, to see what ports will be connected by simulators.
