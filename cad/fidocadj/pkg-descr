FidoCadJ is an easy to use graphical editor, with a library of electrical
symbols and footprints (traditional and SMD). It aims to be an agile and
effective small EDA tool for hobbyists. 

FidoCadJ stores its drawings in a compact text format, practical for the
copy and paste in newsgroups and forums: this has determined its success
on the Usenet and in numerous communities.
