VARKON can be used as a traditional CAD-system with drafting, modelling 
and visualization if you want to but the real power of VARKON is in 
parametric modelling and CAD applications development. VARKON includes 
interactive parametric modelling in 2D or 3D but also the unique MBS 
programming language integrated in the graphical environment.

The system was originally developed by a group at the University of 
Linkoping in Sweden during 1984-86 under the leadership of Dr. Johan 
Kjellander who was then the president of Microform AB. From 1986 the 
system was owned, marketed and further developed by Microform AB. The 
sourcecode of VARKON is now maintained by the CAD research group at the 
Department of Technology at Orebro University in Sweden.
