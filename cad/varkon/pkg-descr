VARKON can be used as a traditional CAD-system with drafting, modelling
and visualization if you want to but the real power of VARKON is in
parametric modelling and CAD applications development. VARKON includes
interactive parametric modelling in 2D or 3D but also the unique MBS
programming language integrated in the graphical environment.

The system was originally developed by a group at the University of
Linkoping in Sweden during 1984-86 under the leadership of Dr. Johan
Kjellander who was then the president of Microform AB. From 1986 the
system was owned, marketed and further developed by Microform AB.
