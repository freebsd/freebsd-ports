Fritzing is an Electronic Design Automation software with a low
entry barrier, suited for the needs of designers and artists. It
uses the metaphor of the breadboard, so that it is easy to transfer
your hardware sketch to the software. From there it is possible to
create PCB layouts for turning it into a robust PCB yourself or by
help of a manufacturer.
