NETGEN is an automatic 3D tetrahedral mesh generator.

It accepts input from constructive solid geometry (CSG) or boundary
representation (BRep) from STL file format. The connection to a geometry
kernel allows the handling of IGES and STEP files. NETGEN contains modules
for mesh optimization and hierarchical mesh refinement.

Netgen/NGSolve is a high performance multiphysics finite element software.
It is widely used to analyze models from solid mechanics, fluid dynamics and
electromagnetics. Due to its flexible Python interface new physical equations
and solution algorithms can be implemented easily.
