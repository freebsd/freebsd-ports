Xyce (zis, rhymes with "spice") is an open source,
SPICE-compatible, high-performance analog circuit simulator, capable
of solving extremely large circuit problems by supporting large-scale
parallel computing platforms. It also supports serial execution on all
common desktop platforms, and small-scale parallel runs on Unix-like
systems. In addition to analog electronic simulation, Xyce has also
been used to investigate more general network systems, such as neural
networks and power grids. Read more about Xyce.
