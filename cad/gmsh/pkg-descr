Gmsh is an automatic 3D finite element mesh generator (primarily 
Delaunay) with build-in CAD and post-processing facilities. Its primal 
design goal is to provide a simple meshing tool for academic test cases 
with parametric input and up to date visualization capabilities. One of 
its strengths is the ability to respect a characteristic length field for 
the generation of adapted meshes on lines, surfaces and volumes, and to 
mix these meshes with simple structured grids. 

Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and 
post-processing. The specification of any input to these modules is done 
either interactively using the graphical user interface or in ASCII text 
files using Gmsh's own scripting language.
