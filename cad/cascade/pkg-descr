Cascade is a program for analyzing the noise and distortion performance
of a cascade of elements in an electronic system. A typical application
of cascade is the analysis of a receiver. A text description of the
receiver block diagram consisting of things like amplifiers, mixers,
and filters is entered into cascade. Each element is characterized
by its gain and optionally noise figure, and third order intercept
point. The program then analyzes the system and produces a report
detailing the performance at each stage.

A summary is produced which shows the relative contributions to the
total system performance of each block. This allows easy identification
of what limits system performance.
