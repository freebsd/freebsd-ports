Gwave is a waveform viewer. Its purpose is for viewing analog data,
such as the output from Spice-like simulations.

Gwave can read binary or ascii files written by HSpice from transient,
AC, or Sweep analyses, "raw" files written by Spice2, Spice3, or
ngspice, and transient analysis files from the CAzM simulator. It can
also read a generic tabular ASCII format suitable for use with ACS or
homegrown tools.

It supports multiple "panels" (graticlules) with multiple variables
displayed in each. Two vertical-bar cursors are available for
time-difference measurements. Multiple files can be loaded, for
comparing the results of several simulations.

Much of Gwave's user interface is written in the Guile extension
language and is therefore easily extensible for custom applications
without recompilation.
