NASTRAN-95

NASTRAN is the NASA Structural Analysis System, a finite element analysis
(FEA) program completed in the early 1970's. It was the first of its kind
and opened the door to computer-aided engineering. Subsections of a design
can be modeled and then larger groupings of these elements can again be
modeled. NASTRAN can handle elastic stability analysis, complex
eigenvalues for vibration and dynamic stability analysis, dynamic response
for transient and steady state loads, and random excitation, and static
response to concentrated and distributed loads, thermal expansion, and
enforced deformations.
