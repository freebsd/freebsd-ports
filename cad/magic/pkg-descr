Magic is an interactive editor for VLSI layouts that runs under BSD.

To run magic, users should set CAD_HOME to the base installation directory
where magic was installed, e.g. /usr/local.  Alternatively, the system
administrator can create a dummy user named 'cad' with its home
directory set to the installation directory.
