Gdstk (GDSII Tool Kit) is a C++ library for creation and manipulation
of GDSII and OASIS files. It is also available as a Python module
meant to be a successor to Gdspy.

Key features for the creation of complex CAD layouts are included:
* Boolean operations on polygons (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
  based on clipping algorithm
* Polygon offset (inward and outward rescaling of polygons)
* Efficient point-in-polygon solutions for large array sets

Typical applications of Gdstk are in the fields of electronic chip design,
planar lightwave circuit design, and mechanical engineering.
