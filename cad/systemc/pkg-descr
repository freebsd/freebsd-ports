SystemC provides hardware-oriented constructs within the context of C++ 
as a class library implemented in standard C++.  Its use spans design and
verification from concept to implementation in hardware and software.

SystemC provides an interoperable modeling platform which enables the
development and exchange of very fast system-level C++ models. It also 
provides a  stable platform for development of system-level tools.
