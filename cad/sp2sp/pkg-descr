sp2sp ("spice to spice") is a processor of waveform data generated by
SPICE-type simulators.  It uses libspicefile library in Gwave which
provides SpiceStream and WaveFile avstraction levels.  sp2sp uses
SpiceStream to convert any file format supported by the SpiceStream
layer into one of several ASCII printable formats, and it is useful
for converting files any of the binary formats into a printable form,
where they can easily be processed by awk, perl, or some other scripting
language.
