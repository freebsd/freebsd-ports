Electric is a sophisticated electrical CAD system that can handle
many forms of circuit design, including:

   Custom IC layout (ASICs)
   Schematic drawing
   Hardware description language specifications
   Electro-mechanical hybrid layout

(snip, this is an edited version of Electric's homepage)

Electric handles these file formats:

   CIF I/O
   GDS I/O
   VHDL I/O
   DXF I/O
   PostScript, HPGL, and QuickDraw output

For real functionality, one should consider installing
support simulation software such as cad/spice.
