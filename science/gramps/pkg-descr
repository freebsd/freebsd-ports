GRAMPS (Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System)
is an open source genealogy program.
To put it shortly, it allows you to store, edit, and research genealogical 
data using your computer. Its functionality is somewhat common to other 
genealogical programs. However, GRAMPS offers some unique features.

It is written in Python, using the GTK/GNOME interface.
