Research, organize and share your family tree with GRAMPS
(Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System).
Gramps gives you the ability to record the many details of an
individual's life as well as the complex relationships between
various people, places and events. All of your research is kept
organized, searchable and as precise as you need it to be.

The Gramps project strives to produce a genealogy program that is
both intuitive for hobbyists and feature-complete for professional
genealogists. It is a community project, created, developed and
governed by genealogists.

It is written in Python, using a GTK3 interface.
