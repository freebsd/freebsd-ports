PYPHOT is a set of tools to compute synthetic photometry in a simple way, ideal
to integrate in larger projects.

The inputs are photonic or energetic response functions for the desired
photometric bands and stellar spectra. The modules are flexible to handle units
in the wavelength definition through a simplified version of pint.

Filters are represented individually by a Filter object. Collections of filters
are handled with a Library. We provide an internal library that contains a
signitificant amount of common filters.

Each filter is minimally defined by a wavelength and throughput. Many properties
such as central of pivot wavelength are computed internally.
