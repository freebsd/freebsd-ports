PyBrain is a modular Machine Learning Library for Python.
It's goal is to offer flexible, easy-to-use yet still powerful
algorithms for Machine Learning Tasks and a variety of
predefined environments to test and compare your algorithms.

PyBrain is short for Python-Based Reinforcement Learning,
Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network Library. In fact,
we came up with the name first and later reverse-engineerer
this quite descriptive "Backronym".
