PyQuante (Sourceforge Project Page) is an open-source suite of programs for
developing quantum chemistry methods. The program is written in the Python
programming language, but has many "rate-determining" modules also written
in C for speed. The resulting code, though not as fast as Jaguar, NWChem,
Gaussian, or MPQC, is much easier to understand and modify. The goal of this
software is not necessarily to provide a working quantum chemistry program
(although it will hopefully do that), but rather to provide a well-engineered
set of tools so that scientists can construct their own quantum chemistry
programs without going through the tedium of having to write every low-level
routine.
