SPAtial GrapHs: nETworks, Topology, & Inference

Spaghetti is an open-source Python library for the analysis of network-based
spatial data. Originating from the network module in PySAL (Python Spatial
Analysis Library), it is under active development for the inclusion of newly
proposed methods for building graph-theoretic networks and the analysis of
network events.
