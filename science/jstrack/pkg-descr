JStrack is written by and for people who are in areas that are
prone to hits from tropical systems (currently only in the Tropical
Atlantic). It's intended to display the NHC/TPC data and give you
what you need to make decisions, etc.. It does NOT, nor will it ever,
attempt to do any forecasting on its own---I leave that to the gurus
at the NHC/TPC.
