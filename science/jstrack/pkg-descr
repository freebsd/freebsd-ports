JStrack is written by and for people who are in areas that are prone to
hits from tropical systems (currently only in the Tropical Atlantic).
It's intended to display the NHC/TPC data and give you what you need to
make decisions, etc.  It does NOT, nor will it ever, attempt to do any
forecasting on its own -- I leave that to the gurus at the NHC/TPC.
