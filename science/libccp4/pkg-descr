CCP4 is a world-leading, integrated software suite for macromolecular
structure determination using X-ray crystallography and other biophysical
techniques. It provides a comprehensive collection of programs covering
all stages of the process, from data processing and phasing (e.g., Crank)
to molecular replacement (e.g., Beast, AMPLE), model building (e.g.,
Buccaneer), refinement (e.g., REFMAC), and validation.

The suite features automated structure solution pipelines and modern
graphical user interfaces like CCP4i2. As a community-based resource,
CCP4 supports a wide research community and plays a key role in the
education and training of scientists in experimental structural biology.
Its modular design and Coordinate Library offer flexibility and extensive
functionality for structural biologists.
