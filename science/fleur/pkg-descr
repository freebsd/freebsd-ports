The FLAPW-Method (Full Potential Linearized Augmented Plane Wave Method) is an
all-electron method which within density functional theory is universally
applicable to all atoms of the periodic table and to systems with compact
as well as open structures. It is widely considered to be the most precise
electronic structure method in solid state physics.
