GetDP is a general finite element solver using mixed elements to discretize
de Rham-type complexes in one, two and three dimensions.

The main feature of GetDP is the closeness between the input data defining
discrete problems (written by the user in ASCII data files) and the symbolic
mathematical expressions of these problems.
