TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using
data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while
the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors)
communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy
computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device
with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and
engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence
research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep
neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in
a wide variety of other domains as well.
