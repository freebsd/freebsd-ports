GRIBEX is an interface for encoding and decoding WMO FM-92 GRIB edition 1
messages and some ancillary subroutines for controlling printing and debugging.
The GRIBEX software was developed at the European Centre for Medium-range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and is part of the EMOS library. EMOS is mostly
written in Fortran. Therefore it has only a Fortran interface.

CGRIBEX is a lightweight version of GRIBEX written in ANSI C with a portable
Fortran interface. For best compatibility some of the C sources were converted
from the Fortran GRIBEX version.
