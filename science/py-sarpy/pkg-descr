SarPy is a basic Python library to read, write, and do simple processing of
complex SAR data using the NGA SICD format (standards linked below). It has been
released by NGA to encourage the use of SAR data standards throughout the
international SAR community. SarPy complements the SIX library (C++) and the
MATLAB SAR Toolbox, which are implemented in other languages but have similar
goals.
