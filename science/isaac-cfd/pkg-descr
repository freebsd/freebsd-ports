ISAAC (Integrated Solution Algorithm for Arbitrary Configurations) is a 
compressible Euler/Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics code. ISAAC 
includes the capability of calculating the Euler equations for inviscid 
flow or the Navier-Stokes equations for viscous flows. ISAAC uses a domain 
decomposition structure to accomodate complex physical configurations. 
ISAAC can calculate either steady-state or time dependent flow.

ISAAC was designed to test turbulence models. Various two equation 
turbulence models, explicit algebraic Reynolds stress models, and full 
differential Reynolds stress models are implemented in ISAAC. Several test 
cases are documented in the User's Guide.
