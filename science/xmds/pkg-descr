eXtensible multi-dimensional Simulator
    * An open-source XML based simulation package
    * From Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) up to stochastic Partial
      Differential Equations (PDEs)
    * Many applications:
          o physics
          o mathematics
          o engineering
          o finance
          o economics
          o chemistry
          o theoretical biology
    * Generates fast, C++ compiled code
    * Documentation and source are free!
    * Runs on Linux, Unix, MacOS X and Cygwin (Windows)
XMDS is a code generator that integrates equations. You write them down in
human readable form in an XML file, and it goes away and writes and compiles a
C++ program that integrates those equations as fast as it can possibly be done
in your architecture.
