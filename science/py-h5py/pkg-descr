The h5py package provides both a high- and low-level interface to the HDF5
library from Python. The low-level interface is intended to be a complete
wrapping of the HDF5 API, while the high-level component supports access to HDF5
files, datasets and groups using established Python and NumPy concepts.

A strong emphasis on automatic conversion between Python (Numpy) datatypes and
data structures and their HDF5 equivalents vastly simplifies the process of
reading and writing data from Python.
