Qiskit [quiss-kit] is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers
at the level of pulses, circuits, and application modules.

Qiskit Nature is one of Qiskit components. Qiskit Nature is an open-source
framework which supports solving quantum mechanical natural science problems
using quantum computing algorithms. This includes finding ground and excited
states of electronic and vibrational structure problems, measuring the dipole
moments of molecular systems, solving the Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models on
lattices, and much more.

The code comprises chemistry drivers, which when provided with a molecular
configuration will return one- and two-body integrals as well as other data that
is efficiently computed classically. This output data from a driver can then be
used as input in Qiskit Nature that contains logic which is able to translate
this into a form that is suitable for quantum algorithms.

For the solution of electronic structure problems, the problem Hamiltonian is
first expressed in the second quantization formalism, comprising fermionic
excitation and annihilation operators. These can then be mapped to the qubit
formalism using a variety of mappings such as Jordan-Wigner, Parity, and more,
in readiness for the quantum computation.
