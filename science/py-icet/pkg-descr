icet is a tool for the construction and sampling of alloy cluster expansions.

icet is written in Python, which allows easy integration with countless
first-principles codes and analysis tools accessible from Python, and allows
for a simple and intuitive user interface. All computationally demanding parts
are, however, written in C++ providing performance while maintaining
portability.
