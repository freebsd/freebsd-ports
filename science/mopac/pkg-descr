MOPAC (Molecular Orbital PACkage) is a powerful computational chemistry
software that employs semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods to study
molecular and periodic structures. Developed since 1981, it offers a
balance of computational speed and accuracy for a wide range of
applications in chemistry and materials science.

MOPAC implements various semi-empirical models, including AM1, PM3, PM6,
and PM7. It performs geometry optimization, transition-state optimization,
and vibrational analysis. Key features include solvation models (COSMO),
support for periodic boundary conditions, and the unique MOZYME solver
for rapid calculations on large systems, such as biomolecules and
materials. MOPAC also calculates gas-phase thermodynamics, molecular
polarizability, and integrates with numerous graphical user interfaces
and other chemistry software. It supports 83 elements of the periodic table.
