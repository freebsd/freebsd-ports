h5utils is a set of utilities for visualization and conversion of
scientific data in the free, portable HDF5 format.

Besides providing a simple tool for batch visualization as PNG images,
h5utils also includes programs to convert HDF5 datasets into the formats
required by other free visualization software (e.g. plain text, Vis5d,
and VTK).
