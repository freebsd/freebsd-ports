pycsw is an OGC CSW server implementation written in Python. Started in 2010
(more formally announced in 2011), pycsw allows for the publishing and discovery
of geospatial metadata via numerous APIs (CSW 2/CSW 3, OpenSearch, OAI-PMH,
SRU), providing a standards-based metadata and catalogue component of spatial
data infrastructures. pycsw is Open Source, released under an MIT license, and
runs on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).
