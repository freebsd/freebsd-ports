dimod is a part of the software stack for accessing quantum computing hardware
made by D-Wave company.

dimod is a shared API for samplers. It provides:
* classes for quadratic models - such as the binary quadratic model (BQM) class
  that contains Ising and QUBO models used by samplers such as the D-Wave system
  - and higher-order (non-quadratic) models
* reference examples of samplers and composed samplers
* abstract base classes for constructing new samplers and composed samplers
