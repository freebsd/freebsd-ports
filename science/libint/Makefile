# USE_GCC=yes is required because libint is used with mpqc which is built
# by gfortran48 (from `lang/gcc') and these two libraries each try to pull
# in a different version of libgcc_s.so which fails.  Forcing this port to
# build with lang/gcc as well resolves the conflict that manifests in
# `science/libghemical' port.
