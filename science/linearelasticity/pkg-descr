Elas, alias Elastic, is a simple yet efficient finite element solver for linear
elasticity problems in two and three dimensions.

A full description of all parameters and options that can be specified in the
command line or in a parameter file [file.elas] can be found in the project
wiki, see <https://github.com/ISCDtoolbox/LinearElasticity/wiki>.
