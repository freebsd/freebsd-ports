fresnel is a python library for path tracing publication quality
images of soft matter simulations in real time. The fastest render
performance is possible on NVIDIA GPUs using their OptiX ray tracing
engine. fresnel also supports multi-core CPUs using Intel's Embree ray
tracing kernels. Path tracing enables high quality global illumination
and advanced rendering effects controlled by intuitive parameters
(like roughness, specular, and metal).
