This computer program calculates static stability, high lift and control, and
dynamic derivative characteristics using the methods contained in the USAF
Stability and Control Datcom (Data Compendium). Configuration geometry,
attitude, and Mach range capabilities are consistent with those accommodated by
the Datcom. The program contains a trim option that computes control
deflections and aerodynamic increments for vehicle trim at subsonic Mach
numbers.

This project is a modified version of the publically released USAF aircraft
datcom. The goal of the project is to update the code and make it more usable
by the end user.
