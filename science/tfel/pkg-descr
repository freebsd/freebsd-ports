`MFront` is a code generator which translates a set of closely related
domain specific languages into plain C++ on top of the `TFEL`
library. Those languages covers three kind of material knowledge:

- material properties (for instance the
  Young modulus, the thermal conductivity, etc.)
- mechanical behaviours. Numerical performances of
  generated mechanical behaviours was given a particular
  attention. Various benchmarks shows that `MFront`
  implementations are competitive with native implementations
  available in the `Cast3M`, `Code-Aster` and `Cyrano3` solvers.
- simple point-wise models, such as material swelling
  used in fuel performance codes.

`MFront` comes with an handy easy-to-use tool called `MTest` that can
test the local behaviour of a material, by imposing independent
constraints on each component of the strain or the stress. This tool
has been much faster (from ten to several hundred times depending on
the test case) than using a full-fledged finite element solver.
