HofstadterTools (HT) is a set of Python programs and classes for analyzing the
Hofstadter model, which describes the behavior of non-interacting quantum
particles hopping on a lattice coupled to a gauge field. This package can be
used to compute the band structure of a generalized Hofstadter model on any
regular Euclidean lattice, as well as its key properties, such as quantum
geometry and topology.
