dwave-greedy is an implementation of a steepest descent solver for binary
quadratic models.

Steepest descent is the discrete analogue of gradient descent, but the best move
is computed using a local minimization rather rather than computing a gradient.
At each step, we determine the dimension along which to descend based on the
highest energy drop caused by a variable flip.
