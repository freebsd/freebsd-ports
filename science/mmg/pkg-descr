Mmg is an open source software for simplicial remeshing. It provides 3
applications and 4 libraries:

- the mmg2d application and the libmmg2d library: adaptation and optimization of
  a two-dimensional triangulation and generation of a triangulation from a set
  of points or from given boundary edges;

- the mmgs application and the libmmgs library: adaptation and optimization of a
  surface triangulation and isovalue discretization;

- the mmg3d application and the libmmg3d library: adaptation and optimization of
  a tetrahedral mesh and implicit domain meshing;

- the libmmg library gathering the libmmg2d, libmmgs and libmmg3d libraries.
