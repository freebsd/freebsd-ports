Machine Learning PY (mlpy) is a high-performance Python package for
predictive modeling. It makes extensive use of numpy (http://scipy.org)
to provide fast N-dimensional array manipulation and easy integration of
C code. mlpy provides high level procedures that support, with few lines
of code, the design of rich Data Analysis Protocols (DAPs) for
preprocessing, clustering, predictive classification and feature
selection. Methods are available for feature weighting and ranking, data
resampling, error evaluation and experiment landscaping.The package
includes tools to measure stability in sets of ranked feature lists.
