You installed BOUT++, plasma fluid finite-difference simulation code.

BOUT++ is a framework that allows to solve a variety of partial differential
equations, with or without physical meaning.

You can use BOUT++ in one of these ways:
1. Build with included examples: make WITH_EXAMPLES=yes
   These examples showcase what BOUT++ can do on simple PDE systems,
2. Build and run any of the dependent ports: science/bout++-*
3. Write your own BOUT++ applications solving your equations.
