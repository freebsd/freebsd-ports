DFTD4 provides a generally applicable, charge-dependent London-dispersion
correction for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and other
atomistic modeling methods. It addresses the missing van-der-Waals (vdW)
interactions from standard exchange-correlation functionals by approximating
them based solely on the system's structure, enabling rapid computation.

This software can be linked as an external package to various DFT codes,
such as VASP, to add vdW energies, forces, and stresses for structure
relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations. It features functional-specific
parameters for numerous density functionals and offers API support for
Fortran, C, and Python, making it a versatile tool for computational
chemistry and physics.
