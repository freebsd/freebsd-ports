HOOMD-blue is a general-purpose particle simulation toolkit,
implementing molecular dynamics and hard particle Monte Carlo
optimized for fast execution on both GPUs and CPUs. As a Python
package, HOOMD-blue gives you the flexibility to create custom
initialization routines, control simulation parameters, perform in
situ analysis, use interactive notebooks, and more.
