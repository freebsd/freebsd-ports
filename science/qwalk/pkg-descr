QWalk is a high-accuracy quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) program designed for
electronic structure calculations in molecules and solids. It serves as a
research vehicle for developing new algorithms and methods, capable of
scaling up to large system sizes and finding very accurate solutions to
the stationary Schrodinger equation for atoms, molecules, solids, and
various model systems.

Its primary application lies in computational condensed-matter physics
and chemistry, particularly for studying correlated electron systems and
determining both ground-state and excited-state properties of quantum
systems. QWalk provides a robust platform for advanced research in
quantum chemistry and materials science.
