McXtrace - Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations of X-ray experiments.

McXtrace is a tool for simulating X-ray instrumentation and experiments
using a ray-tracing formalism. Currently the main use of McXtrace
is in the field of synchrotron beamline instrumentation design, but
various other uses have been found, for instance for designing X-ray
telescopes or for laboratory sources.

This port contains the McXtrace component library.
