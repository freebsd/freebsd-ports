This is Schrodinger, Inc's 2D coordinate generation. The emphasis of these
algorithms are on quality of 2D coordinates rather than speed of generation.
The algorithm distinguishes itself from many others by doing well with both
macrocycles and metal complexes. It also does extremely well on typical
drug-like small molecules, and has been validated on millions of compounds.
