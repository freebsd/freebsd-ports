Gabedit is a Graphical User Interface for FireFly (PC-Gamess), Gamess-US,
Gaussian, Molcas, Molpro, MPQC, NWChem, OpenMopac, Orca, PSI4 and Q-Chem
computational chemistry packages.

Features:
* Gabedit makes using Computational Chemistry Packages (CCP) simple and
  straightforward .
* Sketch in molecules using its advanced 3D Structure Builder, or load in
  molecules from standard files.
* Set up and submit CCP jobs right from the interface, and monitor their
  progress as they run.
* Examine calculation results graphically via state-of-the-art visualization
  features: display molecular orbitals and other surfaces, view spectra, animate
  normal modes, geometry optimizations and reaction paths.
* Molecular Dynamics using Amber 99 molecular mechanics or Semi-Empirical
  potentials.
