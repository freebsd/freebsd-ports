Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of open-source computer codes
for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale.
It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials.

Quantum ESPRESSO has evolved into a distribution of independent and
inter-operable codes in the spirit of an open-source project. The Quantum
ESPRESSO distribution consists of a "historical" core set of components, and
a set of plug-ins that perform more advanced tasks, plus a number of third-party
packages designed to be inter-operable with the core components. Researchers
active in the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to
participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by implementing
their own ideas into existing codes.
