MSMS computes, for a given probe radius, the reduced surface of a set of
spheres. An analytical description of the solvent excluded surface is
computed from the reduced surface. Special attention is paid to the proper
handling of self-intersecting parts of the surface called singularities.
This analytical model of the solvent excluded surface can be triangulated
with a user specified vertex density.
