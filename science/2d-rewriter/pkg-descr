2d-rewriter is a cellular automata simulator. Key features:
- Declarative input language for rules and initial patterns definition.
- Ability to emulate Conway's "Life Game" via proper rules specification.
- Ability to demonstrate self replicating loops.
- Patterns are tried in 4 orientations.
- Cell directions are defined against the pattern orientation.
- Total number of rules can be substantially decreased by using
sets and defining patterns using variables.
- Required run time environment is a minimal X window system installation
on a POSIX-compatible system (*BSD/Linux/Mac OS X/Cygwin/...).
