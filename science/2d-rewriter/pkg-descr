2d-rewriter is a cellular automata simulator.

               Key features

Declarative input language for rules and initial patterns definition.

Ability to emulate Conway's "Life Game" via proper rules specification.

Ability to demonstrate self replicating loops.

Patterns are tried in 4 orientations.

Cell directions are defined against the pattern orientation.

Total number of rules can be substantially decreased by using
sets and defining patterns using variables.

Required run time environment is a minimal X window system installation
on a POSIX-compatible system (*BSD/Linux/Mac OS X/Cygwin/...).
