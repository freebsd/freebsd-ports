This software calculates phonon-phonon interaction and related properties using
the supercell approach. For example, the following physical properties are
obtained:
* Lattice thermal conductivity (RTA and direct solution of LBTE)
* Phonon lifetime/linewidth
* Imaginary part of self energy
* Joint density of states (JDOS) and weighted-JDOS
