OPSIN (Open Parser for Systematic IUPAC Nomenclature) is a freely
available, open-source Java library designed to accurately interpret
systematic IUPAC chemical nomenclature and convert it into chemical
structures. It offers high precision and recall for organic chemical
names, including complex heterocycles and stereochemistry.

OPSIN supports multiple output formats such as SMILES, InChI, and CML,
and can also generate PNG, SVG, and JSON. It can be deployed as a web
service, a local command-line application for bulk conversion, or
integrated into other systems via third-party Python libraries. Its
extensible design and robust parsing mechanism make it a valuable tool
for chemical information extraction from scientific literature and
patents, research and development, and populating chemical databases.
