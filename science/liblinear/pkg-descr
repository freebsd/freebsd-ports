LIBLINEAR is a linear classifier for data with millions of instances and
features. It supports L2-regularized classifiers (L2-loss linear SVM,
L1-loss linear SVM, and logistic regression), L1-regularized classifiers
(L2-loss linear SVM and logistic regression).

Main features of LIBLINEAR include

- Same data format as LIBSVM and similar usage
- One-vs-the rest and Crammer & Singer multi-class classification
- Cross validation for model selection
- Probability estimates (logistic regression only)
- Weights for unbalanced data
