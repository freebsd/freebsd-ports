Code_Saturne is EDF's general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
software.

The basic capabilities of Code_Saturne enable the handling of either
incompressible or expandable flows with or without heat transfer and turbulence.
Dedicated modules are available for specific physics such as radiative heat
transfer, combustion (gas, coal, heavy fuel oil, ...), magneto-hydrodynamics,
compressible flows, two-phase flows (Euler-Lagrange approach with two-way
coupling), or atmospheric flows.
