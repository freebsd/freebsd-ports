NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is an interface for array-oriented data access
and a library that provides an implementation of the interface. The netCDF
library also defines a machine-independent format for representing scientific
data. Together, the interface, library, and format support the creation, access,
and sharing of scientific data. The netCDF software was developed at the Unidata
Program Center in Boulder, Colorado.
