An all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-plane wave (LAPW) code with
many advanced features. Written originally at Karl-Franzens-Universitat Graz as
a milestone of the EXCITING EU Research and Training Network, the code is
designed to be as simple as possible so that new developments in the field of
density functional theory (DFT) can be added quickly and reliably.
