SeeK-path is a python module to obtain band paths in the Brillouin zone
of crystal structures.

The definition of k-point labels follows crystallographic convention, as defined
and discussed in the HPKOT paper. Moreover, the Bravais lattice is detected
properly using the spacegroup symmetry. Also, the suggested band path provided
in the HPKOT paper is returned. Systems without time-reversal and
inversion-symmetry are also properly taken into account.
