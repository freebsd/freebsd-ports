Kalzium is your digital replacement for the periodic table on paper.
It is a program that visualizes the periodic table of elements (PSE)
and includes basic information about all common elements in the PSE.
It has gained much more functions over time.

FEATURES
- Versatile overview of all important data from the elements like
  melting points, electron affinity, electron negativity, electron
  configuration, radii, mass, ionisation energy.
- Tool to visualize the spectral lines of each element.
- Different colored views for the PSE: separation of the different
  blocks, year simulator, temperature simulator.
- Molecular weight calculator.
- An isotope table.
- 3D molecule editor, with a load and save functionality.
- An equation solver for stoichiometric problems.
- Filetype conversion for different types of chemical programs.
- Tool to produce a comprehesive list of all risk and safety
  statements.
