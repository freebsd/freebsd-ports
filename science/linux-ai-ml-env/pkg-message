To utilize CUDA support for PyTorch, both https://github.com/shkhln 's
compatibility library preloading and Linux compatibility layer usage are
required, as demonstrated in the provided demonstration scripts.

To play with Stable Diffusion copy it to a user-writable directory, edit at will
and launch it via ai-ml-env-python:

	cp /usr/local/share/ai-ml-env/stable-diffusion-sample.py ~/
	ai-ml-env-python ~/stable-diffusion-sample.py

This will download data packages into ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/ during the
first-time run.

The port also provides Pytorch examples from the official GitHub repository.
To run and modify these examples, copy them to a user-writable directory
and then launch the entry point script via ai-ml-env-bash:

	cp -r /usr/local/share/ai-ml-env/pytorch-examples ~/pytorch-examples
	cd ~/pytorch-examples && ai-ml-env-bash ./run_python_examples.sh

You can then run

ai-ml-env-bash ./run_python_examples.sh clean

to remove downloaded data or just remove the whole directory to clean up
everything.
