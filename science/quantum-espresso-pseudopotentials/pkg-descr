quantum-espresso-pseudopotentials contains pseudopotentials that are
normally needed in order to run quantum chemistry computations in
the Quantum Espresso suite.

Quantum Espresso is an integrated suite of open-source computer codes
for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale.
It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials.
