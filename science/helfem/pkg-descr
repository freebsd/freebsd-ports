HelFEM is a suite of programs for finite element calculations on atoms and
diatomic molecules at the Hartree-Fock or density-functional levels of theory.
Hundreds of functionals at the local spin density approximation (LDA),
generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and meta-GGA levels of theory are
supported.
