Parthenon is a performance portable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement
framework.

Key Features:
* Device first/device resident approach (work data only in device memory to
  prevent expensive transfers between host and device)
* Transparent packing of data across blocks (to reduce/hide kernel launch
  latency)
* Direct device-to-device communication via asynchronous MPI communication
* Intermediate abstraction layer to hide complexity of device kernel launches
* Flexible, plug-in package system
* Abstract variables controlled via metadata flags
* Support for particles
* Support for cell-, node-, face-, and edge-centered fields
* Multi-stage drivers/integrators with support for task-based parallelism
