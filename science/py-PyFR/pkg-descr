PyFR is an open-source Python based framework for solving advection-diffusion
type problems on streaming architectures using the Flux Reconstruction approach
of Huynh. The framework is designed to solve a range of governing systems on
mixed unstructured grids containing various element types. It is also designed
to target a range of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific
language derived from the Mako templating engine. The current release has the
following capabilities:
* Governing Equations - Euler, Navier Stokes
* Dimensionality - 2D, 3D
* Element Types - Triangles, Quadrilaterals, Hexahedra, Prisms, Tetrahedra,
  Pyramids
* Platforms - CPU Clusters, Nvidia GPU Clusters, AMD GPU Clusters, Intel Xeon
  Phi Clusters
* Spatial Discretisation - High-Order Flux Reconstruction
* Temporal Discretisation - Explicit and Implicit (via Dual Time-Stepping)
* Precision - Single, Double
* Mesh Files Imported - Gmsh (.msh), CGNS (.cgns)
* Solution Files Exported - Unstructured VTK (.vtu, .pvtu)
