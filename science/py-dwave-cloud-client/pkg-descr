D-Wave Cloud Client is a minimal implementation of the REST interface used to
communicate with D-Wave Sampler API (SAPI) servers.

SAPI is an application layer built to provide resource discovery, permissions,
and scheduling for quantum annealing resources at D-Wave Systems. This package
provides a minimal Python interface to that layer without compromising the
quality of interactions and workflow.
