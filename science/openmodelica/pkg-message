You installed OpenModelica: a modeling and simulation environment.

The first program to run is OMEdit.

In OMEdit you need to:
- go to the File/Manage Libraries menu item and install the 'Modelica' library
- go to the File/System Libraries and enable several libraries under it

This should make several library items appear in the left pane in OMEdit.
