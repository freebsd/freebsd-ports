McStas perl tools to aid in running neutron ray tracing simulations.

McStas is a tool for simulating neutron instrumentation and experiments using
a ray-tracing formalism. Currently the main use of McStas is in the field of
instrumentation design.

This port contains a few perl-based helper tools (including a GUI) to aid the
user in setting up and running simulations. The tools are:
mcgui: A Tk/Perl based GUI.
mcrun: A Script that makes it easy to run sims and perform
  point scans and simple optimizations.
mcdoc: Script for viewing inline component documentation.
mcplot: Tool for plotting McXtrace-generated results.
mcdisplay: Visual ray-tracing displaying neutron trajectories.
mcformatgui: Front-end to mxformat to help reformat data-files (obsolescent).
mcdaemon: Deamon to dynamically monitor and plot results (obsolescent).
mcstas2vitess: Tool to transfer a McStas simulation to ViTESS.
mcresplot: Script to help plotting resolution functions.
