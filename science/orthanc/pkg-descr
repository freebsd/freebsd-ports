Orthanc aims at providing a simple, yet powerful standalone DICOM
server. It is designed to improve the DICOM flows in hospitals and to
support research about the automated analysis of medical images.

Orthanc can turn any computer running Windows, Linux, FreeBSD or OS X
into a DICOM store (in other words, a mini-PACS system). Its
architecture is lightweight and standalone, meaning that no complex
database administration is required, nor the installation of third-party
dependencies.

What makes Orthanc unique is the fact that it provides a RESTful API.
Thanks to this major feature, it is possible to drive Orthanc from any
computer language. The DICOM tags of the stored medical images can be
downloaded in the JSON file format. Furthermore, standard PNG images can
be generated on-the-fly from the DICOM instances by Orthanc.

Orthanc lets its users focus on the content of the DICOM files, hiding
the complexity of the DICOM format and of the DICOM protocol.
