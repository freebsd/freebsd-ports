PySAL, the Python spatial analysis library, is an open source cross-platform
library for geospatial data science with an emphasis on geospatial vector data
written in Python. It supports the development of high level applications for
spatial analysis, such as
- detection of spatial clusters, hot-spots, and outliers
- construction of graphs from spatial data
- spatial regression and statistical modeling on geographically embedded
  networks
- spatial econometrics
- exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis
