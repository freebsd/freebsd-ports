Ocean software provides a variety of quantum, classical, and quantum-classical
dimod samplers that run either remotely (for example, in D-Wave's Leap
environment) or locally on your CPU.

dwave-samplers implements the following classical algorithms for solving binary
quadratic models (BQM):
* Random: a sampler that draws uniform random samples.
* Simulated Annealing: a probabilistic heuristic for optimization and
  approximate Boltzmann sampling well suited to finding good solutions of large
  problems.
* Steepest Descent: a discrete analogue of gradient descent, often used in
  machine learning, that quickly finds a local minimum.
* Tabu: a heuristic that employs local search with methods to escape local
  minima.
* Tree Decomposition: an exact solver for problems with low treewidth.
