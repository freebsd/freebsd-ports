A set of script files named `definitions.<shell-type>' should now
exist in the `bin' directory.
`<shell-type>' specifies the type of shell (command interpreter)
for which the script file was written: `C' (C-shell style), `K'
(Korn shell style),  or `B' (Bourne shell style).  They are script
files that a user would execute to set up the environment variables
and aliases (where supported) necessary to use CDF.
A user would then execute the appropriate script file to define
aliases for the toolkit programs and environment variables for
the locations of the include files, CDF library, etc.

For the Korn, BASH, and POSIX shells, the following command
would be used:

       . %%PREFIX%%/bin/definitions.K

For the Bourne shell, the following command would be used:

       . %%PREFIX%%/bin/definitions.B

For the C and `tcsh' shells, the following command would be
used:

       source %%PREFIX%%/bin/definitions.C

Because aliases are not available when using the Bourne shell,
the toolkit programs must be invoked by specifying the actual
name of the executable file.  The script file `definitions.B'
describes how to do this.
