OpenFermion is an open source effort for compiling and analyzing quantum
algorithms to simulate fermionic systems, including quantum chemistry.
Among other functionalities, the current version features data structures
and tools for obtaining and manipulating representations of fermionic and
qubit Hamiltonians.
