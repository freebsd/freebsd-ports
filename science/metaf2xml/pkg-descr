metaf2xml can download, parse and decode aviation routine weather reports
(METAR, SPECI, SAO), aerodrome forecasts (TAF), synoptic observations
(SYNOP), observations from buoys (BUOY) and meteorological reports from
aircrafts (AMDAR). Data can also be taken from decoded BUFR messages.
The extracted data can be written as XML or passed to a user-defined
function (all done in Perl).

It also provides XSLT style sheets to convert the XML to plain language
(text, HTML), or XML with different schemas. A web-based (CGI) user
interface can be used to download and display up-to-date weather data from
NOAA, Ogimet, and other sources.
