metaf2xml can download, parse and decode aviation routine weather
reports (METAR, SPECI, SAO), aerodrome forecasts (TAF), synoptic
observations (SYNOP), observations from buoys (BUOY) and
meteorological reports from aircrafts (AMDAR). The extracted data can
be written as XML or passed to a user-defined function (all done in
Perl).

It also provides XSLT style sheets to convert the XML to plain
language (text, HTML), or XML with different schemas. A web-based
(CGI) user interface can be used to download and display up-to-date
weather data from NOAA, Ogimet, and other sources.
