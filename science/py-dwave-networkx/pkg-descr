D-Wave NetworkX is an extension of NetworkX - a Python language package for
exploration and analysis of networks and network algorithms - for users of
D-Wave Systems. It provides tools for working with Chimera graphs and
implementations of graph-theory algorithms on the D-Wave system and other
binary quadratic model samplers.
