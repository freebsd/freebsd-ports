GTAMS Analyzer is a complete coding and analysis package. It is a "port" of
TAMS Analyzer for Macintosh OS X. Note, at some point the two projects will
have identical file formats, at which point  the initial G (for GNUstep)
will be dropped. GTAMS stands for GNUstep Text Analysis Markup System, it
is a convention for identifying themes in text. The software offers a wide
range of tools for applying themes to texts and identifying patterns of
themes within and between texts.
