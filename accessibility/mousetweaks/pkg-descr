The Mousetweaks package provides mouse accessibility enhancements for the
GNOME desktop.

These enhancements are:

1. It offers a way to perform the various clicks without using any
hardware button.

2. It allows users to perform a right click by doing a click&hold of the
left mouse button. (For a left-handed mouse user, the terms left and right
have to be inverted.)

3. It provides an applet that the user can install on a panel. This applet
creates an area on the panel into which the pointer can be captured until
the user releases it with a predefined button and modifier combination.
