As with the Qt 5 version, Qt Speech provides application developers with a
QObject subclass, QTextToSpeech, that provides an interface to the platform's
speech synthesizer engine; and a value type QVoice that encapsulates voice
characteristics. With those classes, applications can make themselves more
accessible to users, and go beyond the screen-reader functionality of assistive
technologies. Using non-visual channels to inform users about changes or events
can be very useful in hands-free situations, such as turn-by-turn navigation
systems. Content-focused applications like ebook readers could benefit from
text-to-speech synthesis without depending on assistive technology.
