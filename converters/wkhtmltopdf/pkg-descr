wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage are powerful utilities to convert HTML to PDF
or an image file using a patched static build of Qt and the webkit rendering
engine.

A webpage can be downloaded directly from the web and rendered into a PDF
document or an image file (multiple formats are supported).

Features of the static version:
* Convert web pages into PDF documents (or images) using webkit
* Adding headers and footers
* TOC generation
* Batch mode conversions
* XServer is not required (however the X11 client libs must be installed)

For proper functionality you may need to install the following port(s):
x11-fonts/webfonts
