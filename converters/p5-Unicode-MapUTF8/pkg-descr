Unicode::MapUTF8
----------------

Provides an adapter layer between core routines for converting
to and from UTF8 and other encodings. In essence, a way to give
multiple existing Unicode modules a single common interface so
you don't have to know the underlaying implementations to do
simple UTF8 to-from other character set string conversions.
As such, it wraps the Unicode::String, Unicode::Map8,
Unicode::Map and Jcode modules in a standardized and simple
API.
