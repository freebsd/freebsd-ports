This library implements an efficient, compact-output, and feature-rich
serializer using a binary protocol called Sereal.  Its sister module
Sereal::Decoder (converts/p5-Sereal-Decoder) implements a decoder for
this format.  The two are released separately to allow for independent
and safer upgrading.
