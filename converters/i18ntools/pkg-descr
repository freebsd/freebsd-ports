Tools for the conversion to and from UTF-8 Unicode encoding. Note that
RFC-2277 mandates that all "protocols" MUST handle UTF-8 properly.

	- utrans converts text files created using any 8-bit character
	  map into UTF-8;

	- uhtrans converts UTF-8 files into 7-bit ASCII with anything
	  else formatted as an HTML-style tags, e.g. &#1234; (decimal);

	- hutrans converts 7-bit ASCII files with HTML-style tags, to UTF-8,
	  thus complementing the functionality of hutrans;

	- ptrans converts UTF-8 files into 8-bit text using any
	  8-bit character map, thus complementing utrans.

Additionally, tuc is installed if not found. Tuc converts text files
between the DOS/Windows and the Unix formats.

This port depends on ports/converters/libutf-8.
