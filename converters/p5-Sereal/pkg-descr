Sereal is an efficient, compact-output, binary and feature-rich
serialization protocol.  The Perl encoder is implemented as the
Sereal::Encoder module, the Perl decoder correspondingly as
Sereal::Decoder.  They are distributed separately to allow for safe
upgrading without downtime.

The encoder and decoder modules are available as these two ports:
  - converters/p5-Sereal-Encoder
  - converters/p5-Sereal-Decoder

This port will install both of them.
