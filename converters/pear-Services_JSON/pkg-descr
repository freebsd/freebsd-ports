JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, http://json.org) is a lightweight
data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is
easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the
JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December
1999.JSON is a text format that is completely language independent
but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of
languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, TCL, and many
others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

This package provides a simple encoder and decoder for JSON notation. It
is intended for use with client-side Javascript applications that make
use of HTTPRequest to perform server communication functions - data can
be encoded into JSON notation for use in a client-side javascript, or
decoded from incoming Javascript requests. JSON format is native to
Javascript,and can be directly eval()'ed with no further parsing overhead.
