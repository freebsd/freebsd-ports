Svglib is a pure-Python library for reading SVG files and converting them (to a
reasonable degree) to other formats using the ReportLab Open Source toolkit.

Used as a package you can read existing SVG files and convert them into
ReportLab Drawing objects that can be used in a variety of contexts, e.g. as
ReportLab Platypus Flowable objects or in RML.

As a command-line tool it converts SVG files into PDF ones (but adding other
output formats like bitmap or EPS is really easy and will be better supported,
soon).
