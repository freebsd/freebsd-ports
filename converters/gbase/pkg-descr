GBase is a GTK program designed to convert between the four common
bases used in programming (decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary).
It converts numbers on-the-fly as they are typed in. It can also
convert numbers entered on the command line. It can correctly handle
both signed and unsigned 32-bit integers.
