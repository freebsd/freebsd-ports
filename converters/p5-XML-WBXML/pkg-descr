This module is a wrapper around Aymerick Jehanne's libwbxml (or perhaps
libwbxml2, I am not sure what the distinction is) library for handling
Wireless Binary XML. You must install libwbxml2 prior to installing this
module. The library can be found at http://libwbxml.aymerick.com/
(libwbxml2 itself requires the expat library to be installed.)

The module defines two functions: xml_to_wbxml and wbxml_to_xml.
