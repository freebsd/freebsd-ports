JSON::Tiny is a standalone adaptation of Mojo::JSON, from the Mojolicious
framework. It has been adapted as a single-source-file module of under 350 lines
of code and core-only dependencies.

Key features include relaxed JSON handling, transparent Unicode support, speed,
small memory footprint, and a minimal code base ideal for bundling or inlining.

Mojo::JSON was chosen as a model because it is robust, minimal, and well tested.
Mojo::JSON's tests were also adapted to a design free of non-core dependencies.
