This program decodes those annoying application/ms-tnef MIME
attachments that Microsoft mail servers helpfully use to encapsulate
your already MIME encoded attachments.

Due to the proliferation of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange mail
servers, more and more mail is encapsulated into this format.

The YTNEF program allows one to unpack the attachments which were
encapsulated into the YTNEF attachment. Thus alleviating the need to
use Microsoft Outlook to view them.

Now supports winmail.dat Outlook files
