This library implements a deserializer for an efficient,
compact-output, and feature-rich binary protocol called Sereal. Its
sister module Sereal::Encoder (converters/p5-Sereal-Encoder) implements
an encoder for this format. The two are released separately to allow for
independent and safer upgrading.
