dumpasn1 is an ASN.1 parser which dumps the contents of an ASN.1-encoded
file, as well as interpreting the OIDs contained in the file into
human-readable format. Dumpasn1 is intended for examining the contents
of PKI certificates and comes with a full list of security-related OIDs,
but can be easily extended to parse other OIDs as well.
