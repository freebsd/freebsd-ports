Boulder IO is a simple TAG=VALUE data format designed for sharing
data between programs connected via a pipe.  It is also simple
enough to use as a common data exchange format between databases,
Web pages, and other data representations.

The basic data format is very simple.  It consists of a series of
TAG=VALUE pairs separated by newlines.  It is record-oriented.
The end of a record is indicated by an empty delimiter alone on a
line.  The delimiter is "=" by default, but can be adjusted by the
user.
