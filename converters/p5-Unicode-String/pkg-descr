These are experimental modules to handle various Unicode issues.  They
were made before perl included native UTF8 support.

The current set of modules are:

  Unicode::String   - represent strings of Unicode chars
  Unicode::CharName - look up character names
  Unicode::Map8     - mapping tables towards 8-bit char sets

(the Unicode::Map8 module is distributed separately)
