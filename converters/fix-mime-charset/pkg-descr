Fix-mime-charset automatically detects character sets of email message and 
modifies the Content-Type header appropriately. It can be used as mail 
filter in mailing lists where users often set the charset of their messages
incorrectly. It processes messages fast and accurately, ignoring 
attachments, and correctly interprets transfer-encodings. None but the 
Content-Type header is changed.
