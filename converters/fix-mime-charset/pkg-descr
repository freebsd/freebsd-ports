Fix-mime-charset automatically detects character sets of email message and
modifies the Content-Type header appropriately. It can be used as mail
filter in mailing lists where users often set the charset of their messages
incorrectly. It processes messages fast and accurately, ignoring
attachments, and correctly interprets transfer-encodings. None but the
Content-Type header is changed.
