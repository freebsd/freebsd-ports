This simple tool reads a source file with TASM syntax and converts it
to AT&T syntax.

The AT&T syntax is widely used by GNU tools, in particular the GAS(AS)
interpreter and GCC compiler.

The TASM syntax is used by many commercial compilers and disassemblers,
ie. NASM, MASM, Visual Studio or IDA Pro.

Ta2As can automate most of the conversion, but it still isn't perfect
- some correction have to be made manually before the code compiles.

This tool was originally written by Frank van Dijk and released by
SPiRiT group; this is continuation of his work, although not much of
the original code remains.
