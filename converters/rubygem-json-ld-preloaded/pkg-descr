This gem uses the preloading capabilities in JSON::LD::Context to create ruby
context definitions for common JSON-LD contexts to dramatically reduce
processing time when any preloaded context is used in a JSON-LD document. As a
consequence, changes made to these contexts after the gem release will not be
loaded.
