Unicode::Map8                                                                  
-------------                                                                  
                                                                               
The Unicode::Map8 class implement efficient mapping tables between             
8-bit character sets and 16 bit character sets like Unicode.  About            
170 different mapping tables between various known character sets and          
Unicode is distributed with this package.  The source of these tables          
is the vendor mapping tables provided by Unicode, Inc. and the code            
tables in RFC 1345.  New maps can easily be installed.                         
                                                                               
By coincidence Martin Schwartz created a similar module at the same            
time I did.  His module is called Unicode::Map and should be available         
on CPAN too.  Both modules now support a unified interface.  Martin's          
module will be depreciated in the future.                                      
                                                                               
Since UTF8 support is coming to Perl soon, there might be good reasons
to move this module in the direction of mapping to/from UTF8.  I will
probably do so, once the Unicode support in the Perl core settle.
