This is the library needed to YTNEF aaplication

This program decodes those annoying application/ms-tnef MIME attachments that
Microsoft mail servers helpfully use to encapsulate your already MIME encoded
attachments.

Due to the proliferation of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange mail servers,
more and more mail is encapsulated into this format.

The YTNEF program allows one to unpack the attachments which were encapsulated
into the YTNEF attachment.  Thus alleviating the need to use Microsoft Outlook
to view them.

Now supports winmail.dat Outlook files
