A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and
the web. Started out as a fork of RJSONIO, but has been completely
rewritten in recent versions. The package offers flexible, robust,
high performance tools for working with JSON in R and is particularly
powerful for building pipelines and interacting with web APIs. The
implementation is based on the mapping described in the vignette
of the package (Ooms, 2014). In addition to drop-in replacements
for toJSON and fromJSON, jsonlite contains functions to stream,
validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with the
package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded consistently
for use with dynamic data in systems and applications.
