Unicode::MAP
------------

This module converts strings from and to 2-byte Unicode UCS2 format.
All mappings happen via 2 byte UTF16 encodings, not via 1 byte UTF8
encoding. To convert between UTF8 and UTF16 use Unicode::String.

For historical reasons this module coexists with Unicode::Map8.
Please use Unicode::Map8 unless you need to care for >1 byte character
sets, e.g. chinese GB2312. Anyway, if you stick to the basic
functionality (see documentation) you can use both modules equivalently.

Practically this module will disappear from earth sooner or later as
Unicode mapping support needs somehow to get into perl's core. If you
like to work on this field please don't hesitate contacting Gisle Aas
and check out the mailing list perl-unicode!
