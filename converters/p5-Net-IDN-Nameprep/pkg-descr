This module implements the nameprep specification, which describes how
to prepare internationalized domain name (IDN) labels in order to
increase the likelihood that name input and name comparison work in
ways that make sense for typical users throughout the world.  Nameprep
is a profile of the stringprep protocol and is used as part of a suite
of on-the-wire protocols for internationalizing the Domain Name System
(DNS).
