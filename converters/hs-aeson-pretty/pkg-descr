A JSON pretty-printing library compatible with aeson as well as a
command-line tool to improve readabilty of streams of JSON data.  The
/library/ provides the function "encodePretty".  It is a drop-in
replacement for aeson's "encode" function, producing JSON-ByteStrings
for human readers.  The /command-line tool/ reads JSON from stdin and
writes prettified JSON to stdout.  It also offers a complementary
"compact"-mode, essentially the opposite of pretty-printing.
