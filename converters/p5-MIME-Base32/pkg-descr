This package contains a base32 encoder/decoder.
These encoding methods are specified in RFC 3548 -
The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings.

The base32 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary
sequences of octets in a form that need not be humanly
readable. A 33-character subset ([A-Z2-7=]) of US-ASCII
is used, enabling 5 bits to be represented per printable
character.
