This module converts Perl data structures to JSON and vice versa.
Its primary goal is to be correct and its secondary goal is to be fast.
To reach the latter goal it was written in C.

As this is the n-th-something JSON module on CPAN, what was the reason
to write yet another JSON module? While it seems there are many JSON
modules, none of them correctly handle all corner cases, and in most
cases their maintainers are unresponsive, gone missing, or not listening
to bug reports for other reasons.
