This module implements the stringprep framework for preparing
Unicode text strings in order to increase the likelihood that
string input and string comparison work in ways that make sense
for typical users throughout the world.  The stringprep protocol
is useful for protocol identifier values, company and personal
names, internationalized domain names, and other text strings.

The stringprep framework does not specify how protocols should
prepare text strings. Protocols must create profiles of
stringprep in order to fully specify the processing options.
