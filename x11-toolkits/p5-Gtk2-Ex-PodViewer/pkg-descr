Gtk2::PodViewer is a widget for rendering Perl POD documents.
It is based on the Gtk2::TextView widget and uses Pod::Parser
for manipulating POD data.

Also, podviewer provides a simple and attractive way to read
Perl's POD documentation. You can use it to read the Perl POD
pages, module documentation and information about Perl's
builtin functions.
