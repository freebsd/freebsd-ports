The Tile Widget Set is a next-generation re-implementation of many of the core
Tk widgets, along with the addition of several new widgets. With Tile, Tk
applications can achieve an appearance much closer to native platform widgets,
as well as take advantage of a modern, highly dynamic theme engine to produce a
wide variety of alternative user interface styles. Tile widgets complement the
existing Tk widgets, and Tile is currently being incorporated directly into Tk.
