GToolKit is a (relatively) small library that implements a simple and easy to
use Objective-C interface to the GTK+ widget set. Well, the library in itself
does not do very much, of course. It just allows you to write your favourite
program in my favourite programming language ;-). 

Currently implemented features: 

- wrapper classes for all classes in GTK+-1.2 (but not GDK) 
- builds with GNUstep base or libFoundation library 
- OpenStep-like API naming conventions (example) 
- OpenStep-like Application class (GTKApplication) 
- Application and Window delegates 
- Notifications (ApplicationWillTerminate etc.) 
- can load user interfaces created with Glade 
- works in multi-threaded programs (not well tested)
