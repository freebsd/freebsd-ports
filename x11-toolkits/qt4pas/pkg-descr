Provide a Qt4 binding for FreePascal that may be of use to provide the Lazarus
LCL library with a Qt interface

This binding does not aim to cover the whole Qt4 framework, but only just
enough to satisfy the LCL needs. If any LCL/Qt developer needs an extra class,
just ask and it will be added promptly. Some of the methods that have parameters
based upon templates have been omitted.

If however you need any of those, just ask.
