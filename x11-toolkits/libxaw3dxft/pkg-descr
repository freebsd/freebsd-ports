Xaw3dxft is a Xaw (Athena Widget Set) replacement that looks
three-dimensional.

Xaw3dxft is an extended version of xaw3d with support for UTF8 input
and UTF8 encoding of text, and rendering text with the Freetype
library and Truetype fonts. It should be mostly compatible with the
original xaw3d library, except for font management : everything
using the old X11 core font routines should be replaced by their
freetype equivalents.

The main advantage of using libxaw3dxft over libxaw3d or libxaw is
that all text will appear nicely antialiasedd when using truetype fonts
in the menu widgets. Also, the use of UTF8 makes it easier to
internationalize applications in arbitrary languages.
