LessTif is a API compatible clone of the Motif toolkit.  Currently
LessTif is partially implemented with most of the API in place.
Both Motif 1.2 and Motif 2.0 libraries are built and installed.
By default, the 1.2 library is used because it is a more complete
implementation of the Motif 1.2 API.

The Hungry Programmers, the people writing LessTif, have adopted a
naming scheme where an even minor number indicates a stable release
of the libraries and an odd number is a development release. *Ports will
be made for even number releases only.*
