V is a C++ GUI and application development framework for X-windows and
Microsoft Windows.  It allows you to develop GUI applications  that are
source-code compatible under X11 and Microsoft Windows 3.x/95, that have
the same look-and-feel under both environments.  It does not require any
special X toolkits or Windows DLL's to be installed (it uses the standard
toolkits on both environments).

Full documentation, many code examples, and the V toolkit for Windows
systems is available at the V web site:

Documentation (in TeX format) will also be installed under
/usr/X11R6/share/doc/v.
