osm-gps-map is a Gtk mapping widget (and Python bindings) that when
given GPS co-ordinates, draws a GPS track, and points of interest on a
moving map display.

osm-gps-map downloads map data from a number of websites, including
openstreetmap.org, openaerialmap.org and others and can be used to build
desktop mapping or geolocation applications.
