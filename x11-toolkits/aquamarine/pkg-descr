Aquamarine is a very light linux rendering backend library. It
provides basic abstractions for an application to render on a Wayland
session (in a window) or a native DRM session.

It is agnostic of the rendering API (Vulkan/OpenGL) and designed to be
lightweight, performant, and minimal.

Aquamarine provides no bindings for other languages. It is C++-only.
