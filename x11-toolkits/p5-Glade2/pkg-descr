Glade is a free user interface builder for GTK+ and GNOME. After designing a
user interface with glade-2 the layout and configuration are saved in an XML
file. libglade is a library which knows how to build and hook up the user
interface described in the Glade XML file at application run time.

This extension module binds libglade to Perl so you can create and manipulate
user interfaces in Perl code in conjunction with Gtk2 and even Gnome2. Better
yet you can load a file's contents into a PERL scalar do a few magical regular
expressions to customize things and the load up the app.
It doesn't get any easier.
