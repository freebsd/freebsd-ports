LablGtk2 is an OCaml interface to GTK+ 2.x.  It provides a strongly-typed,
yet comfortable, object-oriented interface compatible with GTK+'s dynamic
typing through OCaml's rich type system.  Most widgets and methods are
available, along with many examples.

Objective Caml threads are supported, including for the toplevel, which
allows for interactive use of the library.
