Perl bindings to the 3.x series of the gtk+ toolkit. This module
allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a Perlish and
object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory
management in C, yet remaining very close in spirit to original
API. Find out more about gtk+ at http://www.gtk.org.

The gtk+ reference manual is also a handy companion when writing
Gtk3 programs in Perl: http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/. The
Perl bindings follow the C API very closely, and the C reference
documentation should be considered the canonical source.
