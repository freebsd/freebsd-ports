magicgui is a python library for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

It aims to speed up data workflows by providing a simple, consistent API
for creating GUIs to control various data types, that work across various
environments.

GUIs may be built manually using a variety of widgets, or generated
automatically from python type hints.
