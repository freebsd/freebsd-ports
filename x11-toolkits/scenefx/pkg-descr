wlroots is the de-facto library for building wayland compositors, and
its scene api is a great stride in simplifying wayland compositor
development. The problem with the scene api (for compositors looking
for eye candy), however, is that it forces you to use the wlr
renderer, which is powerful yet simple. SceneFX is a project that
takes the scene api and replaces the wlr renderer with our own fx
renderer, capable of rendering surfaces with eye-candy effects
including blur, shadows, and rounded corners, while maintaining the
benefits of simplicity gained from using the scene api.
