The goal of the qml-box2d plugin is to expose the functionality of Box2D (C++) 
as a QML plugin in order to make it easier to write physics based software in 
QML.

This plugin is meant to be installed to your Qt/imports directory, or shipped 
in a directory of which the parent is added as import path.
