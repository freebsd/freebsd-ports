KDDockWidgets is a Qt dock widget library written by KDAB, suitable for
replacing QDockWidget and implementing advanced functionalities missing
in Qt.

Although KDDockWidgets is ready to be used out of the box, it can also
be seen as a framework to allow building very tailored custom docking systems.
It tries to expose every internal widget and every knob for the app developer
to tune.
