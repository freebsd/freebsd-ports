c++-gtk-utils is a lightweight library containing a number of classes and
functions for programming GTK+ programs using C++ in POSIX (unix-like)
environments, where the user does not want to use a full-on wrapper such as
gtkmm or wxWidgets, or is concerned about exception safety or thread safety
of the wrapper and their documentation.
