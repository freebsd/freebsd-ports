This a re-port of a perl interface to Tk8.4 (John Ousterhout's production
release).

Perl API is essentially the same as Tk800.025 but has not
been verified as compliant.

It also includes all the C code parts of Tix8.1.4 from SourceForge.
The perl code corresponding to Tix's Tcl code is not fully implemented.

This version (Tk804.025) is only likely to work with perl5.8+.
