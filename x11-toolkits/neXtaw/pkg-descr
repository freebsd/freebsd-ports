This is neXtaw, a modified version of the Athena Widgets with N*XTSTEP
appearance. It is based on the Xaw3d 1.5 library by Kaleb Keithley.
This is not a magic library which will beautify all your apps instantly.
But with some .Xdefaults fiddling you can make Athena applications look
and behave much better.
