The Qt Virtual Keyboard project provides an input framework and reference
keyboard frontend for Qt 6 on Linux Desktop/X11, Windows Desktop, and Boot2Qt
targets.

The input framework makes it easy to write custom input methods or to integrate
3rd party input engines. The input methods can be implemented in C++ or QML.
