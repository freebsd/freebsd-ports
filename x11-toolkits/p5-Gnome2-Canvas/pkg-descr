The Gnome Canvas is an engine for structured graphics that offers a rich
imaging model, high-performance rendering, and a powerful, high level API.
It offers a choice of two rendering back-ends, one based on GDK for
extremely fast display, and another based on Libart, a sophisticated,
antialiased, alpha-compositing engine. This widget can be used for flexible
display of graphics and for creating interactive user interface elements.
