This library provides collection of GTK+ widgets that extend functionality
of such standard widgets as GtkEntry and GtkLabel by subclassing them and
working around the limitations of the widgets.  "Sexy" widgets include
support for inline icons, spell checking (via Enchant), embedded hyperlinks,
and more.
