Tk::Toolbar implements a dockable toolbar. It is in the same spirit as the
"short-cut" toolbars found in most major applications, such as most web browsers
and text editors (where you find the "back" or "save" and other shortcut
buttons).

Buttons of any type (regular, menu, check, radio) can be created inside this
widget. You can also create Label, Entry and LabEntry widgets. Moreover, the
ToolBar itself can be made dockable, such that it can be dragged to any edge of
your window. Dragging is done in "real-time" so that you can see the contents of
your ToolBar as you are dragging it. Furthermore, if you are close to a
stickable edge, a visual indicator will show up along that edge to guide you.
ToolBars can be made "floatable" such that if they are dragged beyond their
associated window, they will detach and float on the desktop. Also, multiple
ToolBars are embeddable inside each other.

Various icons are built into the Tk::ToolBar widget. Those icons can be used as
images for ToolButtons (see "SYNOPSIS"). A demo program is bundled with the
module that should be available under the 'User Contributed Demonstrations' when
you run the widget program. Run it to see a list of the available images.
