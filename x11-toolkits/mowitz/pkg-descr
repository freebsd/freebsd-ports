This is the Mowitz ("More widgets") library.

The project's goal is to create  a library of widgets for X applications
to use. The  widgets have been snarfed from various  sources and are all
open source (GPL or MIT licenses).

Available widgets

	o Canvas			    o Ruler
	o Check				    o Slider
	o Combo				    o Spinner
	o Frame				    o Tabs
	o Handle			    o TextField
	o Image				    o Tooltip
	o ListTree			    o VSlider
	o Notebook
	o Rudegrid			    o And a complete menu kit.

The original reason for creating this  library is that the Athena widget
set  lacks a  lot of  widgets  that would  be  useful, and  many of  the
existing widgets leave a lot to be desired in appearance and behaviour.
