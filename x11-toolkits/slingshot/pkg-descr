Slingshot provides rectangles (like the Xt Intrinsics' RectObj gadget),
drag-and-drop support, images, icons and text, trees, lines, arrows...
You can look at the documentation for the details, but here's a few
teasers:  there are new objects (clock, bag, box).  The grip and the
drawarea have had a few interesting features added.  The documentation
has been improved dramatically.  The drawtext can now be editible.
