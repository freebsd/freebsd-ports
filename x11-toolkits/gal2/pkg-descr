GAL is a collection of widgets and utility routines that were taken
from Evolution and Gnumeric.
  
The upcoming version of Evolution and Gnumeric will both require
GAL, as the code has been moved to this new module.
  
The API is not frozen and might change at any time.  Larger class
renaming might happen at any point without notice.  Use this library
at your own risk.
