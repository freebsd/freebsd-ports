Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for developers
using C++ or QML, a CSS/JavaScript-like language.

Provides tools for the cross-platform Qt shader pipeline.
These enable processing graphics and compute shaders to make them usable for
Qt Quick and other components in the Qt ecosystem.
