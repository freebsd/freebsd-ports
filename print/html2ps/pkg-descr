- Much from HTML 4.0 - that is relevant for printing - is supported
  (incidentally, the PostScript and PDF versions of the HTML 4.0 draft,
  were generated using html2ps). For example, all character entities
  (except &zwnj;, &zwj;, &lrm;, and &rlm;) are supported.
- Many possibilities to control the appearance. Starting with this version,
  this is mostly done using configuration files.
- Support for processing multiple documents, also automatically by
  recursively following links.
- A table of contents can be generated, either from the links in a document,
  or automatically from document headings.
- Configurable page headers/footers, that for example can contain
  document title, URL, page number, current heading, and date.
- When converting the PostScript document to PDF - using some other
  program such as version 5.0 or later of Aladdin Ghostscript, or
  Adobe Acrobat Distiller - the original hyperlinks in the HTML
  documents will be retained in the PDF document.
- Automatic hyphenation and text justification can be selected.
