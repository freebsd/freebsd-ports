TTF2PT1 is a modification of Andrew Weeks TTF2PFA True Type to Postscript
Type 3 converter. Which will convert Most True Type Fonts to and Adobe
Type 1 .pfa file. The files produced are in human readable form, which
further needs to be encrypted with the t1utilities, to work with most
software requiring type 1 fonts.
