GL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any OpenGL
application. The main difference between GL2PS and other similar libraries
is the use of sorting algorithms capable of handling intersecting and
stretched polygons, as well as non manifold objects. GL2PS provides advanced
smooth shading and text rendering, culling of invisible primitives, mixed
vector/bitmap output, and much more...

GL2PS can currently create PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)
and Portable Document Format (PDF) files, as well as LATEX files for the
text fragments.
