mftrace is a small Python program that lets you trace a TeX bitmap font into
a PFA or PFB font (A PostScript Type1 Scalable Font).

Type1 fonts offer many advantages over bitmaps, as they allow PostScript
files to render correctly on printers with many resolutions. Moreover,
Ghostscript can generate much better PDF, if given scalable fonts.
