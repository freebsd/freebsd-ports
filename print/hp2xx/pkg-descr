hp2xx reads HPGL ASCII source files, interprets them, and
converts them into either another vector-oriented format
or one of several rasterfile formats. Currently, its HPGL
parser recognizes a subset of the HP 7550A command set.
Some high-level functions like filled polygons are missing
Also, only the basic fixed character set 0 is supported
Besides these limitations, hp2xx has proven to work with
many HP-GL sources without any trouble.

It allows conversion from HPGL to:

	mf (MetaFont), eps (PostScript), pcl (HP-PCL Level3),
	pre(view), pcx (PaintBrush-Format), img (GEM),
        pic (ATARI bitmap), pbm (Portable Bitmap),
	png (Portable Network Graphics), ...
