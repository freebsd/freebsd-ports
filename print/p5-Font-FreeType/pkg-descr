This module allows Perl programs to conveniently read information from
font files. All the font access is done through the FreeType2 library,
which supports many formats. It can render images of characters with
high-quality hinting and antialiasing, extract metrics information,
and extract the outlines of characters in scalable formats like
TrueType.
