foo2zjs is an open source printer driver for printers that use the Zenographics
ZjStream wire protocol for their print data, such as the Minolta/QMS magicolor
2300 DL or Konica Minolta magicolor 2430 DL. These printers are often
erroneously referred to as winprinters or GDI printers.

However, Microsoft GDI only mandates the API between an application and the
printer driver, not the protocol on the wire between the printer driver and the
printer. In fact, ZjStream printers are raster printers which happen to use a
very efficient wire protocol which was developed by Zenographics and licensed
by most major printer manufacturers for at least some of their product lines.

ZjStream is just one of many wire protocols that are in use today, such as
Postscript, PCL, Epson, etc.
