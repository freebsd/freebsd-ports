New in apsfilter 4.9.5: printing of HTML files !

Have fun using apsfilter by saying:

	lpr ascii.Z test.gif picture.tiff TeX.dvi.gz webpage.html

That's what apsfilter is designed for ;-)

apsfilter is a printfilter, that saves you the work to a) look for
and b) use filter programs, that convert your file into something
suitable for your printer.

Everything will be translated into Postscript, first. So you need
ghostscript, if you don't have a PS printer.

Printer Setup is done with the SETUP program. It saves your current
printcap entries and creates printcap entries for one or more of
your local printers. Please note, that such a magic printcap filter
only works on locally connected printers.

Have fun !			Andreas Klemm <andreas@klemm.gtn.com>
