TransFig is a set of tools for creating TeX documents with graphics
which are portable, in the sense that they can be printed in a wide
variety of environments.

Drivers currently exist for the following graphics langauges:
AutoCad slide, BOX, (E)EPIC macros, LaTeX picture environment,
PIC, PiCTeX, PNG, PostScript, Encapsulated Postscript, GIF,
IBM-GL, JPEG, PCX, MF (METAFONT), TeXtyl, TIFF, TPIC, XBM (X11
Bitmap), XPM (X11 Pixmap), and TK (tcl/tk).  Fig2dev can be
configured with a subset of these drivers.
