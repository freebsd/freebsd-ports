CUPS smb backend is now installed.

Please configure your samba environment if
you haven't already done so. To do so edit

%%PREFIX%%/etc/smb.conf

You can then add a new printer to CUPS.
smbspool(8) manpage describes device URI
format. In most cases (latest samba 2.x
and samba 3.x), it's something like this:

smb://username:password@server/printer
smb://username:password@workgroup/server/printer

But a CUPS article describes another syntax,
so beware.
