A clone of the proprietary enscript program from Adobe Systems. For those
who have never used enscript, it is a good ASCII to Postscript converter.

The main features of nenscript are:

        . produces Postscript output which fully conforms to
          the Document Structuring Conventions
        . support for normal and "gaudy" output
        . support for single or double column output
        . allows insertion of titles and headers in any font.
        . multiple copies of a document

Features additional to nenscript are:
        . automatic wrapping of long lines
        . availability under MSDOS 
        . executable is self contained - no additional files required
