This port is for a printer filter of Canon BJ F360. The filter is
called Canon Bubble Jet Print Filter for Linux and there exist the
filters for other Canon bubble jet printers. By using this driver you
can print out as high quality as you use the Windows driver. See the
below URLs:

And then this port has filters filter360 and filter360_gui which are
useful to print out more than one page. Then you execute the next
command:

/usr/local/libexec/bjfilter360/setup

to setup /etc/printcap and make spools in /var/spool/lpd/.

Notice: If you use filter360_gui in the printer server, for example
hostA then you have to run X, execute "xhost hostA" and execute "lpr" on
the host which you are using.
