CUPS-PDF is designed to produce PDF files in a heterogeneous network by
providing a PDF printer on the central fileserver. After restarting CUPS, you
will be able to choose "CUPS-PDF (Virtual PDF Printer)" when setting up a new
printer in CUPS. Once you print to the new device all converted PDF files will
be placed in the specified directory.
