CUPS-PDF is designed to produce PDF files in a heterogeneous network by
providing a PDF printer on the central fileserver.

After restarting CUPS, you will be able to choose
"Virtual Printer (PDF Printer)" when setting up a new printer in CUPS.

Once you print to the new device all converted PDF files will be placed in
the specified directory.
