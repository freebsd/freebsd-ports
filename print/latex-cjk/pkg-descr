Welcome to CJK version 4.3.0 (20-Jun-1999), a LaTeX2e macro package which
enables the use of CJK scripts (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) in various
encodings.

=====
This port installs full Chinese BIG5/GB support, including TTF fonts. For
other Asian languages, you have to supply those TTF fonts, then manually
modify relative settings.
