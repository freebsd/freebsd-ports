pgf stands for `portable graphics format'. It is a TeX macro package
that allows you to create graphics in your TeX documents using a special
pgfpicture environment and special macros for drawing lines, curves,
rectangles, and many other kind of graphic objects.
Its usage closely resembles the pstricks package or the normal picture
environment of LaTeX.
