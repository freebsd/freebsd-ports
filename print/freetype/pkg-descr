The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering
engine.  It  has been developed to  provide TT support  to a great
variety of platforms and environments.

Notice that  FreeType is a *library*.   It is *not*  a font server
for  your preferred environment,  even though  it was  designed to
allow the design of many font servers.
