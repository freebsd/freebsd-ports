ufomerge is a command line utility and Python library merges together two UFO
source format fonts into a single file. It can be used to include glyphs from
one font into another font. It takes care of handling:
- Glyph outlines and information
- Kerning
- lib entries
- Including any needed components
- "Subsetting" and merging layout rules
