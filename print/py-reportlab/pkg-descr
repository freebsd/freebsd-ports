ReportLab is a software library that lets you directly create
documents in Adobe's Portabe Document Format (PDF) using the Python
programming language.

The ReportLab library directly creates PDF based on your graphics
commands. There are no intervening steps. Your applications can
generate reports extremely fast - sometimes orders of magnitude
faster than traditional report-writing tools.

The ReportLab library is expected to be useful in at least the
following contexts:

- Dynamic PDF generation on the web
- High-volume corporate reporting and database publishing
- An embeddable print engine for other applications, including
  a 'report language' so that users can customize their own reports.
- A 'build system' for complex documents with charts, tables
  and text such as management accounts, statistical reports and
  scientific papers
- Going from XML to PDF in one step!
