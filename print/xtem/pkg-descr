xtem - TeX menu for the X Window System

xtem is an X11 program that makes it easy to use TeX (incl.
editing, previewing, printer selection, printing, spell checking
etc.) with a minimum of unix knowledge and no knowledge of the
specific installation.

Syntax help to the LaTeX commands (including complete examples)
are presented during editing.

xtem runs on workstations (and X-terminals) running the X Window
System and Tcl/Tk/TclX.

The user may easily select and save his preferences (such as
editor, previewer etc.).

Buttons, help texts, etc. can be set to the user's preferred
language. At the moment the following languages are already
available: English and German (Others can be added "easily" by
editing the helpfiles accordingly).
