PDFlib is a library of C routines which allow you to programmatically
generate files in Adobe's Portable Document Format PDF.  PDFlib
acts as a backend processor to your own programs. While you (the
programmer) are responsible for retrieving or maintaining the data
to be processed, PDFlib takes over the task of generating the PDF
code which graphically represents your data. While you must still
format and arrange your text and graphical objects, PDFlib frees
you from the internals and intricacies of PDF. Although being far
from complete, PDFlib already offers many useful functions for
creating text, graphics, images and hypertext elements in PDF files.
