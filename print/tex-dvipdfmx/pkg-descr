The dvipdfmx (formerly dvipdfm-cjk) project provides an eXtended version of
the dvipdfm, a DVI to PDF translator developed by Mark A. Wicks. The primary
goal of this project is to support multi-byte character encodings and large
character sets for East Asian languages by CID-keyed font technology. The
secondary goal is to support as many features as pdfTeX developed by Han The
Thanh. This project is a combined work of the dvipdfm-jpn project by
Shunsaku Hirata and its modified one, dvipdfm-kor, by Jin-Hwan Cho.
