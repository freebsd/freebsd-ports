To enable printing with local printer you need to give group 'cups'
r/w access to printer device:

1) Add following to /etc/devfs.rules (create if it doesn't exist):

[system=10]
add path 'unlpt*' mode 0660 group cups
add path 'ulpt*' mode 0660 group cups
add path 'lpt*' mode 0660 group cups

2) And following to /etc/rc.conf:

devfs_system_ruleset="system"

3) Restart devfs: /etc/rc.d/devfs restart

If your system supports 'devd' you can copy
$PREFIX/share/examples/cups/lpt-cupsd.conf to $PREFIX/etc/devd/

To enable printing under Gimp and MS-Windows clients do the following:

1) Uncomment application/octet-stream line in mime.types
2) Uncomment application/octet-stream line in mime.convs
3) Restart cupsd

If you are using libusb, it is important that no device driver, e.g.
ulpt(4) is attached to the device you wish to use. In this case please
ensure the cups user and group has read/write access to /dev/ugen*
