PDF::Template is a layout system that creates Adobe PDF files from the same
data structure used by HTML::Template.

Currently, the only renderer support is pdflib_pl, which is from PDFLib
(www.pdflib.com). There is a free version (PDFLib Lite), but that does not
handle Unicode. If you need CJK fonts, you will need to purchase the full
version of PDFLib from them.
