glyphsets helps evaluate coverage of glyph sets in font projects

If you are a font developer or typeface designer, see the
"Lib/glyphsets/encodings/GF Glyph Sets" subdirectory which provides glyph set
definition "standards" that are typically useful sets to draw.

On the other hand, the nam files on the "Lib/glyphsets/encodings" directory are
probably more useful for expert web developers. Those files explain how the
Unicode Range subsets are defined, typically per script (writing system), in the
Google Fonts css API.
