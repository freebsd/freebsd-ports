CUPS is now installed.

Please read the documentation in %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/cups/ for information
on how to set up your printer to use CUPS. Basic template configuration files
have been installed in %%PREFIX%%/etc/cups/

Please note that the cups port installs tools with conflicting names to the
freebsd printing system. At a minimum users PATH environment should have
%%PREFIX%%/bin before /usr/bin to use the correct tools. You may also
consider removing the freebsd printing tools and set NO_LPR=true in your
/etc/make.conf to prevent them building in future make world's. This would
not of course prevent them from being reinstalled during a binary upgrade.

The relevant files for the freebsd printing system are:
/usr/bin/lp* /usr/sbin/lpc /usr/sbin/lpd /usr/share/man/cat*/lp*
/usr/share/man/man1/lp.* /usr/share/man/man1/lp[a-s,u-z]*
