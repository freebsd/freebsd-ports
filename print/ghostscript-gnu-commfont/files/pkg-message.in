=== NOTE ===

The CJK font selection will be performed in the following order:

 1. %%PREFIX%%/%%GS_RESDIR%%/Font/<fontname>

 2. %%PREFIX%%/%%GS_RESDIR%%/CIDFont/<fontname>

 3. %%PREFIX%%/share/ghostscript/%%PORTVERSION%%/lib/CIDFnmap

So, to use CIDFnmap you have to make sure that there is no font file that
has the same name as you want to customize in Resource/Font and
Resource/CIDFont.
