This package has been compiled with some defaults:
1 fonts will be created in $prefix/lib/texmf/fonts/pk and this
  directory will be made world writable

2 300 dpi fonts will be created with MODE=imagen
  200 dpi fonts will be created with MODE=FAX
  360 dpi fonts will be created with MODE=nextII
  400 dpi fonts will be created with MODE=nexthi
   72 dpi fonts will be created with MODE=nextscreen

3 paper size is 8.5in x 11in (letter)

If you are not satisfied with 1, you need to recompile dvips
If you are not satisfied with 2, you will need to edit $prefix/MakeTeXPK
If you are not satisfied with 3 or 4, you will need to edit $prefix/lib/texmf/ps/config.ps
