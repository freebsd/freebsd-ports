This is a filter that converts text files to PostScript, RTF, or HTML
and then spools generated output to a printer or dumps it to a file.
Input files in a number of programming languages, including C, Perl,
Tcl, and more, can optionally be pretty-printed instead of printed as
plain-text.  Many printing options are available.
