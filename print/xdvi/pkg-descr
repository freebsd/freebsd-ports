xdvi is a program which runs under the X window system. It is used to
preview files, such as are produced by TeX. This program has the
capability of showing the file shrunken by various (integer) factors,
and also has a ``magnifying glass'' which allows one to see a small
part of the unshrunk image momentarily.  In addition to using
keystrokes to move within the file, xdvi provides buttons on the right
side of the window, which are synonymous with various sequences of
keystrokes.  xdvi is also able to show PostScript<tm> specials if
Ghostscript is installed on your system.

The commands from this port overwrite those from teTeX.
