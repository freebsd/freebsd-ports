The purpose of dot2tex is to give graphs generated by Graphviz a more LaTeX
friendly look and feel. This is accomplished by converting xdot output from
Graphviz to a series of PSTricks or PGF/TikZ commands. This approach allows:

  - Typesetting labels with LaTeX, allowing mathematical notation.
  - Using native PSTricks and PGF/TikZ commands for drawing arrows (optional).
  - Using backend specific styles to customize the output
