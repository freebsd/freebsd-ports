/usr/bin/dialog --title "Ghostscript 4 driver configuration" --clear \
	--checklist "\n\
This new ghostscript driver configuration dialog allows you to choose \n\
only those gs drivers, you really need. Don't think too economical, since \n\
other programs in the ports collection might need some of the default gs \n\
file format drivers. The gs4 default drivers are preselected. \n\
Have fun with this new configuration style !     -andreas \n\n\
