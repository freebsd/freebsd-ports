You may want to run texconfig to configure teTeX for your
local environment. You will find teTeX's local documentation
in %%PREFIX%%/%%TEXMFDISTDIR%%/doc/.

Note that if you have environment variables for teTeX in a wrong
way (such as TEXINPUTS, TEXMF, TEXMFCNF, and so on),
they may prevent teTeX from working.
