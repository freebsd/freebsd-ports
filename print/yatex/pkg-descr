YaTeX automates typesetting and previewing of LaTeX and enables
completing input of LaTeX mark-up command such as `\begin{}'..`\end{}'.

YaTeX also supports Demacs which runs on MS-DOS(386), Mule (Multi
Language Enhancement to GNU Emacs), and latex on DOS.

You need to adjust your init file, ~/.emacs.  This port has a setup
script 'user-install'. Please execute it as the following:

sh /usr/local/share/doc/yatex/user-install

**      About yahtml        **
******************************
Yahtml is a brand new package for writing HTML files with Emacs. It is
very far from html-mode, html-helper-mode or other existing HTML modes.
It is a good successor of YaTeX in HTML world.

To install yahtml, see the guidance in the beginning of
site-lisp/yatex/yahtml.el.
