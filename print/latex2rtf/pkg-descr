latex2rtf is a translator program that translates LaTeX text into the
RTF format used by several textprocessors, including Microsoft Word
and Word for Windows.  It was written by Fernando Dorner and Andreas
Granzer in a one-semester course in our department.  It was later
updated in another one-semester course by Friedrich Polzer and Gerhard
Trisko.  Ralf Schlatterbeck <ralf@zoo.priv.at> maintained and extended
it until 1998.  It is currently being maintained by Georg Lehner,
Scott Pralh, and Wilfried Hennings
