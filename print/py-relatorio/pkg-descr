relatorio is a templating library which provides a way to easily output
all kind of different files (odt, ods, png, svg, ...). Adding support
for more filetype is easy: you just have to create a plugin for this.
relatorio also provides a report repository allowing you to link python
objects and report together, find reports by mimetypes/name/python
objects.
