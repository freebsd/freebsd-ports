LGrind is a descendant of the Unix utility vgrind. It is
used to produce a beautified version of your source code using LaTeX. Unlike
other packages this is not pure TeX but an external preprocessor. You run e.g.
    lgrind example.c > example.tex
    latex example.tex
to get a complete listing. Options for producing includable files and pro-
cessing embedded listings in LaTeX texts are provided.
