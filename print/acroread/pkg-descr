Acrobat Reader is part of the Adobe Acrobat family of software, which lets 
you view, distribute, and print documents in Portable Document Format 
(PDF)--regardless of the computer, operating system, fonts, or application 
used to create the original file.  PDF files retain all the formatting, 
fonts, and graphics of the original document, and virtually any 
PostScript(TM) document can be converted into a PDF file.
