This is a perl script that can generate compact, DSC-compliant Postscript out
of a plain text file and a BDF font. The output can be previewed using
Ghostscript under most platforms, or with the Windows shareware program
"ROPS", or printed on Postscript printers, or converted to PDF using "ps2pdf".

The motivation for creating this script was to be able to print texts in
international character sets. Since it's much easier to create or edit bitmap
(BDF/PCF) fonts than outline fonts, this script allows to print texts using
your own fonts.
