**************** UPGRADE FROM 1.X NOTICE *****************

NOTE: If you are upgrading from 1.x you will need to
change your devfs ruleset as hpiod is now gone, so remove
it from you rc.conf.  The printer communication now runs
through cupsd.  You will need to make the devfs ruleset
changes to allow cups to access the usb bus and ugen
devices so that it can enumerate the printers.  You will
also need to update your hplip.conf.  See the instructions
below.

**************** UPGRADE FROM 1.X NOTICE *****************

*Please note, the new version does not need a rc.d startup file
hplip now has it's own toolbox icon which gets started,
during system startup.

So all you have to do if you have a custom ruleset setup
is add the following to that ruleset in devfs.rules:

add path 'usb*' group cups
add path 'usb*' mode 0660
add path 'ugen*' group cups
add path 'ugen*' mode 0660

If you have never setup devfs.rules please read the
manpage and see:
http://am-productions.biz/docs/devfs.rules.php

The printer MUST attach as a ugen(4) device.  This means
that you must NOT have "device ulpt" in your kernel and
ulpt must NOT be loaded as a kernel module.

If you are seeing device connection errors restart the
printing chain with the following command.  NOTE: It MUST
be restarted in the stated order.
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/hpssd restart && \
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/cupsd restart

If upgrading from a version < 2.7.9 copy the new
hplip.conf.sample config.
cp %%PREFIX%%/etc/hp/hplip.conf.sample \
   %%PREFIX%%/etc/hp/hplip.conf

If you are still having problems check:
http://am-productions.biz/docs/hplip.php
If you are still having problems send the relevant part
of your /var/log/messages, console output from the hp-*
utility that you are trying to run, and your rc.conf +
devfs.rules files and the output of "ls -l /dev" to the
maintainer.
