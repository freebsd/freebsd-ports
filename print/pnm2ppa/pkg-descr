This software creates output using the PPA (printer performance
architecture) protocol.  This protocol is used by some HP "Windows-only"
printers, including the HP Deskjet 820C series, the HP DeskJet 720 series,
and the HP DeskJet 1000 series.  It has been tested on all three printers,
but your personal experience (positive or negative) is very much appreciated!
