A LaTeX macro package for drawing Message Sequence Charts by Victor Bos 
and Sjouke Mauw.
This package should be useful to all people that prepare their texts with
LaTeX and want to easily draw MSCs in their texts. This is not an MSC editor. 
It simply takes a textual description of an MSC and draws the corresponding 
MSC. 

The current version of the MSC macro package supports the full MSC2000 
language.
