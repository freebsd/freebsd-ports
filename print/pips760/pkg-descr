This port has a modified filter "filter760.rev" which is useful to
print out more than one page. Then you execute the next command:

/usr/local/libexec/pips760/setup

to setup /etc/printcap, make a spool in /var/spool/lpd/ and so on.

To run with Japanese/French/Germany/Spanish/Italian/Dutch/
Portugue/Korean messages, you should execute as follows:
  env LANG=ja_JP pips760          env LANG=fr pips760	  
  env LANG=de pips760             env LANG=es pips760

  env LANG=pt pips760             env LANG=ko pips760 (*)
  env LANG=zh_CN pips760 (*)(**)  env LANG=zh_TW.Big5 pips760 (**)
