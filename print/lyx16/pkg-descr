LyX is a document processor interfaced with LaTeX, which gives both the
ease-of-use of a wordprocessor, and the flexibility and power of
LaTeX.

Quasi-WYSIWYG interface, many LaTeX styles and layouts automatically
generated. Speeds up learning LaTeX and makes complicated layouts
easy and intuitive. New features include spell-checking, international
character support, WYSIWYG graphics, tables, and equations.
