Foomatic is a database-driven system for integrating free software
printer drivers with common spoolers under Unix. It supports CUPS,
LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr, Solaris LP, PPR, PDQ, CPS, and direct printing
with every free software printer driver known to us and every printer
known to work with these drivers.
