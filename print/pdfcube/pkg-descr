PDF Cube uses the OpenGL API to add 3D spinning cube page transitions to PDF
documents.

PDF Cube is an OpenGL API-based 3D PDF viewer that adds a compiz/Keynote-like
spinning cube trasition effect to your PDF presentations (including
LaTeX-Beamer and Prosper). You can also zoom on 5 predefined areas of any
presentation page with a smooth zooming effect.
