cdlabelgen's purpose in life is twofold:

       o To be run automatically and swiftly from a shell script
            and automatically generate a frontcard and a traycard
            for a cd--usually data archive cd's. The traycard
            (which goes behind the CD itself) is U-shaped and the
            ends of the CD case bear the label of what the CD is.

       o To have a minimum of dependencies--cdlabelgen only
            requires perl.

       cdlabelgen was designed to simplify the process of
       generating labels for CD's. It originated as a program to
       allow auto generation of frontcards and traycards for CD's
       burned via an automated mechanism (specifically for
       archiving data), but has now become popular for labelling
       CD compilations of mp3's, and copies of CDs. Note that
       cdlabelgen does not actually print anything--it just spits
       out postscript, which you can then do with as you please.
