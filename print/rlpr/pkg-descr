Send print jobs to lpd servers anywhere on a network. Does not require
lpd server to be listed in client's /etc/printcap, and is therefore
useful for printing from machines one does not have root access on.

Gettext  (-lintl) is  not used by  this port  because  it adds  bloat
without functionality -- there are  no language files supplied with this
package yet. May be in future versions.
