DVISVG creates one SVG Document, which includes content of the selected page
from the specified DVI file. DVISVG produces outlines for used glyphs/characters
in DVI file as an external SVG Font.

SVG Document produced by DVISVG uses external SVG Fonts so there is
a problem with using Adobe's SVG Viewer which doesn't currently support it.
Solution is using embeded fonts which can to be easily inserted in svg file
from the external fonts file.
