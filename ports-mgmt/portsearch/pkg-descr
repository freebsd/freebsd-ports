Portsearch allows searching for ports that install some file, like
``find /usr/ports -name pkg-plist |xargs grep pattern''
but honoring PLIST_(FILES|DIRS) and %%FOOBAR%% variables.
It also supports searching for ports by name, key (name, comment or
dependencies), path, info (comment), maintainer, category, fetch, extract,
patch, build and run dependencies and www site.
