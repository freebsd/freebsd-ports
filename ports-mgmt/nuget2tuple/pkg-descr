nuget2tuple is a FreeBSD ports utility that analyzes .NET projects
(.csproj and .fsproj files) and generates the NUGET_NUPKGS knob that
lists all NuGet package dependencies.

The tool:
- Runs dotnet restore with a temporary packages directory
- Extracts all package names and versions
- Automatically detects and adds runtime packages for self-contained builds
  (Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime, Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Runtime,
   and Microsoft.NETCore.App.Host)
- Outputs packages in the format required by FreeBSD port Makefiles

This is useful for port maintainers who need to create or update .NET
application ports that use NuGet packages.
