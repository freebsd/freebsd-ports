Make a pkg-plist for a FreeBSD port. Try to be as "automatic" as possible.

That's all it does ;-)

Basic usage
===========
1. Build your port to the staging directory: `make stage`.
2. Run this from your port's directory (or set `-p`).

Alternatively, you can install your ports to a "fake" prefix, this is the "old"
from before staging support, but it has the added advantage that you've tested
whether your port works when installing to a different prefix.

1. Build & install your port with a different `PREFIX`: `make install
   PREFIX=/var/tmp/ptest`.
2. Run this from your port's directory with `-x` set to `PREFIX`.
