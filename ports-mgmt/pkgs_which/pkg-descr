pkgs_which is a Perl script to efficiently determine, from a set of
files and/or directories, which ports/packages have installed fiels
here.  It does not require a database and is useful to determine which
ports need to be upgraded after, for instance, a script language
interpreter has been updated and needs the site-packages reinstalled.
