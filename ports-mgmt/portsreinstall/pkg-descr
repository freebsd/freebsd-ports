This is a ports upgrading utility as a replacement of portupgrade
and portmaster to facilitate the perfect upgrade of the whole
packages in heavly customized systems by configuration
compatible with portupgrade. Most of the issues in
/usr/ports/UPDATING are resolved automatically. Robust
restarting functionality against manual/sudden termination is
implemented for facilitating package build in busy or low-
performance machines. Utilities for building packages in a chroot
environment are also provided for safe upgrade.
