Portupgrade is a tool to upgrade installed packages via ports or
packages.  It upgrades installed packages without reinstalling
depending or dependent packages by directly updating the package
registry database located under /var/db/pkg, while it can also trace
dependency chains up and down to upgrade packages recursively.

This package also includes the following utilities:
portinstall:	Helps you install new ports in a handy way.
portcvsweb:	Instantly browses change history via CVSweb.
portversion:	Replaces pkg_version(1), runs much faster and is
		cooperative with portupgrade(1).
portsclean:	Cleans ports workdir's, unreferenced distfiles,
		old and orphan shared libraries, and stale packages.
portsdb:	Creates binary database from the ports INDEX.
ports_glob:	Expands ports globs.
pkg_deinstall:	Wraps pkg_delete(1) and provides extra features.
pkg_fetch:	Fetches packages from a remote site.
pkg_glob:	Expands package globs.
pkg_which:	Checks which package a file came from quickly.
pkgdb:		Manipulate the package database and interactively
		fixes most problems in the /var/db/pkg registry.
