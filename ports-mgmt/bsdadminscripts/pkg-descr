This is a collection of administration scripts. At the moment it
consists of a script to control rc.d scripts at runtime, a
script that runs common make targets on batches of ports, scripts to set
variables for make jobs (like portconf, but with more possibilities).
And scripts to check for broken packages and missing libraries.
