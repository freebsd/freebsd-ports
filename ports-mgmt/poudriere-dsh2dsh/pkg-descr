poudriere is a tool primarily designed to test package production on FreeBSD.
However, most people will find it useful to bulk build ports for FreeBSD.

Changes from upstream:

  * Better reuse of prebuilded FreeBSD packages.
  * Speedup building by rebuilding only changed ports.
  * Share go mod cache between builders and store downloaded modules in
    `DISTFILES_CACHE`.
