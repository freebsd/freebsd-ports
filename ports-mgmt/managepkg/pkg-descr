This script runs though the complete ports tree without stopping after a make
error occurred.
If you call make with any parameter in one of the directories of the ports tree
in FreeBSD the run will stop if make returns with a code bigger than zero. That
means, that it is (in opposite to NetBSD or OpenBSD impossible to run a echo
complete build with \"make\" in FreeBSD.

Warning: The run of the script may last days (but you may stop it any time).

Call the script with the parameter you want to give to make, for instance fetch,
build, install, or package.
