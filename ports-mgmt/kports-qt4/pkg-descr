KPorts is KDE-Frontend to the FreeBSD-Ports and in future also to the
OpenBsd-Ports, PkgSrc and maybe others.
You can browse and search through your Portstree and perform actions
like Upgrades, Installs, Uninstall a.s.o. More advanced features like
setting Options and Vulnerability checking are also available. For a
complete list, check the Homepage or the Changelog.
Functionality is KPorts' main goal, not simplification by reducing
options; however KPorts should be rather easy to use.

A new version of KPorts based on completely new code and Qt4 is 
available @ /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/kports-qt4
NOTE that the new version cannot yet compete with this version
feature-wise.
