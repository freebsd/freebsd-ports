With portest, you can create, update, patch and revert a port tree with
svn, git and portsnap. Portest can also do portlint testing, test a port
with port test, or poudriere, and also generate a list of ports a
patchfile(s) will modify. Portest is written in shell with minimal
dependencies mostly using FreeBSD-base
