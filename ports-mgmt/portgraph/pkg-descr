Started from an idea on twitter and used to reduce the dependencies of a port,
here is a python script to produce dependencies' graph of a(ll) FreeBSD port(s).

'portgraph' produces a graph (.dot and svg) representing the dependencies needed
for a given port or all ports thanks to graphviz and the power of make 
{build,run}-depends-list.
