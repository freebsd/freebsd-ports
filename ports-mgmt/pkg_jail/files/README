#
#	Intended to run within a jailed System:
#	---------------------------------------
#
#
#	pkg_update cvsup
#		Installs a copy of cvsup-without-gui package and start
#		"make update" for the ports tree.
#
#
#	pkg_update make-packages
#		Builds a port and its dependencies in a clean /usr/local.
#		You should not run this on a server with configuration.
#		Existing packages are used.
#		Extra files in "${PREFIX}" are detected and reported.
#		The default list of ports is "data/make-packages.${hostname}"
#
#
#	pkg_update clean-distfiles
#		Checks all distinfo files and moves the disfiles not found
#		to "/usr/ports/distfiles/Old/".
#
#
#	pkg_update merge-distfiles
#		Copy all disfiles found that do not yet exist on the master
#		directory "/media/ports/distfiles/".
#
#
#	pkg_update clean-packages
#		Synopsis:
#		Find obsolete packages and move them out of the way
#
#		Problem:
#		Installation of a package with multiple dependencys.
#		pkg_add installs the depended package, and its requirements.
#		When the depended package has been updated,
#		The packages that require this are no longer up to date.
#
#		Solution:
#		Use pkg_info on each package and compare the versions
#		with the new versions in the ports tree, if they don't
#		match report it, and move it out of the "All" directory
#		"/usr/ports/packages/All/" into a seperate directory
#		"/usr/ports/packages/Old/" for later cleanup.
#		Then remove all stale links to the moved packages.
#
#	pkg_update clean-openssl-packages
#		Find packages that use openssl and move them out of the way
#
#	pkg_update full-update-jail
#		do full update cycle
#		1) "cvsup" to update the ports tree
#		2) "clean-distfiles" to keep only current distfiles
#		3) "clean-packages" to keep only good packages
#		4) remove all old error logs
#		5) "make-packages" to rebuild missing packages
#
#	pkg_update full-update-jail retry
#		Skip "cvsup" and procced as above.
#
#
#	clean-usr-lib.sh:
#		Cleans the base system after installworld.
#		move old libs to comapt, so old applications keep running,
#		but new applications can only link to up-to-date libs.
#
#
#

#	-----------------------
#
#	pkg_update fetch-distfiles

#	pkg_update show-version-list
#		List installed packages that are not in correct version

#		For each port recorded from "make-deinstall-list",
#		keep only the ports that have no package installed.
#
#	pkg_update deinstall-packages
