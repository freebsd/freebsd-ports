This is a collection of scripts around the use of ports and packages.

It allows you to: 
- check library dependencies without producing false positives (pkg_libchk)
- lets you manage the autoremove flag for leaf packages (pkg_trim)
- remove obsolete or damaged distfiles (distviper)
- manage build flags (buildflags.conf)
- auto-create pkg-plist files taking port options into account (makeplist)
