.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_cutleaves
.Nd deinstall 'leaf' packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cFglRVx
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm pkg_cutleaves
finds installed 
.Dq Li "leaf"
packages, i.e. packages that are not referenced by any other installed package,
and lets you decide for each one if you want to keep or deinstall it (via
pkg_delete(1)). Once the packages marked for removal have been
flushed/deinstalled, you'll be asked if you want to do another run (i.e. to see
packages that have become 'leaves' now because you've deinstalled the package(s)
that depended on them.
.Ar Note:
see
.Fl R
below to bypass interactive dependency removal). In every run you will be shown 
only packages that you haven't marked for keeping, yet.
.Pp
Note that your package registry database should be up to date for this
to work properly, so it might be a good idea to run pkgdb(1) before
running
.Nm .
.Sh OPTIONS
.Pp
The following command line arguments are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "-R" -compact
.It Fl c
When listing leaf packages, also print their comments/short
descriptions. Will be ignored unless the 
.Fl l
parameter is given, too.
.Pp
.It Fl F
Run
.Dq Li "pkgdb -F"
after each deinstallation run, to make sure the package registry database 
is up to date. (
.Ar Note:
This is mostly for convenience; it shouldn't be necessary to run
.Dq Li "pkgdb -F"
after each run, but it doesn't hurt, either.)
.Pp
.It Fl L
Interpret exclude file as a list of leaf packages that
.Ar should
be installed. Report lint such as lines that match no installed packages
or excluded packages that are not leaves.
.Pp
.It Fl g
Generate the exclude list from kept or installed (when run with 
.Fl l
or 
.Fl L )
leaf packages.
.Pp
.It Fl l
List leaf packages only, one per line, and don't ask for anything to be
deinstalled.
.Pp
.It Fl V
Visual mode. Will compile a list of leaf packages and invoke the user's
.Ev EDITOR .
Lines or package names that are deleted in the editor will then be removed.
.Pp
.It Fl R
Autoprune mode. Automatically deinstall non-required packages on which 
the removed leaf packages depended. Will not remove packages on the 
exclude list if 
.Fl x
is also in effect.
.Pp
.It Fl x
Exclude packages matching expressions given in the exclude file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pp
.Bl -bullet
.It
Interactively cut leaf packages using the current exclude list:
.Pp
.Dl pkg_cutleaves -x
.Pp
.It
List all current leaf packages with comments:
.Pp
.Dl pkg_cutleaves -lc
.Pp
.It
List packages not currently excluded and regenerate a new exclude file
with both the listed and previously excluded packages:
.Pp
.Dl pkg_cutleaves -lxg
.Pp
.It
Interactively cut current leaf packages and remove newly discovered leaves,
i.e. dependencies, automatically:
.Pp
.Dl pkg_cutleaves -R
.Pp
.It
The same as the previous example but use the current exclude list to filter
all first-level leaves and any newly discovered leaves. Generate a new
exclude file with the remaining leaves:
.Pp
.Dl pkg_cutleaves -Rxg
.Pp
.It
Find exclude patterns that match nothing and those that match required packages,
i.e. non-leaves:
.Pp
.Dl pkg_cutleaves -L
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag
.It Pa /usr/local/etc/pkg_leaves.exclude
An optional list for excluding packages when the
.Fl x
or
.Fl L
options are given. If the beginning of a package's name matches any line (except
comment or empty lines) in this file, the package will not be
listed/offered for removal (e.g., a line saying just
.Ar XFree86
will exclude all packages with names starting with
.Dq Li "XFree86"
). The list can be auto-generated with the
.Fl g
option. 
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables will be used in visual mode:
.Bl -tag -width EDITOR
.It Ev EDITOR
The editor specified by the variable
.Ev EDITOR
will be invoked instead of the default editor
.Xr vi 1 .
