Synth is a custom packge repository builder for FreeBSD and DragonFly.

It is intended to replace Portmaster, portupgrade, and poudriere for
the average user.  It is simple to learn (the powerful options are
limited in number) and user-friendly, but it is extremely fast due
to its parallel building capability.  It will "drop-in" on any system
as it leverages the stock pkg(8) facilities.  All ports are built
in a clean environment, so it is finally safe to build ports as
needed on a live system.  The default profile is the system itself, not
a new jail, which can be a valuable feature for some environments.

To bring a system up-to-date only requires one command after the ports
tree is updated:

  > synth upgrade-system

During the building process, a curses-based display will show the status
of all the builders and the entire bulk run process. A dynamic and
searchable web-based report is generated simultaneously. Synth is intended
to be grasped and utilized by novice users within minutes, but offers
most of the same powerful features as Poudriere for the power users.
Synth requires no preparation; it works immediately upon installation.
