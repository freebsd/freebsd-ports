reprise is a tool primarily designed to test package production on
FreeBSD. Unlike poudriere, it's focused on port testing only, without
support for repository production, and has important features still
lacking in poudriere, such as `make test` support, and more eager
use of prebuilt packages. As a result, with reprise you test your
ports, not rebuild llvm and other heavy dependencies over and over
again.
