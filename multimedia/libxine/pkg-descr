xine is a free multimedia player. It plays back CDs, DVDs, and VCDs.
It also decodes multimedia files like AVI, MOV, WMV, and MP3 from local disk
drives, and displays multimedia streamed over the Internet. It interprets many
of the most common multimedia formats available.

These are the libraries for the xine.
