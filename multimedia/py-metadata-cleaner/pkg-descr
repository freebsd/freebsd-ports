Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data
about when a picture was taken and what camera was used. Office
applications automatically add author and company information to
documents and spreadsheets. Maybe you don't want to disclose those
pieces of information.

This tool allows you to view metadata in your files and to get rid of
them, as much as possible.

Under the hood, it relies on mat2 to parse and remove the metadata.
