The Fraunhofer Versatile Video Encoder (VVenC) is a fast and efficient
H.266/VVC encoder implementation with the following main features:
- Easy to use encoder implementation with five predefined
  quality/speed presets;
- Perceptual optimization to improve subjective video quality, based
  on the XPSNR visual model;
- Extensive frame-level and task-based parallelization with very good
  scaling;
- Frame-level single-pass and two-pass rate control supporting
  variable bit-rate (VBR) encoding;
- Expert mode encoder interface available, allowing fine-grained
  control of the encoding process.
