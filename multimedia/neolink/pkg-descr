Neolink is a small program that acts as a proxy between Reolink IP cameras and
normal RTSP clients. Certain cameras, such as the Reolink B800, do not implement
ONVIF or RTSP, but instead use a proprietary "Baichuan" protocol only compatible
with their apps and NVRs (any camera that uses "port 9000" will likely be using
this protocol).

Neolink allows you to use NVR software such as Shinobi or Blue Iris to receive
video from these cameras instead. The Reolink NVR is not required, and the
cameras are unmodified. Your NVR software connects to Neolink, which forwards
the video stream from the camera.

The Neolink project is not affiliated with Reolink in any way; everything it
does has been reverse engineered.
