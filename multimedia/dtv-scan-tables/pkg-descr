Digital TV initial scanning tables are used to speed up scanning for DTV
frequencies. Most dvb applications rely on them.

This supplies initial data for certain regions so that the dvb applications
in question only scan those known frequencies, saving a lot of time scanning.
These tables however need to be kept up to date by users.
