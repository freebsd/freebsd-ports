======================================================================
In order to run the kscd program properly, please run as root:

	chmod 666 <cdrom_device>

to give permission to access the CD-ROM device.

For example, if you have an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM device:

	chmod 666 /dev/acd0c

Additional instructions for using the audiocd:/ kioslave:

If you have an SCSI CD-ROM or if you have an IDE/ATAPI drive AND 
you have activated ATAPICAM in your kernel, change the permissions for
the CAM transport layer and CAM passthrough layer devices to 666, i.e.: 

	chmod 666 /dev/xpt0 /dev/pass0

For ATAPI CD-ROMs and no ATAPICAM, the instructions for kscd apply.

In order to make these changes permanent on FreeBSD 5.x, you have to
add them to /etc/devfs.conf. Further instructions and examples on how
to do this can be found there as well.
