This is a fork off of the vstream library from the tivo-mplayer project.
It has been stripped down to just the client code, and includes an example
client application.  If you have vserver installed on your Tivo (which most
tivo hackers do), then you can use this simple client to stream .ty files
from it.  MPlayer will also include support for this library soon.  This
library can also be used by MPlayer/MEncoder to watch/re-encode tivo
streams live over a network.

(As of October 2005, mplayer does in fact have support for this library.)
