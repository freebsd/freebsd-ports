High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the latest generation video compression
standard.

  * This standard was developed by the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group
    (MPEG) and ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG), through their Joint
    Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC)

  * HEVC is also known as ISO/IEC 23008-2 MPEG-H Part 2 and ITU-T H.265

  * HEVC provides superior video quality and up to twice the data compression
    as the previous standard (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC)

  * HEVC can support 8K Ultra High Definition video, with a picture size up to
    8192x4320 pixels
