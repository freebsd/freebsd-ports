WARNING: libbacon relies on the Common Access Method user library. If you have
an ATAPI drive, you've got to install the CAM XPT module (atapicam) otherwise
your drive will never be detected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Addtionally, to use OGMRip as a user, you should grant such user specific
permissions on some devices.  You may for example add the following lines into
/etc/devfs.conf:

perm	cd0	0660
perm	pass0	0660
perm	xpt0	0660

(device numbers may vary depending on your configuration)

Any user from the "operator" group should then be able to access those devices
and use OGMRip.
