Hardware-accelerated video and audio decoding for PyTorch.

TorchCodec is a library that provides fast and easy-to-use tools for
decoding video and audio directly into PyTorch tensors. It uses FFmpeg
as a backend and is optimized for performance, with support for
hardware acceleration. This makes it ideal for machine learning pipelines
that process large amounts of video and audio data.
