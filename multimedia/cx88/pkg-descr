cx88 provides drivers for PCI and PCI-e TV/radio capture
cards based on the Conexant CX23880/1/2/3 and CX23885/7/8 
chip families.  This port includes the cx88 kernel drivers
as well as a simple app for TV capture. It requires 
multimedia/libtuner for channel selection and peripheral
configuration.
