Poe: A Pugnacious Ogg Editor. Poe is a vorbis comment editor. It tries to
 follow the vorbis comment header specification closely, while being convenient
 and flexible to use. Towards that end, it doesn't have a static 'form' style
 interface. Instead, it has an editable table of comments. The contents of the
 table change dependent upon preference settings, and what comments are in the
 ogg file you are editing.
