Imagine you captured a nice video with your camcorder, compact camera
or even cell phone while skiing, cycling or whatever sports, and the
video is basically just jiggled. Modern cameras come along with
hardware stabilization, however this does not work if you have really
strong vibrations - rather the contrary, sometimes this mechanisms
start to oscillate. Vid.Stab is your friend in this matter. It is
designed to stabilize even strongly jiggled clips.
