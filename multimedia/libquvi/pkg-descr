quvi is a command line tool for parsing flash media stream URLs. It supports
many websites including YouTube and Dailymotion.

Starting from 0.4.0, the quvi distribution has split into libquvi-scripts,
libquvi and quvi.

libquvi is a cross-platform library for parsing flash media stream URLs with C
API.

libquvi originates from the idea of allowing users to view the videos without
having to install or use flash. It is a "workaround", not an "alternative" to
flash.
