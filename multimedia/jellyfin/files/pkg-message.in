  message: <<EOM

jellyfin relies on Microsoft dotNET5+ SDK to be built
Microsoft does not have an official version of dotNET for FreeBSD

This package was built with an UNOFFICIAL UNSUPPORTED version of dotNET
If this is something that you do not want, remove this package with
"pkg remove jellyfin"

This package installs a service file. 
Enable it with "service jellyfin enable"
Start it with "service jellyfin start".

The service file uses daemon to restart jellyfin if it crashes.
The service file will also change the permissions so that the updater works.
If this behavior is unwanted you will need to edit the RC file manually and
remove the daemon and/or the permissions changes.

If you are running this in a jail please set "allow.mlock" or similar
for this jail otherwise the program will fail to start.

dotNET does not work well inside jails that are missing either a) VNET or 
b) ip6=inherit. The service file will try workaround any user misconfiguration 
but is not perfect.
