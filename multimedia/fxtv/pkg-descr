Fxtv is an X11-based FreeBSD app that provides TV-in-a-window and
image/audio/video capture capabilities for Brooktree Bt848/849/878/879
and Pinnacle PCTV tuner/capture cards.

To use this app, you need a capture card supported by the bktr(4) driver.
Examples include the Hauppauge Wincast/TV, the STB TV PCI, and the
Intel Smart Video Recorder III. See the 'bktr' man page
for more information.
