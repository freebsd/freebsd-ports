Fxtv is an X11-based FreeBSD app that provides TV-in-a-window and
image/audio/video capture capabilities for Bt848/878-based tuner/capture
cards.

To use this app, you need a capture card based on the Brooktree 848/878 chip.
Examples include the Hauppauge Wincast/TV, the STB TV PCI, and the
Intel Smart Video Recorder III. See the 'bktr' man page
for more information.
