OpenShot Video Editor is a program designed to create videos on
Linux.  It can easily combine multiple video clips, audio clips,
and images into a single project, and then export the video into
many common video formats.

OpenShot is a non-linear video editor, which means any frame of
video can be accessed at any time, and thus the video clips can
be layered, mixed, and arranged in very creative ways.  All
video clip edits (trimming, cutting, etc...) are non-destructive,
meaning that the original video clips are never modified.
