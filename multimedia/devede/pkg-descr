DeVeDe is a program to create video DVDs and CDs (VCD, sVCD or CVD),
suitables for home players, from any number of video files, in any of
the formats supported by Mplayer. The big advantage over other utilites
is that it only needs Mplayer, Mencoder, DVDAuthor, VCDImager and
MKisofs (well, and Python 2.4, PyGTK and PyGlade), so its dependencies
are really small.
