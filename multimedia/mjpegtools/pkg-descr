lavtools: Linux Audio and Video TOOLS for Motion JPEG and MPEG
==============================================================

Programs for MJPEG recording and playback and simple cut-and-paste
editting and MPEG compression of audio and video under Linux (Now
FreeBSD).

N.b. Only the "lav" programs have been written whooly from scratch.
The rest are from diverse open source originals, modified to work
with the lav tools edit lists and AVI and quicktime files. Some
(especially the MPEG tools) have had also more major perfomance and
functionality enhancements.
