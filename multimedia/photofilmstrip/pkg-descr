PhotoFilmStrip creates movies out of your pictures in just 3 steps.
First select your photos, customize the motion path and render the
video. There are several output possibilities for VCD, SVCD, DVD

The effect of the slideshow is known as "Ken Burns". Comments of
the pictures are generated into a subtitle file. Furthermore an
audio file can be specified to setup the background musice for the
slide show.
