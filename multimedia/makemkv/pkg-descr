Video converter reading from DVD and Bluray

MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and
patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format
converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from
proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving
most information but not changing it in any way.

Known issues on FreeBSD:

* Only the commandline interface works, so there is no GUI in this port. The
  port includes a small manpage to get you started using makemkvcon.
* makemkvcon always crashes on exit (after completing its job), so be aware
  this might leave core files on your system.
* To find optical drives, makemkvcon uses some entries from Linux' sysfs that
  aren't present on FreeBSD. A script `update-makemkv-drives` is included with
  the port that fakes these entries. It is run automatically on installation,
  but if the system's configuration changes, it must be run manually again by
  root.

Requirements:

* A custom FreeBSD kernel with sg devices (Linux' "scsi generic" interface) is
  required to use makemkvcon. To build such a kernel, add "device sg" to your
  kernel configuration and follow the instructions at
  https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/kernelconfig-building.html
* Make sure you have the "linux" kernel module loaded. On amd64, "linux64" is
  also required.
