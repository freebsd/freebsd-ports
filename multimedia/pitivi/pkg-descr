PiTiVi relies on the GStreamer multimedia framework and the accompanying
plugins to handle the various medias and their transformation. PiTiVi being
a novelty usage of GStreamer, there are some problems with plugins not
handling completely/correctly the GStreamer API. These problems are in
the process of being corrected.

This means that it is not guaranteed that all codecs, containers or effects
work properly with PiTiVi.
