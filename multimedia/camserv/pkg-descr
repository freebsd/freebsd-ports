Camserv is a free program to do streaming video through the web
Streaming video can be sent to both Netscape and Internet Explorer clients.
However, Internet Explorer under Windows cannot apparently handle
the multi-part JPEGs, and therefore a special javascript page must be setup.
One is included in the distribution as an example.

Currently, the only supported BSD device is the bktr driver.
Both tunable modes and camera inputs are supported.
