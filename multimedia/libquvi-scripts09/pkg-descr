quvi is a command line tool for parsing flash media stream URLs. It supports
many websites including YouTube and Dailymotion.

Starting from 0.4.0, the quvi distribution has split into libquvi-scripts,
libquvi and quvi.

libquvi-scripts contains the embedded lua scripts that libquvi uses for parsing
the media details. Some additional utility scripts are also included.
