iso2mkv is software for automated DVD to XviD/vorbis MKV video conversion.
Gives almost total control on the process of video compression at maximum
quality, while being simple and straightforward to use (a kind of
'life-hack'). The intended audience is advanced end-users and the script is
not user-error-proof.

Based on mplayer, mencoder, oggenc or lame, and mkvmerge (if not properly
installed, won't work). This is only a shell script that wraps the other
programs. If you can watch the DVD with MPlayer, you can compress it with
iso2mkv. Other used programs (hopefully included in most GNU/Linux
distributions as well a FreeBSD :) ) are basename, bc, nice, stat.
