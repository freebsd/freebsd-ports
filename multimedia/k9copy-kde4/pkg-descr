K9Copy is a small utility which allows copying DVDs.
The DVD video stream is compressed by the program Vamps.

1. Copy without menus:
Here, dvdauthor creates a new structure for the DVD. It is possible to
arbitrarily set the order of the videos.
2. Copy with menus:
Because dvdauthor can't copy the original menus, K9Copy recreates the original
DVD structure. The menus as well as IFO files are modified to point to the
compressed MPEG2 stream.

Creating personalized menus was not brought back with version 1.0.0
