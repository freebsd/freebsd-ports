[ excerpt from developers' README ]

libdvdplay is an attempt to make a library from ogle dvd navigation
code so that a simple API provides access to both DVD Video data
and DVD information to a reader application.

libdvdplay is a layer over libdvdread. As a consequence it provides
read, seek for DVD media. But it also provides the client application
with a set of access functions needed to create an interface for
the DVD reader (audio, subtitles, titles ...).
