Project X - a free Java based demux utility
Copyright (C) 2001-2004 dvb.matt

European digital radio & television uses the DVB standard to broadcast its
data. Project X gives you a look behind the transmissions and tries its best
to handle & repair many stream types and shows what went wrong on reception.

It is intended for educational purposes only, as a non-commercial test project.
It may not be used otherwise. Most parts are only experimental.
