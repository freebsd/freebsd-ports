From K9copy website:

K9Copy is a small utility which allows the copy of DVD on Linux.
The DVD video stream is compressed by the program Vamps.

1. Copy without menus :
In this case, dvdauthor is used to create a new DVD structure. It is possible
to choose the order in which the video sequences are played.
2. Copy with menus :
As dvdauthor does not make it possible to integrate the original menus,
K9Copy reproduces the original structure of the DVD. The navigation packs as
well as IFO files are modified to point on the compressed MPEG stream.

Features
* The video stream is compressed to make the DVD fit on 4.7 Gb recordable DVD
* DVD Burning
* Creation of ISO images
* Possibility of selecting the audio tracks and subtitles to be copied
* Title preview (video only)
* Possibility of preserving the original menus
