A program that can record programs and games.

Features:
* Graphical user interface (Qt-based).
* Faster than VLC and ffmpeg/avconv.
* Records the entire screen or part of it, or records OpenGL
  applications directly (similar to Fraps on Windows).
* Synchronizes audio and video properly (a common issue with
  VLC and ffmpeg/avconv).
* Reduces the video frame rate if your computer is too slow
  (rather than using up all your RAM like VLC does).
* Fully multithreaded: small delays in any of the components
  will never block the other components, resulting is smoother
  video and better performance on computers with multiple processors.
* Pause and resume recording at any time (either by clicking
  a button or by pressing a hotkey).
* Shows statistics during recording (file size, bit rate, total
  recording time, actual frame rate, ...).
* Can show a preview during recording, so you don't waste time
  recording something only to figure out afterwards that some setting was wrong.
* Supports many different codecs and file formats (adding more is trivial).
* Can also do live streaming (experimental).
