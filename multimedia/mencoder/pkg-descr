The "mencoder" component of the MPlayer project is a tool which
allows creation of video streams. It supports almost the same set
of input sources as the player component and supports encoding from
these sources through various codecs, including the popular ffmpeg,
XviD and x264 families. "Transcoding" DVDs into avi files is also
possible.
