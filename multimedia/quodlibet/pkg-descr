Quod Libet is a GTK+-based audio player written in Python, using the
Mutagen tagging library. It's designed around the idea that you know
how to organize your music better than we do. It lets you make playlists
based on regular expressions (don't worry, regular searches work too).
It lets you display and edit any tags you want in the file. And it
lets you do this for all the file formats it supports -- Ogg Vorbis,
FLAC, MP3, Musepack, and MOD.
