Emby Server uses FFmpeg for transcoding and ImageMagick for
generating thumbnails. The default ports/pkg builds of FFmpeg
and ImageMagick on FreeBSD have a number of options which
could be SET/UNSET to improve your Emby Server experience.

It is recommended to recompile the multimedia/ffmpeg package
from ports with the following options ENABLED (SET):
 - ASS (required for subtitle rendering)
 - LAME (required for mp3 audio transcoding, disabled by default due to mp3 licensing restrictions)
 - OPUS (required for opus audio codec support)
 - X265 (required for H.265 video codec support

It is recommended to recompile the graphics/ImageMagick package
from ports with the following options DISABLED (UNSET):
 - 16BIT_PIXEL (to increase thumbnail generation performance)

If you had mediabrowser installed before the project was
renamed to emby-server, you may want to rename the user and
group (note that moving the database is not supported):
# pw groupmod 989 -n mediabrowser -l emby
# pw usermod 989 -n mediabrowser -l emby -g emby -c Emby\ Server

To automatically start Emby Server at boot time:
# echo 'emby_server_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf

To then manually start Emby Server without rebooting:
# service emby-server start

Once started, visit the following webpage to configure:
http://localhost:8096/
