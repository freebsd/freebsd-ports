It is recommended to recompile this port from source
with the LAME option enabled to support mp3 transcoding.

If you had mediabrowser installed before the project was
renamed to emby-server, you may want to rename the user and
group (note that moving the database is not supported):
# pw groupmod 989 -n mediabrowser -l emby
# pw usermod 989 -n mediabrowser -l emby -g emby -c Emby\ Server

To automatically start Emby Server at boot time:
# echo 'emby_server_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf

To then manually start Emby Server without rebooting:
# service emby-server start

Once started, visit the following webpage to configure:
http://localhost:8096/
