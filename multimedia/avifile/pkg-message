	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

If you're running FreeBSD 4.x, this port requires
a kernel built with the directive:

options USER_LDT

Please, check the FreeBSD Handbook for instructions
on building a custom kernel. If you do not know
where to find it, check the FreeBSD website
http://www.FreeBSD.org/

ALSO, remove ~/.avirc configuration file
prior to running avifile. The newer version
has problems with old configuration files.
