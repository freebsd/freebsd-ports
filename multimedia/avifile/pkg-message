	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

This port requires a kernel built with
the directive:

options USER_LDT

Please, check the FreeBSD Handbook for instructions
on building a custom kernel. If you do not know
where to find it, check the FreeBSD website
http://www.freebsd.org/

Also, if the port finished building but
did not install the aviplay program. You
should consider installing the very
latest qt library supporting threads.
Version 2.2.3 and over should be
enough. Then, try rebuilding the avifile
port.

Please, check the FreeBSD Handbook on
updating your port tree if you need to.

ALSO, remove ~/.avirc configuration file
prior to running avifile. The newer version
has problems with old configuration files.
