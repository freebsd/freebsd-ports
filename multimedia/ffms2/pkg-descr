FFmpegSource (usually known as FFMS or FFMS2) is a cross-platform
wrapper library around FFmpeg/libav. It gives you an easy, convenient
way to say "open and decompress this media file for me, I don't care
how you do it" and get frame- and sample-accurate access (usually),
without having to bother with the sometimes less than straightforward
and less than perfectly documented libav API.
