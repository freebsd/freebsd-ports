libde265 is an open source implementation of the h.265 video codec. It is
written from scratch and has a plain C API to enable a simple integration
into other software.

libde265 supports WPP and tile-based multithreading and includes SSE
optimizations. The decoder includes all features of the Main profile
and correctly decodes almost all conformance streams.
