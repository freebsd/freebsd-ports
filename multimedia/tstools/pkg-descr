MPEG TS/PS/ES Transport, Program and Elementary Stream tools

This is a set of cross-platform command line tools for working with
MPEG data.  The emphasis is on relatively simple tools which
concentrate on MPEG (H.264 and H.262) data packaged according to
H.222 (i.e., TS or PS), with a particular interest in checking for
conformance.  Transport Stream (TS) is typically used for distribution
of cable and satellite data. Program Stream (PS) is typically used
to store data on DVDs.

The tools are focussed on:

    * Quick reporting of useful data (tsinfo, stream_type)
    * Giving a quick overview of the entities in the stream
      (esdots, psdots)
    * Reporting on TS packets (tsreport) or ES units/frames/
      fields (esreport)
    * Simple manipulation of stream data (es2ts, esfilter,
      esreverse, esmerge, ts2es)
    * Streaming of data, possibly with introduced errors
      (tsplay)
