Av1an is a cross-platform framework to streamline encoding, providing
an easy way to start using AV1 / HEVC / H264 / VP9 / VP8 encoding.
AOM, RAV1E, SVT-AV1, VPX, x265, x264 are supported.

## Main Features

Splitting video by scenes for parallel encoding because AV1 encoders
are currently not very good at multithreading and encoding is limited
to a very limited number of threads.

- Vapoursynth script input support.
- Speed up video encoding.
- Target Quality mode. Targeting end result reference visual quality.
  VMAF used as a substructure
- Resuming encoding without loss of encoded progress.
- Simple and clean console look.
- Automatic detection of the number of workers the host can handle.
- Both video and audio transcoding.
