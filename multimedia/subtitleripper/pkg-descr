[ excerpt from developer's www site ]

If you want to convert DVD subtitles into text format (e.g. subrip
format) or VobSub format this program could be useful for you.
However, it is only one tiny tool that you need in the process of
producing srt files. This software depends heavily on  transcode
for its input and is therefore part of the transcode package (see
transcode's contrib directory). So, if you want to convert some
subtitles, grap a copy of the lates transcode distribution.

For srt file production the output of this program should be processed
by some OCR software. Currently, I work with  GOCR for this purpose.

For VobSub output no other tools are required.
