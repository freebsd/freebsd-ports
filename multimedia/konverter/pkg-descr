[ excerpt from developer's web site ]

Konverter is a KDE MEncoder frontend for easy video conversions,
scaling and cropping. Just select any common input format and select
your favourite output format, codec and size (cropped or scaled).
It also features videosplitting, videomerging and a preview mode.
Just simple and powerful :-)
