Decord is a reverse procedure of Record. It provides convenient video slicing
methods based on a thin wrapper on top of hardware accelerated video decoders,
e.g.
  FFMPEG/LibAV(Done)
  Nvidia Codecs(Done)
  Intel Codecs

Decord was designed to handle awkward video shuffling experience in order to
provide smooth experiences similar to random image loader for deep learning.

Decord is also able to decode audio from both video and audio files. One can
slice video and audio together to get a synchronized result; hence providing
a one-stop solution for both video and audio decoding.
