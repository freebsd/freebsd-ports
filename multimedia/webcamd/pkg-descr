Webcamd is a daemon that enables use of hundreds of different USB
based webcam and DVB USB devices under the FreeBSD operating
system. The webcam daemon is basically an application which is a port
of Linux USB device drivers into userspace on FreeBSD. The daemon
currently depends on libc, pthreads, libusb and the CUSE kernel
module.
