X11 and Linux framebuffer front-end for VDR.
Plugin displays video and OSD in X/Xv/XvMC/VAAPI/VDPAU window,
Linux framebuffer/DirectFB/vidixfb or DXR3 card.

Support for local and remote frontends.

Built-in image and media player supports playback of most known
media files (avi/mp3/divx/jpeg/...), DVDs and radio/video streams
(http, rtsp, ...) directly from VDR.

FreeBSD Note:  If you want to use VAAPI/VDPAU make sure the ffmpeg
and libxine ports are (re)built with the corresponding knobs turned on!
(make config in their port dirs.)
