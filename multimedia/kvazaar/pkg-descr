The purpose of this academic open-source project is to develop a video
encoder for the emerging High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard.
This Kvazaar HEVC encoder is being developed towards the following goals:

1. Coding efficiency close to HEVC reference encoder (HM)
2. Modular encoder structure to simplify its data flow modeling
3. Efficient support for different parallelization approaches
4. Easy portability to different platforms
5. Optimized encoding speed without sacrificing its coding efficiency,
   modularity, or portability
6. Reduced computation and memory resources without sacrificing its
   coding efficiency, modularity, or portability
7. Excellent software readability and implementation documentation

Achieving these objectives requires encoder with design decisions that
make this open-source encoder unique:

1. The encoder is developed from the scratch (HM used as a reference)
2. The implementation language is platform-independent C
