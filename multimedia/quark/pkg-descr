Quark is an audio player, for geeks, by geeks. It runs in the background
with access provided via a FIFO in the filesystem. It uses Xine-lib
for playing music, and can therefore play any file format supported
by Xine.

Quark comes with a couple front-ends to make it more useful.

	- charm-quark - a CLI interface
	- strange-quark - a GTK System Tray interface
