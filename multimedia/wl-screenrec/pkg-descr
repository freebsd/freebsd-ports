High performance screen recorder for wlroots Wayland.

Uses dma-buf transfers to get surface, and uses the GPU to do both the
pixel format conversion and the encoding, meaning the raw video data
never touches the CPU, leaving it free to run your applications.

System Requirements:
* Wayland compositor supporting the following protocols:
  * wlr-output-management-unstable-v1 (missing in hikari, cagebreak, gamescope)
  * wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1 (missing in gamescope and theseus-ship)
  Known working examples: sway, hyprland, wayfire, labwc.
* VA-API encoding:
  * Intel iGPUs: libva-intel-media-driver or libva-intel-driver
  * AMD/ATI GPUs: mesa-gallium-va
