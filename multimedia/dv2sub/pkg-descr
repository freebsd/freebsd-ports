dv2sub is a simple utility that extracts the date and time of recording from
a dv video file (using libdv) and outputs it as a subtitle file.

It can also display useful information about the dv stream, like video norm
(PAL/NTSC), aspect ratio normal (4:3) or wide (16:9), interlaced or
progressive material, number of audio channels, audio sampling frequency,
number of audio samples, timestamp and recording date & time.
