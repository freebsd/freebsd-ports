[ from developer's readme ]
OQTEncoder is just here to show how simple it is to realize an
encoder using OpenQuicktime... It is simple, new and doesn't have
a lot of functionality but it should soon be better and it's already
usable ;)

Just launch it without options and it will explain you how to use
it ;). Here follows a simple example to encode any mpeg file using
the great program mpeg2dec from Aaron Holzman:

 	mpeg2dec -s -o pgmpipe test.mpg  | oqtencoder -V jpeg test.mov
