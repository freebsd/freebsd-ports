[ excerpt from developer's README ]

libmovtar
---------

has been implemented according to the quicktime4linux API

It supports reading and writing (read/write mode has been prepared,
but is not implemented yet) of MJPEG video in YUV 4:2:2 JPEG with
mono/stereo, 8/16-bit, any sample rate sound.

It supports indexing files (always done when writing a new file,
old (or manually created) movtar files without index are indexed
internally during the opening process).

You can freely jump forwards and backwards between the frames in
an opened file.
