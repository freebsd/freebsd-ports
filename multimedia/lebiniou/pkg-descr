Le Biniou works with music, voice, ambient sounds, whatever acoustic
source you choose.

When you run Le Biniou it gives an evolutionary rendering of the
sound you are playing.

You are given two options to run Le Biniou: You can manage entirely
the sequences and choose your own series of images from the default
library, your colour scales, the kind of alteration you want to apply
or you can let Le Biniou's artificial intelligence run on its own.

Forget the old visualizations you are familiar with, discover a new
multidimensional -spatial and chromatic- way of comprehending music
and sounds for either artistic, recreational or didactic purposes.
