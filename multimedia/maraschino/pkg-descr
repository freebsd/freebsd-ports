I wanted a simple web interface to act as a nice overview/front page for my XBMC HTPC. I couldn't find anything that suited my requirements so I created something myself.

It is free, open-source software. Use and modify it as you wish. If you're a developer and XBMC enthusiast, consider forking it on GitHub and creating something cool. We're all doing this for fun!
