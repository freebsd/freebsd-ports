[ excerpt from developer's site ]

This is a collection of plugins written with the GStreamer framework.
Some features of these plugins are:

- Dynamically loaded plugins provide elements and media types,
  demand-loaded via an XML registry, similar to ld.so.cache
- Element interface handles all known types of sources, filters,
  sinks
- Capabilities system allows verification of element compatibility
  using MIME types and media-specific properties
- Autoplugging uses capabilities system to complete complex paths
  automatically
- Pipelines can be saved to XML and loaded back to working state
- Resource friendly plugins don't waste RAM
