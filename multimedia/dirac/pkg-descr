Dirac is a prototype video codec, under development by BBC R&D, and initially
released in March 2003.

Dirac is a general-purpose video codec aimed at resolutions from QCIF
(180x144) to HDTV (1920x1080) progressive or interlaced. It uses wavelets,
motion compensation and arithmetic coding and aims to be competitive with
other state of the art codecs.
