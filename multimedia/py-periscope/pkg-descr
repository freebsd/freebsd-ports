periscope is a subtitles searching module written in python that
tries to find a correct match for a given video file. The goal
behind periscope is that it will only return only correct subtitles
so that you can simply relax and enjoy your video without having
to double-check that the subtitles match your video before watching
it. This is done by using as much info as available from your file
and on the websites. Some websites allow you to use hash of the
files, the size/length of the video or the exact file name.

As a python module, periscope should be easily integrated in many
projects that allow plugins to be written in python. The fact that
the plugin is shared between all the applications means that separate
application and their plugin (file browser, video player, media
center application, ...) don't have to maintain the code to search,
parse and download subtitles and the user preference about languages.

The subtitles websites are handled as plugins.
