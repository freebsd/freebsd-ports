cclive is a lightweight command line video extraction tool for Youtube and
other similar video websites. It is a rewrite of the clive software in C++
with lower system footprint and fewer dependencies.

cclive is primarily a "video download tool" but it can also be used along side
with video player software, like "mplayer", for viewing streamed videos instead
of the Adobe flash player.
