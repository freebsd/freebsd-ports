The sarge package provides a wrapper for subprocess which provides command
pipeline functionality.

This package leverages subprocess to provide easy-to-use cross-platform command
pipelines with a Posix flavour: you can have chains of commands using ;, &,
pipes using | and |&, and redirection.

The latest version of sarge can be found on BitBucket:
