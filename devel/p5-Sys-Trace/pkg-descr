Sys::Trace provides a way to programmatically run or trace a program
and see the system calls it makes.

This can be useful during testing as a way to ensure a particular file
is actually opened, or another hard to test interaction actually occurs.

Currently supported tracing mechanisms are ktrace, strace and truss.
