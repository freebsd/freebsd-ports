Data::Serializable is a Moose-based role that enables the consumer to easily
serialize/deserialize data structures. The default serializer is Storable, but
any serializer in the Data::Serializer hierarchy can be used automatically. You
can even install your own custom serializer if the pre-defined ones are not
useful for you.
