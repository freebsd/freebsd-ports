Sublime Merge is a Graphical Git Client from the creators of Sublime Text.
It is powered by the same performant cross-platform GUI toolkit and syntax
highlighting engine used in Sublime Text. Sublime Merge wraps around the
core Git functionality, so when you're using Sublime Merge, you're using Git.
