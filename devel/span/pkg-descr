This repository contains a single-header implementation of C++20's std::span,
conforming to the C++20 committee draft. It is compatible with C++11, but will
use newer language features if they are available.

It differs from the implementation in the Microsoft GSL in that it is
single-header and does not depend on any other GSL facilities. It also works
with C++11, while the GSL version requires C++14.
