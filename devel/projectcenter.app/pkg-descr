Project Center is GNUstep's graphical integrated developement environment
(IDE). It helps you to create all different kinds of projects like
Applications, Tools, Libraries and Bundles.

Project Center allows you to easily add and remove, edit and search files;
writes the project makefiles accordingly and supports you in the actual
process of building and debugging your project.

Even the management of a big project keeps being easy as Project Center's
file browser lets you always have a well sorted and categorized overview
over all the files in your project.
