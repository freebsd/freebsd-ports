mmh3 is a Python extension for MurmurHash (MurmurHash3), a set of fast and
robust non-cryptographic hash functions invented by Austin Appleby.

Combined with probabilistic techniques like a Bloom filter, MinHash, and feature
hashing, mmh3 allows you to develop high-performance systems in fields such as
data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Another common use of mmh3 is to calculate favicon hashes used by Shodan, the
world's first IoT search engine.
