Algorithm::Cron - abstract implementation of the cron(8) scheduling algorithm

Objects in this class implement a time scheduling algorithm such as used by
cron(8). Objects are stateless once constructed, and represent a single schedule
 as defined by a crontab(5) entry. The object implements a method next_time
which returns an epoch timestamp value to indicate the next time included
in the crontab schedule.
