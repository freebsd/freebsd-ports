Provides the opposite of the 'tied' function.  Say you have %hash that
is tied to $object.  Then, it is relatively simple to get $object from
%hash simply by saying

 $object = tied %hash;

But, how does one go the other way?  Simple, with Tie::Restore

 tie %hash, 'Tie::Restore', $object;

Works for any kind of tie. (scalar, array, hash, filehandle)
