This set of scripts allows to work locally on Subversion-managed
projects using the Mercurial distributed version control system.

Why use Mercurial? You can do local (disconnected) work, pull the
latest changes from the SVN server, manage private branches, submit
patches to project maintainers, etc.  And of course you have fast
local operations like "hg log", "hg annotate"...

Currenly two scripts are provided:

 * hgimportsvn initializes an SVN checkout which is also a
   Mercurial repository.
 * hgpullsvn pulls the latest changes from the SVN repository,
   and updates the Mercurial repository accordingly.  It can
   be run multiple times.
