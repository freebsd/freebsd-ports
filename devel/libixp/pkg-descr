libixp is a stand-alone client/server 9P library including ixpc client
which behaves like wmiir in the past.  It consists of less than 2000
lines of code (including ixpc).

libixp's server API is based heavily on that of Plan 9's lib9p, and the
two libraries export virtually identical data structures.
