Odfpy aims to be a complete API for OpenDocument in Python. Unlike other more
convenient APIs, this one is essentially an abstraction layer just above the
XML format. The main focus has been to prevent the programmer from creating
invalid documents. It has checks that raise an exception if the programmer adds
an invalid element, adds an attribute unknown to the grammar, forgets to add
a required attribute or adds text to an element that doesn't allow it.
