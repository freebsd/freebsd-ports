Airspeed is a powerful and easy-to-use templating engine for Python that aims
for a high level of compatibility with the popular Velocity library for Java.

Selling points:
- Compatible with Velocity templates
- Compatible with Python 2.7 and greater, including Jython
- Features include macros definitions, conditionals, sub-templates and much more
- Airspeed is already being put to serious use
- Comprehensive set of unit tests; the entire library was written test-first
- Reasonably fast
- A single Python module of a few kilobytes, and not the 500kb of Velocity
- Liberal licence (BSD-style)
