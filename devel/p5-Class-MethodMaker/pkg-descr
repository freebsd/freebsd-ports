from the readme:

This module solves the problem of having to write a bazillion get/set
methods that are all the same. The argument to 'use' is a hash whose keys
are the names of types of generic methods generated by MethodMaker and
whose values tell method maker what methods to make. (More precisely, the
keys are the names of MethodMaker methods (methods that write methods) and
the values are the arguments to those methods.
