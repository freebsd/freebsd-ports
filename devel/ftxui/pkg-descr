FTXUI is a simple C++ library for terminal based user interfaces.

Feature:
* Functional style. Inspired by [1] and React
* Simple and elegant syntax (in my opinion)
* Keyboard & mouse navigation.
* Support for UTF8 and fullwidth chars
* Support for animations. Demo 1, Demo 2
* Support for drawing. Demo
* No dependencies
* Cross platform: Linux/MacOS (main target), WebAssembly, Windows
* Learn by examples, and tutorials
* Multiple packages: CMake FetchContent (preferred), vcpkg, pkgbuild, conan.
* Good practises: documentation, tests, fuzzers, performance tests, automated
  CI, automated packaging, etc
