conduit is a solution to the streaming data problem, allowing for
production, transformation, and consumption of streams of data in
constant memory.  It is an alternative to lazy I/O which guarantees
deterministic resource handling, and fits in the same general solution
space as enumerator/iteratee and pipes.
