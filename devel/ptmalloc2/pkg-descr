ptmalloc is the original version of the malloc that was later included
in GNU libc.  This version is also but *not* exclusively LGPL:

This package comes with no documentation beyond a README, which isn't
worth installing.  It appears that the GNU libc man page malloc(3)
applies, but it's not included here for copyright reasons.
