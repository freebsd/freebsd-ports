TBOX is a glib-like cross-platform C library that is simple to use yet
powerful in nature.

The project focuses on making C development easier and provides many
modules (.e.g stream, coroutine, regex, container, algorithm ...), so
that any developer can quickly pick it up and enjoy the productivity
boost when developing in C language.
