cvsstat is a perl program which transforms the 'cvs status' output
to an ASCII table sorted after the status of files.  If you have
used CVS, then you know that it is hard to get a good overview the
CVS-status of the files in you directories. Any new files? Any files
changed? Any files which other people have changed in the repository?
cvsstat will help the programmer get the overview.  The program can
be used for any type of CVS archive, local as well as remote.
