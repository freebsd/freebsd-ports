This is a small ruby library that allows Ruby to 'tail' a file,
including following a file, that still is growing like the unix
command 'tail -f' can.

This Library is similar to Perl's File::Tail. It can be used to
extend Ruby's File-objects, for File-derived classes, or by
using the included simple File::Tail::Logfile class.
