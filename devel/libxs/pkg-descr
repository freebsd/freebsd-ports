Crossroads I/O ("libxs") is a library for building scalable and high
performance distributed applications.  It fits between classic BSD sockets,
JMS/AMQP-style message queues, and enterprise message-oriented middleware.

Crossroads I/O extends the standard socket interfaces with features
traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products,
providing an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging
patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple
transport protocols, and more.

Crossroads I/O provides a native C API for applications.  Support for many
more languages is provided by the community through language bindings which
can be found at the Crossroads website.
