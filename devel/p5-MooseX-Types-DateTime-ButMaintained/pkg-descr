This module packages several Moose::Util::TypeConstraints with
coercions, designed to work with the DateTime suite of objects.

This module is just the MooseX::Types::DateTime without the requirement
on DateTimeX::Easy (which requires DateTime::Manip). As of 0.05
this module supports globally unique Olson abbreviations, and dies
when they are not globally unique.
