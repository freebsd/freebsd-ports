This module is a first crack at providing a consistent interface to
Unix (and maybe other multitasking OS's) process table information.
The impetus for this came about with my frustration at having to parse
the output of various systems' ps commands to check whether specific
processes were running on different boxes at a large mixed Unix site.
The output format of ps was different on each OS, and sometimes
changed with each new release of an OS. Also, running a ps subprocess
from within a perl or shell script and parsing the output was not a
very efficient or aesthetic way to do things.

With this module, you can do things like this:

        # kill memory pigs
        use Proc::ProcessTable;

        $t = new Proc::ProcessTable;
        foreach $p ( @{$t->table} ){
          if( $p->pctmem > 95 ){
            $p->kill(9);
          }
        }
