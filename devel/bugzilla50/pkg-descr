Bugzilla is one example of a class of programs called "Defect Tracking
Systems", or, more commonly, "Bug-Tracking Systems". Defect Tracking
Systems allow individual or groups of developers to keep track of
outstanding bugs in their product effectively.

Bugzilla has matured immensely, and now boasts many advanced features.
These include:

  * integrated, product-based granular security schema
  * inter-bug dependencies and dependency graphing
  * advanced reporting capabilities
  * a robust, stable RDBMS back-end
  * extensive configurability
  * a very well-understood and well-thought-out natural bug resolution
    protocol
  * email, XML, console, and HTTP APIs
  * available integration with automated software configuration
    management systems, including Perforce and CVS (through the
    Bugzilla email interface and checkin/checkout scripts)
  * too many more features to list
