dbus-deviation is a project for parsing D-Bus introspection XML and processing
it in various ways. Its main tool is dbus-interface-diff, which calculates the
difference between two D-Bus APIs for the purpose of checking for API breaks.
This functionality is also available as a Python module, dbusdeviation.

A second Python module, dbusapi, is provided for parsing D-Bus introspection XML
to produce an AST representing a D-Bus interface.
