Uproot is a library for reading and writing ROOT files in pure Python and NumPy.

Unlike the standard C++ ROOT implementation, Uproot is only an I/O library,
primarily intended to stream data into machine learning libraries in Python.
Unlike PyROOT and root_numpy, Uproot does not depend on C++ ROOT. Instead, it
uses Numpy to cast blocks of data from the ROOT file as Numpy arrays.
