Valgrind is a system for debugging and profiling un*x programs. With the tools
that come with Valgrind, you can automatically detect many memory management
and threading bugs, avoiding hours of frustrating bug-hunting, making your
programs more stable. You can also perform detailed profiling, to speed up and
reduce memory use of your programs.

The Valgrind distribution includes 10 tools:
 - memcheck, the primary tool, a memory error detector
 - helgrind and drd, thread error detectors
 - callgrind and cachegrind, execution and cache profiling tools
 - massif, a memory tracker
 - dhat, a memory content profiler
 - lackey, an example of using the framework
 - none, does no instumentation and can check that Valgrind runs correctly
 - exp-bbv, and experimental profiling tool using sampling

Valgrind was initially ported to FreeBSD by Doug Rabson.
