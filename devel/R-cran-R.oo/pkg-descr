Methods and classes for object-oriented programming in R with or without
references. Large effort has been made on making definition of methods as simple
as possible with a minimum of maintenance for package developers. The package
has been developed since 2001 and is now considered very stable. This is a
cross-platform package implemented in pure R that defines standard S3 classes
without any tricks.
