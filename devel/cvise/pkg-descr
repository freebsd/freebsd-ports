C-Vise is a tool that takes a large C, C++ or OpenCL program that has a
property of interest (such as triggering a compiler bug) and automatically
produces a much smaller C/C++ or OpenCL program that has the same property. It
is intended for use by people who discover and report bugs in compilers and
other tools that process C/C++ or OpenCL code.
