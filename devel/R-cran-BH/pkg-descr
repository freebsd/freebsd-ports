Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. A
large part of Boost is provided as C++ template code which is
resolved entirely at compile-time without linking. This package
aims to provide the most useful subset of Boost libraries for
template use among CRAN package. By placing these libraries in this
package, we offer a more efficient distribution system for CRAN as
replication of this code in the sources of other packages is avoided.
