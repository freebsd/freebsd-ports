This module defines a standard simplified interface to the dynamic
linking mechanisms available on many platforms.  Its primary purpose is
to implement cheap automatic dynamic loading of Perl modules.

For a more complicated interface, see DynaLoader.  Many (most) features
of DynaLoader are not implemented in XSLoader, like for example the
dl_load_flags, not honored by XSLoader.
