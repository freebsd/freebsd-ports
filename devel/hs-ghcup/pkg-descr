GHCup is the main installer for the general purpose language Haskell.
It provides a command-line interface for installing, managing, and
updating the Haskell toolchain components, including:

- The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)
- The Haskell Build Tool (Cabal-install)
- The Haskell Language Server (HLS)
- Stack
- GHCup itself

GHCup allows users to easily switch between different versions of these
tools and manage sandboxed environments for Haskell development.
