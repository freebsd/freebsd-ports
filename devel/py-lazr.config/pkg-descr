The LAZR config system is typically used to manage process configuration.
Process configuration is for saying how things change when we run
systems on different machines, or under different circumstances.

This system uses ini-like file format of section, keys, and values.
The config file supports inheritance to minimize duplication of
information across files. The format supports schema validation.
