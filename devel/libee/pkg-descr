The core idea of libee is to provide a small but hopefully convenient
API layer above the CEE standard. However, CEE is not finished. At the
time of this writing, CEE is under heavy development and even some of
its core data structures (like the data dictionary and taxonomy) have
not been fully specified. So for the time being, libee should be
thought of as a useful library that helps you get your events
normalized. If you program cleanly to libee, chances are not bad that
only relatively little effort is required to move your app over to be
CEE compliant (once the standard is out).
