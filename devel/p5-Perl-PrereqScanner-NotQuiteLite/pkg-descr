Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite is yet another prerequisites scanner. It
passes almost all the scanning tests for Perl::PrereqScanner and
Module::ExtractUse (ie. except for a few dubious ones), and runs slightly faster
than PPI-based Perl::PrereqScanner. However, it doesn't run as fast as
Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite (which uses an XS lexer).

Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite also recognizes eval. Prerequisites in eval
are not considered as requirements, but you can collect them as suggestions.

Conditional requirements or requirements loaded in a block are treated as
recommends. Noed modules are stored separately (since 0.94). You may or may not
need to merge them into requires.
