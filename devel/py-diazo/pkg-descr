Diazo implements a Deliverance like language using a pure XSLT engine. With
Diazo, you "compile" your theme and ruleset in one step, then use a superfast/
simple transform on each request thereafter. Alternatively, compile your theme
during development, check it into Subversion, and not touch Diazo during
deployment.
