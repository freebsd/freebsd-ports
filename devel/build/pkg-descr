build is a massively-parallel software build system implemented on
top of GNU make. Build is designed with the following tasks in mind:
* configuration
* building
* testing
* installation

Some of its features include:

* position-independent makefiles.
* non-recursive multi-makefile include-based structure.
* leaf makefiles are full-fledged GNU makefiles, not just variable definitions.
* complete dependency graph.
* inter-project dependency tracking.
* extensible language/compiler framework.
