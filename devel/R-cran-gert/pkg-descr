Simple git client for R based on 'libgit2' with support for SSH and
HTTPS remotes. All functions in 'gert' use basic R data types (such
as vectors and data-frames) for their arguments and return values.
User credentials are shared with command line 'git' through the
git-credential store and ssh keys stored on disk or ssh-agent.
