The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design
goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message
size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. It is defined
in IETF RFC 7049.

TinyCBOR is Intel's industrial strength C/C++ implementation of CBOR, as used in
the IoTivity framework.
