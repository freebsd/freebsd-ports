Commitizen is release management tool designed for teams.

Commitizen assumes your team uses a standard way of committing rules and
from that foundation, it can bump your project's version, create the
changelog, and update files.

By default, commitizen uses conventional commits, but you can build your
own set of rules, and publish them.

Using a standardized set of rules to write commits, makes commits easier
to read, and enforces writing descriptive commits.
