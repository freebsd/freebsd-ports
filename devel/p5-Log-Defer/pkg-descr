I believe a lot of log processing is done too early.

This module lets you defer log processing in two ways:

* Defer recording of log messages until some "transaction" has completed

  Typically this transaction is something like an HTTP request or a cron job.
  Generally log messages are easier to read if they are recorded atomically and
  are not intermingled with log messages created by other transactions.

* Defer rendering of log messages

  Sometimes you don't know how logs should be rendered until long after the
  message has been written. If you aren't sure what information you'll want to
  display, or you expect to display the same logs in multiple formats, it makes
  sense to store your logs in a highly structured format so they can be
  reliably parsed and processed later.

This module doesn't actually write out logs! To use this module for normal
logging purposes you also need a logging library.
