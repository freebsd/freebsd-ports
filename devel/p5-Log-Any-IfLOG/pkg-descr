Log::Any::IfLOG will load Log::Any only when LOG environment variable is true.
Otherwise, the module is not loaded and if user imports $log, a dumb object will
be returned instead that will accept any method but return false.

This is a quick-hack solution to avoid the cost of loading Log::Any under
"normal condition" (when LOG is not set to true).
