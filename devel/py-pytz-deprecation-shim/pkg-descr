pytz has served the Python community well for many years, but it is no longer
the best option for providing time zones. pytz has a non-standard interface that
is very easy to misuse; this interface was necessary when pytz was created,
because datetime had no way to represent ambiguous datetimes, but this was
solved in Python 3.6, which added a fold attribute to datetimes in PEP 495. With
the addition of the zoneinfo module in Python 3.9 (PEP 615), there has never
been a better time to migrate away from pytz.

However, since pytz time zones are used very differently from a standard tzinfo,
and many libraries have built pytz zones into their standard time zone interface
(and thus may have users relying on the existence of the localize and normalize
methods); this library provides shim classes that are compatible with both PEP
495 and pytz's interface, to make it easier for libraries to deprecate pytz.
