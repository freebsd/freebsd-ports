aioice is a library for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (RFC 5245) in
Python. It is built on top of asyncio, Python's standard asynchronous I/O
framework.

Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is useful for applications that
establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams, as it facilitates NAT traversal.
Typical usecases include SIP and WebRTC.
