Dulwich is a Python implementation of the Git file formats and protocols,
without the need to have Git installed.

It aims to provide an interface to Git repos (both local and remote) that
does not call out to Git directly but instead uses pure Python. All
functionality is available in pure Python. Optional C extensions can be
built for improved performance.
