Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL
(Corba and Microsoft flavors) and to some extent PHP, C#, and D. It can
generate an on-line class browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference
manual (in LaTeX/PostScript/PDF) from a set of documented source files.
The documentation is extracted directly from the sources.
