The OpenMP subproject of LLVM contains the components required to build an
executable OpenMP program that are outside the compiler itself.

Here you can find :

 * the code for the runtime library against which code compiled by clang
   -fopenmp must be linked before it can run.
 * the library that supports offload to target devices (in "offload")
 * the OpenUH test-suite used to validate the OpenMP runtime
