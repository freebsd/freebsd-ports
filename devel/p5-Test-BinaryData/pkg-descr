Sometimes using Test::More's is test isn't good enough. Its diagnostics may make
it easy to miss differences between strings. By using is_binary instead of is,
the "!" tells us that the lines differ, and we can quickly scan the bytes that
make up the line to see which differ. When comparing very long strings, we can
stop after we've seen a few differences.
