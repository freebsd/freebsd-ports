iaito is the official graphical interface for radare2, a libre reverse
engineering framework.
 * Requires radare2 and Qt-5/6.
 * Iaito was the original name of this GUI before being forked as Cutter.
 * Use r2 plugins (f.ex: no need for r2ghidra-iaito plugin if r2ghidra is
   installed).
 * Focus on simplicity, parity with commands, keybindings and r2-style
   workflows.
 * Aims to cover other radare2 features, not just a disassembler:
   forensics, networking, bindiffing, solvers, ...
