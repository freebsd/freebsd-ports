Use the AI Agents client library to:
- Develop Agents using the Azure AI Agents Service, leveraging an extensive
  ecosystem of models, tools, and capabilities from OpenAI, Microsoft, and other
  LLM providers. The Azure AI Agents Service enables the building of Agents for
  a wide range of generative AI use cases.
- Note: While this package can be used independently, we recommend using the
  Azure AI Projects client library (azure-ai-projects) for an enhanced
  experience. The Projects library provides simplified access to advanced
  functionality, such as creating and managing agents, enumerating AI models,
  working with datasets and managing search indexes, evaluating generative AI
  performance, and enabling OpenTelemetry tracing.
