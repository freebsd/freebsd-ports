p4delta works with a project that is in the Perforce configuration
management system. It lists the local files that have been added,
changed, or deleted. Content differences are summarized, i.e., the
number of lines of code that have been added, changed, and deleted.
It can also add, edit, and remove the appropriate files to/from
Perforce.

Requires ruby.
