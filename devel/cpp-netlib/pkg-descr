cpp-netlib is a collection of network related routines/implementations geared
towards providing a robust cross-platform networking library. cpp-netlib
offers the following implementations:

* Common Message Type -- A generic message type which can be used to
  encapsulate and store message related information, used by all network
  implementations as the primary means of data exchange.

* Network protocol message parsers -- A collection of parsers which generate
  message objects from strings.

* Adapters and Wrappers -- A collection of Adapters and wrappers aimed towards
  making the message type STL friendly.

* Network protocol client and server implementations -- A collection of
  network protocol implementations that include embeddable client and server
  types.
