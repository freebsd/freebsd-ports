PEAR::XML_NITF provides a NITF XML parser. The parser was designed with NITF
version 3.1, but should be forward-compatible when new versions of the NITF DTD
are produced. Various methods for accessing the major elements of the document,
such as the hedline(s), byline, and lede are provided. This class was originally
tested against the Associated Press's (AP) XML data feed.
