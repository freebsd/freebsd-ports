Test::Script::Run exports some subs to help test and run scripts in your
dist's bin/ directory, if the script path is not absolute.

Nearly all the essential code is stolen from Prophet::Test, we think subs
like those should live below Test:: namespace, that's why we packed them
and created this module.
