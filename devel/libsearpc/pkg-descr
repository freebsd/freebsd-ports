Searpc is a simple C language RPC framework based on GObject system.
Searpc handles the serialization/deserialization part of RPC, the
transport part is left to users.

The serialization/deserialization uses JSON format via json-glib
library. A serialized json object is returned from server to client
after executing the RPC function. Each RPC function defined in the
server side should take an extra GError argument to report error.
