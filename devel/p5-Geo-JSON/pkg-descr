Geo::JSON converts to and from geojson using Perl objects. GeoJSON objects
represent various geographical positions - points, lines, polygons, etc.

Currently supports 2 or 3 dimensions (longitude, latitude, altitude). Further
dimensions in positions are ignored for calculations and comparisons, but will
be read-from and written-to.
