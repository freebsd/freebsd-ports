Have you ever tried to debug a test script that is failing tests? Without too
many modifications, your test script can generate a log file with information
about each failed test.

You can take your existing test script, and with (hopefully) very little
effort, convert it to use Test::Debugger. Then re-run your modified test and
view the log file it creates.
