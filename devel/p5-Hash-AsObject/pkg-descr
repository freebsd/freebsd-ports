A Hash::AsObject is a blessed hash that provides read-write access to its
elements using accessors. (Actually, they're both accessors and mutators.)

It's designed to act as much like a plain hash as possible; this means,
for example, that you can use methods like DESTROY and if the Hash::AsObject
has an element with that name, it'll get or set it.
