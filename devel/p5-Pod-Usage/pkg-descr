Pod::Usage provides the function "pod2usage()" to print usage messages for a
Perl script based on its embedded pod documentation. Pod::Usage is a subclass of
Pod::PlainText. Please see the POD documentation for this module (embedded in
the file "Usage.pm") for more details. The pod2usage() function is probably the
most generally useful function in this entire distribution since it is useful to
just about any Perl5 script that is invoked from the command-line.
