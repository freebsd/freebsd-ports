This is a fork of the original airspeed library, with some extensions used in
LocalStack.

Note: This fork of airspeed focuses on providing maximum parity with AWS'
implementation of Velocity templates (used in, e.g., API Gateway or AppSync). In
some cases, the behavior may diverge from the VTL spec, or from the Velocity
reference implementation.
