Turbo Vision for UNIX

Turbo Vision (or TV, for short) is a library that provides an application
framework for C++ programmers.  With TV, you can write beautiful
object-oriented character-mode user interfaces in very a short time.

TV is available in C++ and Pascal and is a product of Borland International.
It was developed to run on MS-DOS systems, but today it is available for many
other platforms (ported by independent programmers).

This port is based on the Borland 2.0 version with fixes.

Borland has released the source code to the public some time ago (take a look
at the COPYRIGHT file in the source package for more information).
