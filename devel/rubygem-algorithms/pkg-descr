algorithms started as a Google Summer of Code 2008 project.

The original proposal is as follows:
Using the right data structure or algorithm for the situation is an important
aspect of programming. In computer science literature, many data structures and
algorithms have been researched and extensively documented. However, there is
still no standard library in Ruby implementing useful structures and algorithms
like Red/Black Trees, tries, different sorting algorithms, etc. This project
will create such a library with documentation on when to use a particular
structure/algorithm. It will also come with a benchmark suite to compare
performance in different situations.
