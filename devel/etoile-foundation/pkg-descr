EtoileFoundation is the core framework for all Etoile projects, providing
numerous convenience methods on top of the OpenStep foundation and
significantly better support for reflection. Here is a summary of some the
interesting features:
- mixins and traits
- restartable exceptions
- collection class protocol and additions
- UUID
- convenient macros such as FOREACH
- dynamic C array

Two sub-frameworks are bundled with it:
- *EtoileThread* which allows objects to transparently be run
  in a separate thread.
- *EtoileXML* which is a light-weight and tolerant XML parsing framework
  whose main ability is to handle truncated and not well-formed XML documents.
  For example, with XML streams used by the XMPP protocol, the XML is received
  in fragments.
