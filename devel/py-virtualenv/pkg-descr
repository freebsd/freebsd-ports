``virtualenv`` is a tool to create isolated Python environments.

It creates an environment that has its own installation directories,
that doesn't share libraries with other virtualenv environments
(and optionally doesn't use the globally installed libraries either).

Usage: virtualenv YOUR_NEW_PYTHON_ENV
