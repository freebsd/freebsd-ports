Merve is a fast C++ lexer for extracting named exports from CommonJS modules.
This library performs static analysis to detect CommonJS export patterns without
executing the code.

Features:
- Fast: Zero-copy parsing for most exports using std::string_view
- Accurate: Handles complex CommonJS patterns including re-exports,
  Object.defineProperty, and transpiler output
- Source Locations: Each export includes a 1-based line number for tooling
  integration
- Unicode Support: Properly unescapes JavaScript string literals including
  \u{XXXX} and surrogate pairs
- Optional SIMD Acceleration: Can use simdutf for faster string operations
- No Dependencies: Single-header distribution available (simdutf is optional)
- Cross-Platform: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
