Lazy priority queue is a pure Ruby priority queue which implements a lazy
binomial heap. It supports the change priority operation, being suitable for
algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path and Prim's minimum spanning tree. It
can be instantiated as a min-priority queue as well as a max-priority queue.
