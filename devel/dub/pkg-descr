DUB emerged as a more general replacement for vibe.d's package manager. It does 
not imply a dependency to vibe.d for packages and was extended to not only 
directly build projects, but also to generate project files (currently VisualD). 

Mono-D also supports the use of dub.json (dub's package description) as the 
project file.

The project's philosophy is to keep things as simple as possible. All that is 
needed to make a project a dub package is to write a short dub.json file and 
put the source code into a source subfolder. It can then be registered on the 
public package registry to be made available for everyone. Any dependencies 
specified in dub.json are automatically downloaded and made available to the 
project during the build process.
