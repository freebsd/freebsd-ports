Convert statistical analysis objects from R into tidy data frames,
so that they can more easily be combined, reshaped and otherwise
processed with tools like 'dplyr', 'tidyr' and 'ggplot2'. The package
provides three S3 generics: tidy, which summarizes a model's
statistical findings such as coefficients of a regression; augment,
which adds columns to the original data such as predictions, residuals
and cluster assignments; and glance, which provides a one-row summary
of model-level statistics.
