ZConfig is a general use Python configuration library. It supports a
hierarchical schema-driven configuration model that allows a schema to
specify data conversion routines written in Python. ZConfig's model is
very different from the model support by the ConfigParser module
found in Python's standard library, and is more suitable to
configuration-intensive applications.
