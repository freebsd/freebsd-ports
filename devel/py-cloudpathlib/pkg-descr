cloudpathlib is a Python library with classes that mimic pathlib.Path's
interface for URIs from different cloud storage services.

Why use cloudpathlib?
- Familiar: If you know how to interact with Path, you know how to interact with
  CloudPath. All of the cloud-relevant Path methods are implemented.
- Supported clouds: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage are
  implemented. FTP is on the way.
- Extensible: The base classes do most of the work generically, so implementing
  two small classes MyPath and MyClient is all you need to add support for a new
  cloud storage service.
- Read/write support: Reading just works. Using the write_text, write_bytes or
  .open('w') methods will all upload your changes to cloud storage without any
  additional file management as a developer.
- Seamless caching: Files are downloaded locally only when necessary. You can
  also easily pass a persistent cache folder so that across processes and
  sessions you only re-download what is necessary.
- Tested: Comprehensive test suite and code coverage.
- Testability: Local filesystem implementations that can be used to easily mock
  cloud storage in your unit tests.
