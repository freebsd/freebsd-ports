TIJmp is a memory profiler for java. TIJmp is made for java/6 and later, it
will not work on java/5 systems. If you need a profiler for java/5 or earlier
try the jmp profiler.

TIJmp is written to be fast and have a small footprint, both memory- and cpu-
wise. This means that the jvm will run at almost full speed, until you use
tijmp to find some information.

TIJmp uses C code to talk to the jvm and it uses swing to show the the tables
of information. So tijmp is written in C (using jvmti and jni) and Java.

TIJmp runs in the same jvm as the program being profiled. This means that it
can easily get access to all things jvmti/jni has to offer.
