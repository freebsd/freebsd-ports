The ParagraphLayout object will analyze the text into runs of text in
the same font, script and direction, and will create a LayoutEngine
object for each run. The LayoutEngine will transform the characters into
glyph codes in visual order.

Clients can use this to break a paragraph into lines, and to display the
glyphs in each line.
