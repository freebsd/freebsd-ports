What is it?
-----------
NAnt is a .NET-based build tool. In theory it is kind of like make without
make's wrinkles. In practice it's a lot like Ant.
If you are not familiar with Jakarta Ant, you can get more information at the
Ant project web site (http://ant.apache.org/).

Why NAnt?
---------
Because Ant was too Java-specific.
Because Ant needed the Java runtime. NAnt only needs the .NET or Mono runtime.
