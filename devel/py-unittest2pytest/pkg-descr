unittest2pytest is a tool that helps rewriting Python unittest
test-cases into pytest test-cases.

In contrast to other similar tools, this unittest2pytest

* handles keyword arguments,
* handles single-line test-cases and several tests on one line,
* uses context-handlers where appropriate.

This is done by using lib2to3 and Python's mighty inspect module.
