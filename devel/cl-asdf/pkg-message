To use asdf and depending ports, you will have to configure your
Lisp systems so they know where to find asdf itself and the system
definition files.

A default configuration is installed in

  ${PREFIX}/etc/asdf-init.lisp

Review this file for further information, or simply load it from your
Lisp initialization file.
