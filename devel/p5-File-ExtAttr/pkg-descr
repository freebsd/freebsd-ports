File::ExtAttr is a Perl module providing access to the extended
attributes of the files.

Extended attributes are metadata associated with a file. Examples are
access control lists (ACLs) and other security parameters. But users can
add their own key=value pairs.

Extended attributes are supported by FreeBSD starting from version 5.
