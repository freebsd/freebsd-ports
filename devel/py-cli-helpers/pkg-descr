CLI Helpers is a Python package that makes it easy to perform common tasks when
building command-line apps. It’s a helper library for command-line interfaces.

Libraries like Click and Python Prompt Toolkit are amazing tools that help you
create quality apps. CLI Helpers complements these libraries by wrapping up
common tasks in simple interfaces.

CLI Helpers is not focused on your app’s design pattern or framework – you can
use it on its own or in combination with other libraries. It’s lightweight and
easy to extend.
