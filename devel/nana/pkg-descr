Nana provides improved support for assertion checking and logging in C, C++ 
using GDB. In particular it provides:

	o Operations can be implemented directly in C or by generating 
	  debugger commands which do the checking and logging only if the 
	  application is run under the debugger. The debugger based calls
	  require are very space efficient (0 or 1 bytes per call). 
	o Support for checking real time constraints.
	o Support for assertion (invariant checking) including:
		+ Space and time efficient (at least versus <assert.h>)
		  For example: assert(i>=0) uses 53 bytes on a i386 vs 
		  an optimised nana call which uses 10 bytes per call.
		+ Checking can be turned on or off at compile or run time.
		+ The action taken when an error is detected can be modified 
		  on a global and per/call basis.
	o Support for logging (printf style debugging) including:
		+ Logging can be turned on and off at compile or run time.
		+ Logging to files, processes or circular buffers in memory
		  with optional time stamping.
	o Support for the quantifiers of predicate calculus (forall, exists).
	o Support for before and after state saving and checking (x, x').
