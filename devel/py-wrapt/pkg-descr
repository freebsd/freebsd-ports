The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy for Python,
which can be used as the basis for the construction of function wrappers and
decorator functions.

The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way beyond
existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators preserve
introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The decorators that
can be constructed using this module will work in far more scenarios than
typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent behaviour.
