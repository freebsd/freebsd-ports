An overview of the foundations of the ExtUtils::Builder Plan framework.
Actions are the cornerstone of this framework. They provide an
interface between build tools (e.g. ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build,
...) and building extensions. This allows producing and consuming sides
to be completely independent from each other. It is a flexible
abstraction around pieces of work, this work can be a piece of perl
code, an external command, a mix of those or possibly other things.
