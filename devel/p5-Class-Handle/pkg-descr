Class related functionality in Perl is broken up into a variety of
different modules.  Class::Handle attempts to provide a convenient
object wrapper around the various different types of functions that can
be performed on a class.

Currently, Class::Handle provies what is effectively a combined API from
UNIVERSAL, Class::ISA and Class::Inspector for obtaining information
about a Class, and some additional task methods, such as load to common
tasks relating to classes.
