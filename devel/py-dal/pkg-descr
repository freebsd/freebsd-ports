PyDal is a database abstraction layer for Python.  It provides a DBAPI 2.0
wrapper for DBAPI 2.0 drivers.  Sounds strange, but even drivers that fully
conform to the DBAPI can differ enough to make building database independent
applications difficult.  Two major abstractions handled by PyDal are
paramstyles and datetime objects.  PyDal makes it possible to use the same
paramstyle and datetime types with any module that conforms to DBAPI 2.0.
In addition, paramstyles and datetime types are configurable.
