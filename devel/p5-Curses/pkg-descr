Curses is the interface between Perl and your system's curses(3) library.
For descriptions on the usage of a given function, variable, or constant,
consult your system's documentation, as such information invariably varies
(:-) between different curses(3) libraries and operating systems.  This
document describes the interface itself, and assumes that you already know
how your system's curses(3) library works.
