The package is essentially an implementation of a PageController pattern.

Architecture:
* Controller class that examines HTTP requests and manages form values
  persistence across requests.
* Page class (subclass of QuickForm) representing a single page of the form.
* Business logic is contained in subclasses of Action class.

Cool features:
* Includes several default Actions that allow easy building of multipage forms.
* Includes usage examples for common usage cases (single-page form, wizard,
  tabbed form).
