File::ShareDir::Install allows you to install read-only data files from a
distribution. It is a companion module to File::ShareDir, which allows you to
locate these files after installation.

It is a port Module::Install::Share to ExtUtils::MakeMaker with the improvement
of only installing the files you want; .svn and other source-control junk will
be ignored.
