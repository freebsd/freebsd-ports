GNUstep is a set of general-purpose Objective-C libraries, originally based on
the OpenStep standard jointly developed by NeXT and Sun and now following
Apple's Cocoa APIs. The libraries consist of everything from foundation
classes, such as dictionaries and arrays, to GUI interface classes such as
windows, sliders, buttons, etc.
