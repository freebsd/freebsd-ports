Qt GRPC is the client-side implementation that, together with the Qt
Protobuf module, allows the definition of messages and services in
.proto files, which then use the provided code generators to generate
client code that allows the access for fields and gRPC services in the
Qt framework. The code generated by Qt GRPC enables the client-side to
communicate with a gRPC server (regardless of whether the server uses
Qt) by sending calls or streaming messages.
