Provides functions available in later versions of base to a wider range of
compilers, without requiring you to use CPP pragmas in your code. See the README
for what is covered. Also see the changelog for recent changes.

Note that base-compat does not add any orphan instances. There is a separate
package, base-orphans, for that.

In addition, base-compat does not backport any data types or type classes.
See this section of the README for more info.
