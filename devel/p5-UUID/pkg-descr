The UUID library is used to generate unique identifiers for objects that may be
accessible beyond the local system. For instance, they could be used to generate
unique HTTP cookies across multiple web servers without communication between
the servers, and without fear of a name clash.

The generated UUIDs can be reasonably expected to be unique within a system, and
unique across all systems, and are compatible with those created by the Open
Software Foundation (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE).

All generated UUIDs are either version 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or version 7. And all are
variant 1, meaning compliant with the OSF DCE standard as described in RFC4122.

Versions 6 and 7 are not standardized. They are presented here as proposed in
RFC4122bis, version 14, and may change in the future. RFC4122bis is noted to
replace RFC4122, if approved.
