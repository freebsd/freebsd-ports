Following the release of CPAN::Mini, the CPAN::Mini::Inject module
was created to add additional distributions into a minicpan mirror.

While it was created for use with a minicpan mirror, similar
functionality can be reused in other situations.

CPAN::Inject replicates the basics of this functionality.

Specifically, it takes an arbitrary tarball and adds it to the CPAN
sources directory for a particular author, and then add the new
file to the CHECKSUMS file.
