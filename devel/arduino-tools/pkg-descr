arduino-tools is mostly a meta-port to ensure installation of the tools
required by Arduino 1.6. It does some installation to properly structure
the arduino/tools-builder/ structure in such a way that we may use
all of the tools available from ports while not requiring modifications
to devel/arduino-builder to auto-detect the tools.
