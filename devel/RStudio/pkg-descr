RStudio is a powerful and productive integrated development environment (IDE)
for the R programming language. It includes a console, a syntax-highlighting
editor that supports direct code execution, and a wide range of tools for
plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management.

RStudio is available in two flavors:
- Desktop: A standalone application for your computer (requires X11).
- Server: A web-based interface that provides access to RStudio from anywhere
  with a web browser.

It also features deep integration with Quarto, a next-generation scientific
and technical publishing system.
