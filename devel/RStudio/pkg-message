======================================================================
You installed RStudio: Integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

Please note that RStudio requires /proc to be mounted.

The usual way to do this is to add this line to /etc/fstab:
proc /proc procfs rw 0 0

and then run this command as root:
# mount /proc
