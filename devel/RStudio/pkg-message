  message: <<EOM
You installed RStudio: Integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

Please note that RStudio requires /proc to be mounted.

The usual way to do this is to add this line to /etc/fstab:
proc /proc procfs rw 0 0

and then run this command as root:
# mount /proc

=== Desktop Flavor ===
The desktop flavor provides a native GUI using Electron. Simply run:
% rstudio

=== Server Flavor ===
To enable RStudio Server service at startup:
# sysrc rstudio_server_enable="YES"
# service rstudio-server start

Then navigate to http://localhost:8787/ in your browser.

You can also start the RStudio Server service once with:
# service rstudio-server onestart

=== COPILOT option ===
In order to use this (default) option you need to be
logged into your GitHub copilot account. 

You can log into GitHub copilot using GitHub's CLI gh,
or directly from the GitHub copilot application 'copilot'
installed by misc/github-copilot-cli.

The gh and copilot executables are not required to use the
COPILOT option. You only need one of them to log into your
GitHub account.
