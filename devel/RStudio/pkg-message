You installed RStudio: Integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

Please note that RStudio requires /proc to be mounted.

The usual way to do this is to add this line to /etc/fstab:
proc /proc procfs rw 0 0

and then run this command as root:
# mount /proc

=== Desktop Flavor ===
The desktop flavor provides a native GUI using Electron. Simply run:
% rstudio

=== Server Flavor ===
To enable RStudio Server service at startup:
# sysrc rstudio_server_enable="YES"
# service rstudio-server start

Then navigate to http://localhost:8787/ in your browser.

You can also start the RStudio Server service once with:
# service rstudio-server onestart
