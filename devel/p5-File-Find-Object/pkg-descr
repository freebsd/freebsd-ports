File::Find::Object does same job as File::Find but works like an
object and with an iterator. As File::Find is not object oriented, one
cannot perform multiple searches in the same application. The second
problem of File::Find is its file processing: after starting its main
loop, one cannot easily wait for another event an so get the next
result.

With File::Find::Object you can get the next file by calling the
next() function, but setting a callback is still possible.
