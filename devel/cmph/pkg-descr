CMPH - C Minimal Perfect Hashing Library

A perfect hash function maps a static set of n keys into a set of m integer
numbers without collisions, where m is greater than or equal to n. If m is equal
to n, the function is called minimal.

Minimal perfect hash functions are widely used for memory efficient storage and
fast retrieval of items from static sets, such as words in natural languages,
reserved words in programming languages or interactive systems, universal
resource locations (URLs) in Web search engines, or item sets in data mining
techniques. Therefore, there are applications for minimal perfect hash functions
in information retrieval systems, database systems, language translation
systems, electronic commerce systems, compilers, operating systems, among
others.
