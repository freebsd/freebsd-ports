The intention of the nglogc library is to provide an easy to use and powerful
logging API with mechanism which allows to cram source codes with log
statements at the start of implementation and decide at the level of building
or at runtime which statements should be processed.

Therefore the log statements could be controlled by various log levels and
define switches are available to completely remove the call of the functions at
pre-processor time. So it is possible to switch on the logging only if it is
necessary or only print selected messages without any changes in the source
code. Different publishers are provided also as different formats of outputs to
fulfil the requirements for software development.
