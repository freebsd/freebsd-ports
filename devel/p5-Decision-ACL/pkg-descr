This module's purpose is to provide an already implemented ACL logic for 
programmers. Most of the time writing access control list scripts is long 
and boring. This set of modules has all the convenient logic behind access 
control lists and provide an easy interface to it. It allows you to build 
custom ACL's, and provide the mechanisms to run the ACL against data.
