This module's purpose is to provide an already implemented ACL logic for
programmers. Most of the time writing access control list scripts is long
and boring. This set of modules has all the convenient logic behind access
control lists and provide an easy interface to it. It allows you to build
custom ACL's, and provide the mechanisms to run the ACL against data.
