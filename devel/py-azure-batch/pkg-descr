This is the Microsoft Azure Batch Client Library.

Batch processing began with mainframe computers and punch cards. Today, it still
plays a central role in business, engineering, science, and other areas that
require running lots of automated tasks—processing bills and payroll,
calculating portfolio risk, designing new products, rendering animated films,
testing software, searching for energy, predicting the weather, and finding new
cures for disease. Previously, few people had access to the computing power for
these scenarios. With Azure Batch, that power is available to you when you need
it, without any capital investment.
