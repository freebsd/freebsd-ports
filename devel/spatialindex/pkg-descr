This package provides a general framework for developing spatial indices.
Currently it defines generic interfaces, provides simple main memory and
disk based storage managers and a robust implementation of an R*-tree, an
MVR-tree and a TPR-tree.

Supported Features:
	* Generic main memory and disk based storage managers.
	* R*-tree index (also supports linear and quadratic splitting).
	* MVR-tree index (a.k.a. PPR-tree).
	* TPR-tree index.
	* Advanced query capabilities, using Strategy and Visitor patterns.
	* Arbitrary shaped range queries, by defining generic geometry interfaces.
	* Large parameterization capabilities, including dimensionality,
	  fill factor, node capacity, etc.
	* STR packing / bulk loading.
