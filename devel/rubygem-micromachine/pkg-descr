There are many finite state machine implementations for Ruby, and they all
provide a nice DSL for declaring events, exceptions, callbacks, and all kinds
of niceties in general.

But if all you want is a finite state machine, look no further: this has less
than 50 lines of code and provides everything a finite state machine must have,
and nothing more.
