Many-Core Engine (MCE) for Perl helps enable a new level of performance by
maximizing all available cores. MCE spawns a pool of workers and therefore does
not fork a new process per each element of data. Instead, MCE follows a bank
queuing model. Imagine the line being the data and bank-tellers the parallel
workers. MCE enhances that model by adding the ability to chunk the next n
elements from the input stream to the next available worker.
