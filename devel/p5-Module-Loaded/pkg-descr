When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide 
functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided by 
external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark these 
external modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded by 
perl, this module offers you a very simple way to mark modules as loaded 
and/or unloaded.
