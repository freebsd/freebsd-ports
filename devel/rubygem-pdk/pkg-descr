The Puppet Development Kit (PDK) includes key Puppet code development and
testing tools for Linux, Windows, and OS X workstations, so you can install one
package with the tools you need to create and validate new modules.

PDK includes testing tools, a complete module skeleton, and command line tools
to help you create, validate, and run tests on Puppet modules. PDK also
includes all dependencies needed for its use.
