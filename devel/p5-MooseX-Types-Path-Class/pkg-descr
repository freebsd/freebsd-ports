This is a utility that creates common Moose subtypes, coercions and option
specifications useful for dealing with Path::Class objects as Moose attributes.

This module constructs coercions (see Moose::Util::TypeConstraints) from both
'Str' and 'ArrayRef' to both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File objects.
It also adds the Getopt option type ("=s") for both Path::Class::Dir and
Path::Class::File (see MooseX::Getopt).

This is just meant to be a central place for these constructs, so you don't
have to worry about whether they've been created or not, and you're not tempted
to copy them into yet another class (like I was).
