Unstable development version of the SDL library (linux version).

This library is designed to make it easy to write games that run
on UNIX, Win32 and BeOS using the various native high-performance
media interfaces, (for video, audio, etc) and presenting a single
source-code level API to your application. This is a fairly low
level API, but using this, completely portable applications can be
written with a great deal of flexibility.
