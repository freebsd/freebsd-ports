=== INSTALLATION ===

Artifactory is now installed in %%APP_HOME%%

You may want to activate it in /etc/rc.conf:

  # echo %%APP_NAME%%_enable="YES" >> /etc/rc.conf

Now, start Artifactory:

  # service %%APP_NAME%% start

Once Artifactory is started, point your web browser to:

http://localhost:8081/

Artifactory configuration files are located in %%APP_HOME%%/etc

Please don't forget to review and edit the files in the
%%APP_HOME%%/etc directory to suit your needs.

=== DEINSTALLATION ==

If, when, Artifactory is removed, and you no longer require the
runtime database and configuration files, you can delete the
following directory:

  %%VARDIR%%

Please double-check before removing this directory as it contains
the database files that Artifactory requires if you do decide to
re-install it again.

Enjoy!
