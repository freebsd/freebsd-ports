  message: <<EOM
If, when, Artifactory is removed, and you no longer require the
runtime database and configuration files, you can delete the
following directory:

  %%VARDIR%%

Please double-check before removing this directory as it contains
the database files that Artifactory requires if you do decide to
re-install it again.

Enjoy!
