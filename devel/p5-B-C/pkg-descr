Perl compiler's C backend

This compiler backend takes Perl source and generates C source
code corresponding to the internal structures that perl uses to
run your program. When the generated C source is compiled and
run, it cuts out the time which perl would have taken to load
and parse your program into its internal semi-compiled form.
That means that compiling with this backend will not help improve
the runtime execution speed of your program but may improve
the start-up time. Depending on the environment in which your
program runs this may be either a help or a hindrance.
