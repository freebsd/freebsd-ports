The Lemon  program is an  LALR(1) parser  generator. It takes  a context
free grammar  and converts it into  a subroutine that will  parse a file
using that grammar.

Lemon is  similar to the much  more famous programs "YACC"  and "BISON".
But lemon is not compatible with either yacc or bison. There are several
important differences:

	. Lemon using a different grammar  syntax which is less prone to
	  programming errors.

	. Lemon generates a parser that is faster than Yacc or Bison
	  parsers (according to the author).

	. The parser generated by Lemon is both re-entrant and thread-safe.

	. Lemon includes the concept of a non-terminal destructor, which
	  makes  it much  easier  to write  a parser  that  does not
	  leak memory.
