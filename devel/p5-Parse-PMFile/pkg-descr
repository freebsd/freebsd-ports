The most of the code of this module is taken from the PAUSE code as of
April 2013 almost verbatim.  Thus, the heart of this module should be
quite stable.  However, I made it not to use pipe ("-|") as well as I
stripped database-related code.  If you encounter any issue, that's
most probably because of my modification.

This module doesn't provide features to extract a distribution or
parse meta files intentionally.
