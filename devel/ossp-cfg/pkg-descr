OSSP cfg is a ISO-C library for parsing arbitrary C/C++-style configuration
files. A configuration is sequence of directives. Each directive consists of
zero or more tokens. Each token can be either a string or again a complete
sequence. This means the configuration syntax has a recursive structure and
this way allows to create configurations with arbitrarily nested sections.
