pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python
and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code. Its goals
and syntax are similar to the excellent Boost.Python library by David Abrahams:
to minimize boilerplate code in traditional extension modules by inferring type
information using compile-time introspection.
