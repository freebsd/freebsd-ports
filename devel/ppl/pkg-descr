The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is a modern C++ library for the manipulation
of convex polyhedra. To be more precise, the PPL can handle all the convex
polyhedra that can be defined as the intersection of a finite number of closed
hyperspaces, each described by an equality or a non-strict inequality with
rational coefficients. (More details are available on the PPL's internal
mechanisms.) The Parma Polyhedra Library is:

   - user friendly: you write x + 2*y + 5*z <= 7 when you mean it;
   - fully dynamic: available virtual memory is the only limitation to the
     dimension of anything;
   - written in standard C++: meant to be portable;
   - exception-safe: never leaks resources or leaves invalid object fragments
     around;
   - rather efficient: and we hope to make it even more so;
   - thoroughly documented: perhaps not literate programming but close enough;
   - free software: distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
     License.
