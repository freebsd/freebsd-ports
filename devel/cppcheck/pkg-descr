Cppcheck is a tool for static C/C++ code analysis, and it tries to
detect bugs that your compiler do not see.  Checks for: memory leaks,
mismatching allocation-deallocation, buffer overrun, and many more.

Cppcheck is versatile.  You can check non-standard code that includes
various compiler extensions, inline assembly code, etc.

The goal is no false positives.
