LibGII (General Input Interface) is intended to be to input what our LibGGI
(General Graphics Interface) library is to graphics.

LibGII is based on the concept of input streams, which virtualize access
to the underlying input drivers. Events from various input devices are
abstracted into easy-to-use structures. LibGII also allows the application to
join streams together, receiving input from an arbitrary combination of
devices. LibGII is a separate component from LibGGI, although LibGGI
depends on LibGII for input purposes.

The main purpose of this LibGII release is to accompany our LibGGI
release, but you're still very welcome to use LibGII as a standalone
library for your non-LibGGI applications. Also you might be interested in
the mhub utility found in the demos directory. mhub is a mouse event repeater
and converter. See mhub(1) and the libgii(7) and input-<target>(7) manual pages
for more info.
