The Autodist is a source distribution management system that allows
powerful mechanisms to define what is included in and excluded from a
distribution, and what license the distribution is released under. It is
also used to create the actual distribution source packages. Autodist
allows distribution management in file, directory and file content
level. Autodist is especially targeted for large software projects, and
projects where multiple distributions are created from one source tree.
