The package provides a database of test results which can be used as part of
developer workflow to ensure/check things like:

- No commits without having had a test failure, test fixed cycle.
- No commits without new tests being added.
- What tests have failed since the last commit (to run just a subset).
- What tests are currently failing and need work.

Test results are inserted using subunit (and thus anything that can output
subunit or be converted into a subunit stream can be accepted).
