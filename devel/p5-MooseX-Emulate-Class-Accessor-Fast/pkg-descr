MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast attempts to emulate the behavior
of Class::Accessor::Fast as accurately as possible using the Moose
attribute system.  The public API of Class::Accessor::Fast is wholly
supported, but the private methods are not.  If you are only using the
public methods (as you should) migration should be a matter of switching
your "use base" line to a "with" line.
