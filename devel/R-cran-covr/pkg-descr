Track and report code coverage for your package and (optionally) upload the
results to a coverage service like 'Codecov' <http://codecov.io> or 'Coveralls'
<http://coveralls.io>. Code coverage is a measure of the amount of code being
exercised by a set of tests. It is an indirect measure of test quality and
completeness. This package is compatible with any testing methodology or
framework and tracks coverage of both R code and compiled C/C++/FORTRAN code.
