PhASAR is a LLVM-based static analysis framework written in C++. It allows users
to specify arbitrary data-flow problems which are then solved in a
fully-automated manner on the specified LLVM IR target code. Computing points-to
information, call-graph(s), etc. is done by the framework, thus you can focus on
what matters.
