The GNU Binutils are a collection of binary tools. The main ones are:

* ld - the GNU linker.
* as - the GNU assembler.

Most of these programs use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor library, to do
low-level manipulation. Many of them also use the opcodes library to assemble
and disassemble machine instructions.

This port may be used as a replacement for the system binutils and support
features from the latest versions of GCC.

For cross-compilation, see the devel/cross-binutils port.
