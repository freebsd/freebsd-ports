These are quickie routines that are meant to save a couple
of lines of code over and over again.  They do not do
anything fancy.

read_file() does what you would expect.  If you are using
its output in array context, then it returns an array of
lines.  If you are calling it from scalar context, then
returns the entire file in a single string.

It croaks()s if it can't open the file.

write_file() creates or overwrites files.

append_file() appends to a file.

overwrite_file() does an in-place update of an existing
file or creates a new file if it didn't already exist.

Write_file will also replace a file.  The difference is
that the first that that write_file() does is to trucate
the file whereas the last thing that overwrite_file() is
to trucate the file.  Overwrite_file() should be used in
situations where you have a file that always needs to have
contents, even in the middle of an update.

read_dir() returns all of the entries in a directory
except for "."  and "..".  It croaks if it cannot open the
directory.
