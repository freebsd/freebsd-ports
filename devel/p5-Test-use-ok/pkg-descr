According to the Test::More documentation, it is recommended to run
use_ok() inside a BEGIN block, so functions are exported at
compile-time and prototypes are properly honored.

That is, instead of writing this:

    use_ok( 'Some::Module' );
    use_ok( 'Other::Module' );

One should write this:

    BEGIN { use_ok( 'Some::Module' ); }
    BEGIN { use_ok( 'Other::Module' ); }

However, people often either forget to add BEGIN, or mistakenly group
use_ok with other tests in a single BEGIN block, which can create subtle
differences in execution order.

With this module, simply change all use_ok in test scripts to use ok,
and they will be executed at BEGIN time.  The explicit space after use
makes it clear that this is a single compile-time action.
