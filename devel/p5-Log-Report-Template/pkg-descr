Log::Report::Template extends Template, which is the core of Template Toolkit.
The main addition is support for translations via the translation framework
offered by Log::Report.

You add translations to a template system, by adding calls to some translation
function (by default called loc()) to your template text. That function will
perform dark magic to collect the translation from translation tables, and fill
in values.
