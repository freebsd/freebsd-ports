gettext-setup is a simple gem to set up i18n for Ruby projects (including
Sinatra web apps) using gettext and fast gettext.

This project sets the default locale to English. If the user has set a different
locale in their browser preferences, and we support the user's preferred locale,
strings and data formatting will be customized for that locale.
