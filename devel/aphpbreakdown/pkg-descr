This software analyzes all files of your project and collect all PHP classes,
functions and constants found in your project. For the collection of classes,
functions and constants it determined all modules of PHP needed to be installed
on the webserver for your project.

To display the result of the analyze you can choose different ways. One way is
to display an output on your command line. But what do you do if you don't have
a command line access on the server you want to test?  Then you use the testfile
generator of aPHPbreakdown! It generates a testfile you can upload to the
webserver, or sent it to you customer to upload it, and run it very simple in
the browser.
