PyOpenCL gives you easy, Pythonic access to the OpenCL parallel computation
API.  What makes PyOpenCL special?

- Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called RAII
  in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free code.
- Completeness.  PyOpenCL puts the full power of OpenCL's API at your
  disposal, if you wish.  Every obscure get_info() query and all CL calls
  are accessible.
- Automatic Error Checking.  All errors are automatically translated into
  Python exceptions.
- Speed. PyOpenCL's base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties above
  are virtually free.
- Helpful Documentation.
- Liberal license.  PyOpenCL is open-source under the MIT license and free
  for commercial, academic, and private use.
