This package generates a comprehensive information page for your current
PEAR install.

  * The format for the page is similar to that for phpinfo() except using PEAR
    colors.
  * Has complete PEAR Credits (based on the packages you have installed).
  * Will show if there is a newer version than the one presently installed
    (and what its state is)
  * Each package has an anchor in the form pkg_PackageName - where PackageName
    is a case-sensitive PEAR package name

With a few parameters, the entire package.xml is automatically updated with a
listing of all files in a package.
