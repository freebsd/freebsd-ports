C-Reduce is a tool which takes a large C or C++ program that has a property of
interest (such as triggering a compiler bug) and automatically produces a much
smaller C/C++ program that has the same property. It is intended for use by
people who discover and report bugs in compilers and other tools that process
C/C++ code.
