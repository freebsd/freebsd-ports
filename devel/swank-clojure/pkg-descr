Swank Clojure is a server that allows SLIME (the Superior Lisp
Interaction Mode for Emacs) to connect to Clojure projects.

To use it you must launch a swank server, then connect to it from
within Emacs using M-x slime-connect.

For example:

  (ns user (:use [swank.swank :as swank]))

  (clojure.main/with-bindings
    (swank/ignore-protocol-version "2010-06-04")
    (swank/start-server "/dev/null" :port 4005))

Just replace "user" with your preferred namespace.
