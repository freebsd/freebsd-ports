git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file contents
into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when dealing with
files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due to limitations
in memory, time, or disk space. Even without file content tracking, being
able to manage files with git, move files around and delete files with
versioned directory trees, and use branches and distributed clones, are
all very handy reasons to use git. And annexed files can co-exist in the
same git repository with regularly versioned files, which is convenient
for maintaining documents, Makefiles, etc that are associated with annexed
files but that benefit from full revision control.
