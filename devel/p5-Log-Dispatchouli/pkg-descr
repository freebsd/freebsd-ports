Log::Dispatchouli is a thin layer above Log::Dispatch and meant to
make it dead simple to add logging to a program without having to
think much about categories, facilities, levels, or things like that.
It is meant to make logging just configurable enough that you can find
the logs you want and just easy enough that you will actually log
things.
