Medikit automates keeping your projects' boilerplate files and directory sane
and up to date.

It (optionally) generates and maintains a bunch of files, updating them
according to rules you define.

It's not a dependency. All changes are commited in your source tree.

You write amazing code, Medikit focuses on keeping it clean and ordered.
