Typer is a library for building CLI applications that users will love using and
developers will love creating. Based on Python 3.6+ type hints.

The key features are:
- Intuitive to write: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time
  debugging. Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- Easy to use: It's easy to use for the final users. Automatic help, and
  automatic completion for all shells.
- Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter
  declaration. Fewer bugs.
- Start simple: The simplest example adds only 2 lines of code to your app: 1
  import, 1 function call.
- Grow large: Grow in complexity as much as you want, create arbitrarily complex
  trees of commands and groups of subcommands, with options and arguments.
