Event::RPC supports you in developing Event based networking client/server
applications with transparent object/method access from the client to the
server. Network communication is optionally encrypted using IO::Socket::SSL.
Several event loop managers are supported due to an extensible API. Currently
Event, Glib and AnyEvent are implemented. The latter lets you use nearly every
event loop implementation available for Perl. AnyEvent was invented after
Event::RPC was created and thus Event::RPC started using it's own abstraction
model.
