Raylib is a programming library to learn videogames programming.
It doesn't have a fancy interface, has no visual helpers, and no auto-debugging.
It is created based on the believe that just coding is the best way to learn.

Raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA framework. 
Allegro and SDL have also been used as reference.
