This library is designed to make it easy to write games that run on UNIX,
Win32, MacOS X and other platforms using the various native high-performance
media interfaces (for video, audio, etc) and presenting a single source-code
level API to your application. This is a fairly low level API, but using this,
completely portable applications can be written with a great deal of
flexibility.
