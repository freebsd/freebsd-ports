Python docstring style checker

(formerly pep257)

pydocstyle is a static analysis tool for checking compliance with
Python docstring conventions.

pydocstyle supports most of PEP 257 out of the box, but it should
not be considered a reference implementation.

pydocstyle supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, pypy and pypy3.
