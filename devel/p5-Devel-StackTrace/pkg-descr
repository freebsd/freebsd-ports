The Devel::StackTrace module contains two classes, Devel::StackTrace and
Devel::StackTraceFrame. The goal of this object is to encapsulate the
information that can found through using the caller() function, as well as
providing a simple interface to this data.

The Devel::StackTrace object contains a set of Devel::StackTraceFrame
objects, one for each level of the stack. The frames contain all the data
available from caller() as of Perl 5.6.0 though this module still works
with 5.00503.
