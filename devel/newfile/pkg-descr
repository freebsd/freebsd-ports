Newfile is a tool for creating starter files in various languages.
It uses a full-featured preprocessor (like the C preprocessor) to
transform templates into customized starter files. It can also generate
trees of files for a specific purpose, such as a project using automake
and autoconf, or a FreeBSD port.
