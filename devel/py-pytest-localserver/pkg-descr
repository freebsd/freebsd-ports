pytest-localserver is a plugin for the pytest testing framework which
enables you to test server connections locally.

Sometimes monkeypatching urllib2.urlopen() just does not cut it, for
instance if you work with urllib2.Request, define your own
openers/handlers or work with httplib. In these cases it may come in
handy to have an HTTP server running locally which behaves just like
the real thing. Well, look no further!
