PryRemoteEm enables you to start instances of Pry in a running EventMachine
program and connect to those Pry instances over a network or the Internet.
Once connected you can interact with the internal state of the program.

It's based off of Mon-Ouie's pry-remote for DRb.

It adds user authentication and SSL support along with tab-completion and
paging. It's compatble with MRI 1.9, or any other VM with support for Fibers
and EventMachine.
