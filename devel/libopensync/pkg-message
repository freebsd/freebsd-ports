Think about using a multisync-gui, start by trying to sync your various devices
and applications one by one with a directory; then try to assemble the devices
in the way you want.

Do not disable the syncing of data, as it disables syncing everything.

See http://www.opensync.org/wiki/DeviceCompatibilityList for a list of
compatible devices.
