This is the simple REST client for Cloud Resource Manager API V1. Simple REST
clients are Ruby client libraries that provide access to Google services via
their HTTP REST API endpoints. These libraries are generated and updated
automatically based on the discovery documents published by the service, and
they handle most concerns such as authentication, pagination, retry, timeouts,
and logging. You can use this client to access the Cloud Resource Manager API,
but note that some services may provide a separate modern client that is
easier to use.
