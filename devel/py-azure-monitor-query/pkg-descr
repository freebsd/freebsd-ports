The Azure Monitor Query client library is used to execute read-only queries
against Azure Monitor's Logs data platform.

Logs - Collects and organizes log and performance data from monitored resources.
Data from different sources such as platform logs from Azure services, log and
performance data from virtual machines agents, and usage and performance data
from apps can be consolidated into a single Azure Log Analytics workspace. The
various data types can be analyzed together using the Kusto Query Language.
