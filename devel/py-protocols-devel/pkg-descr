This package builds on the object adaptation protocol presented in PEP
246 to make it easier for component authors, framework suppliers, and
other developers to:

    * Specify what behavior a component requires or provides

    * Specify how to adapt the interface provided by one component to
      that required by another

    * Specify how to adapt objects of a particular type or class (even
      built-in types) to a particular required interface

    * Automatically adapt a supplied object to a required interface,
      and

    * Do all of the above, even when the components or frameworks
      involved were not written to take advantage of this package, and
      even if the frameworks have different mechanisms for defining
      interfaces.
