Webby is a fantastic little website management system.
It would be called a content management system if it
were a bigger kid. But, it's just a runt with a
special knack for transforming text.

Webby works by combining the contents of a page with
a layout to produce HTML. The layout contains
everything common to all the pages HTML headers,
navigation menu, footer, etc. and the page
contains just the information for that page. You
can use your favorite markup language to write
your pages; Webby supports quite a few.
