WebSocket++ is an open source (BSD license) header only C++ library that
implements RFC6455 The WebSocket Protocol.

It allows integrating WebSocket client and server functionality into
C++ programs. It uses interchangable network transport modules including
one based on C++ iostreams and one based on Boost Asio.
