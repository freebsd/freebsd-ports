This package provides the ShortText type which is suitable for keeping many
short strings in memory. This is similiar to how ShortByteString relates to
 ByteString.

The main difference between Text and ShortText is that ShortText uses UTF-8
instead of UTF-16 internally and also doesn't support slicing (thereby
saving 2 words). Consequently, the memory footprint of a (boxed) ShortText
value is 4 words (2 words when unboxed) plus the length of the UTF-8 encoded
payload.
