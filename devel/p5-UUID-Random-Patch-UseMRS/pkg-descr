UUID::Random::Patch::UseMRS makes UUID::Random use rand() from
Math::Random::Secure instead of the default rand() that comes with Perl. It is
useful for creating cryptographically secure UUID's. On the other hand, as a
note, this makes generate() around 20 times slower.

After you use this module, use UUID::Random as usual.
