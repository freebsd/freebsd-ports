GeanyCtags adds a simple support for generating and querying ctags
files for a Geany project.

Even though Geany supports symbol definition searching by itself
within the open files (and with a plugin support within the whole
project), tag regeneration can become too slow for really big
projects.  This is why this plugin was created.  It makes it possible
to generate the tag file only once and just query it when searching
for a particular symbol definition/declaration.
