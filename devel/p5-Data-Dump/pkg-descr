This module provides a single function called dump() that takes a list of
values as its argument and produces a string as its result. The string contains
Perl code that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original arguments.
The string is formatted for easy reading.

If dump() is called in a void context, then the dump is printed on STDERR
instead of being returned.

If you don't like importing a function that overrides Perl's not-so-useful
builtin, then you can also import the same function as pp(), mnemonic for
"pretty-print".
