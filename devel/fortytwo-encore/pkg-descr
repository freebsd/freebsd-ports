Encore is a set of utility classes written in Objective-C for GNUstep and
Mac OS X.  The motivation of writing these classes was driven by
implementing the projects BDB and FT. The classes may be useful for other
projects as well.

The classes include
  - logging:  A flexible logging mechanism similar to log4j. Supports
    logging levels, logging contexts, different output channels per context,
    configuration per xml, ...

  - XML-based reflection: a configuration mechanism which is based on XML and
    uses inversion of control (see tests for an example)

  - a simple testing framework

  - StringUtils class

  - an iterator interface
