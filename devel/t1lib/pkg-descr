t1lib is a library written in the C programming language allowing a programmer
to generate bitmaps from Adobe (TM) Type 1 fonts quite easily. These bitmaps
are returned in a data structure with type GLYPH. This special GLYPH-type is
also used in the X11 window system to describe character bitmaps. It contains
the bitmap data as well as some metric information. But t1lib is in itself
entirely independent of the X11-system or any other graphical user interface.
