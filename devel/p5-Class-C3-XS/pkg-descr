This contains XS performance enhancers for Class::C3 version
0.16 and higher.  The main Class::C3 package will use this
package automatically if it can find it.  Do not use this
package directly, use Class::C3 instead.

This module won't do anything for you if you're running a
version of Class::C3 older than 0.16.  (It's not a
dependency because it would be circular with the optional
dep from that package to this one).
