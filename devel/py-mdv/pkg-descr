When you edit multiple md files remotely, like in a larger mkdocs project,
context switches between editing terminal(s) and viewing browser may have some
efficiency impact. Also sometimes there is just no browser, like via security
gateways offering just a fixed set of applications on the hop in machine.
Further, reading efficiency and convenience is often significantly improved by
using colors. And lastly, using such a thing for cli applications might improve
user output, e.g. for help texts.

This is where mdv, a Python based Markdown viewer for the terminal might be a
good option.
