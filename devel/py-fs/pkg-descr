Pyfilesystem is a Python module that provides a simplified common interface to
many types of filesystem. Filesystems exposed via Pyfilesystem can also be
served over the network, or 'mounted' on the native filesystem.

Pyfilesystem simplifies working directories and paths, even if you only intend
to work with local files. Differences in path formats between platforms are
abstracted away, and you can write code that sand-boxes any changes to a given
directory.
