Ksql is a "lazy man's" wrapper for the SQLite C API.  It is written to
make sure sloppy programming won't cause your SQLite database to be
inconsistent (transactions and statements open on exit and certain
signals).  Specifically, it exits on any database errors; and upon
exit (or signal), cleans up open statements, transactions, and
databases.
