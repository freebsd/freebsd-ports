mtdev is a stand-alone library which transforms all variants of kernel
MT events to the slotted type B protocol. The events put into mtdev
may be from any MT device, specifically type A without contact
tracking, type A with contact tracking, or type B with contact
tracking. See Linux kernel documentation for further details.
