Small Ruby library that colors strings using ANSI escape sequences.
It's possible to use constants:

    print red, bold, "red bold", reset, "\n"

or unary functions:

    print red(bold("red bold")), "\n"

Blockforms do also autoreset at the block's end:

    print red { bold { "red bold" } }, "\n"

It's also possible to use this module as Mixin for classes of objects that
respond to :to_str, e.g. String.

    class String
      include Term::ANSIColor
    end
    print "red bold".red.bold, "\n"
