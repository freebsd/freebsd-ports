Pystorm lets you run Python code against real-time streams of data via
Apache Storm. With pystorm you can create Storm bolts and spouts in
Python without having to write a single line of Java. It is meant to be
used under-the-hood by Storm Python libraries that will provide the
command-line tools for actually building/submitting the topologies
(e.g., streamparse and pyleus).
