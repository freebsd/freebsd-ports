This is a ruby client for statsd. It provides a lightweight way to track and
measure metrics in your application.

It calls out to statsd by sending data over a UDP socket.  UDP sockets are fast,
but unreliable.  There is no guarantee that your data will ever arrive at its
location.  In other words, fire and forget. This is perfect for this use case
because it means your code does not get bogged down trying to log statistics.
