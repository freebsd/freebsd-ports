The functions in this module implement or assist the writing of
programs, or parts of them, in Continuation Passing Style (CPS).
Briefly, CPS is a style of writing code where the normal call/return
mechanism is replaced by explicit "continuations", values passed in
to functions which they should invoke, to implement return behaviour.
