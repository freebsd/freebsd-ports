Workflow - Simple, flexible perl-based system to implement workflows.
This is a standalone workflow system. It is designed to fit into your system
rather than force your system to fit to it. You can save workflow information
to a database or the filesystem (or a custom storage). The different components
of a workflow system can be included separately as libraries to allow for
maximum reusibility.
