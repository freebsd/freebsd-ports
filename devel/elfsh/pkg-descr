The ELF shell 0.5 takes advantage of a hash based, lazy typed
object oriented architecture, a readline based interactive mode
(35+ builtin commands, with history, completion, regular
expression powered), a scripting mode (sample scripts and
session logs available on this page) and brings more
modification API (relocation tables, .interp, .dynamic,
.dynsym, PAX bits, and +), atomic operations with get/set and
add/sub/mul/div/mod commands, section injection by top (insert
unlimited amount of data in the executable PT_LOAD, even in
non-executable environments), a quiet output for tiny screens,
ELFsh modules support, sophisticated write/printf primitives,
SPARC PLT infection, experimental ET_EXEC relocation and
remapping features, ET_REL injection into ET_EXEC (with bss and
symtab merging support), disassembly (with good resolving) on
i386 binaries with libasm, and much more.
