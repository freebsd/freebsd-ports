The ELF shell 0.5 takes advantage of a hash based, lazy typed 
object oriented architecture, a readline based interactive mode 
(35+ builtin commands, with history, completion, regular 
expression powered), a scripting mode (sample scripts and 
session logs available on this page) and brings more 
modification API (relocation tables, .interp, .dynamic, 
.dynsym, PAX bits, and +), atomic operations with get/set and 
add/sub/mul/div/mod commands, section injection by top (insert 
unlimited amount of data in the executable PT_LOAD, even in 
non-executable environments), a quiet output for tiny screens, 
ELFsh modules support, sophisticated write/printf primitives, 
SPARC PLT infection, experimental ET_EXEC relocation and 
remapping features, ET_REL injection into ET_EXEC (with bss and 
symtab merging support), disassembly (with good resolving) on 
i386 binaries with libasm, and much more.
