This ASDF initialization enables working with Common Lisp (CL) installed via
FreeBSD Ports by serving three key functions:

1. It configures a central registry to tell ASDF where to find systems
   installed via FreeBSD CL ports.

2. It sets up output translations so no code from CL ports needs to be
   compiled at load time.

   CL ports have binary variants for each supported CL implementation.  For
   example, devel/cl-alexandria includes the Alexandria sources, and
   devel/cl-alexandria-sbcl installs the compiled code (fasl) for SBCL.  The
   output translations tell ASDF where to look for the binary code.

3. It configures specific ASDF output translations for building CL ports.
