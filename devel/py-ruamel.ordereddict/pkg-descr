This is an implementation of an ordered dictionary with Key Insertion
Order (KIO: updates of values do not affect the position of the key),
Key Value Insertion Order (KVIO, an existing keyâ€™s position is removed
and put at the back). The standard library module OrderedDict,
implemented later, implements a subset of ordereddict functionality.
