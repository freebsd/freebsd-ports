IO::All - Spiffy Perl Interface Framework For You

Spiffy" is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented programming
in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm, base.pm, mixin.pm and
SUPER.pm into one magic foundation class. It attempts to fix all the nits and
warts of traditional Perl OO, in a clean, straightforward and
(perhaps someday) standard way.
