Luabind is a library that helps you create bindings between C++ and
Lua. It has the ability to expose functions and classes, written
in C++, to Lua. It will also supply the functionality to define
classes in lua and let them derive from other lua classes or C++
classes. Lua classes can override virtual functions from their C++
baseclasses. It is written towards Lua 5.x, and does not work with
Lua 4.

It is implemented utilizing template meta programming. That means
that you don't need an extra preprocess pass to compile your project
(it is done by the compiler). It also means you don't (usually)
have to know the exact signature of each function you register,
since the library will generate code depending on the compile-time
type of the function (which includes the signature). The main
drawback of this approach is that the compilation time will increase
for the file that does the registration, it is therefore recommended
that you register everything in the same cpp-file.
