Extract the names of the modules used in a file using a static analysis.
Since this module does not run code, it cannot find dynamic uses of
modules, such as eval "require $class". It only reports modules that the
file loads directly. Modules loaded with parent or base, for instance,
will will be in the import list for those pragmas but won't have separate
entries in the data this module returns.
