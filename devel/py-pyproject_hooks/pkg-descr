pyproject-hooks is a low-level library for calling build-backends in
pyproject.toml-based project. It provides the basic functionality to help write
tooling that generates distribution files from Python projects.

If you want a tool that builds Python packages, you'll want to use
devel/py-build instead. This is an underlying piece for pip, build and other
"build frontends" use to call "build backends" within them.
