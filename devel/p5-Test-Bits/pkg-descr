Test::Bits provides a single subroutine, bits_is(), for testing binary data.

This module is quite similar to Test::BinaryData and Test::HexString in concept.
The difference is that this module shows failure diagnostics in a different way,
and has a slightly different calling style. Depending on the nature of the data
you're working with, this module may be easier to work with.
