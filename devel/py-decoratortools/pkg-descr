Want to use decorators, but still need to support Python 2.3?
Wish you could have class decorators, decorate arbitrary assignments,
or match decorated function signatures to their original functions?
Want to get metaclass features without creating metaclasses?
How about synchronized methods?

"DecoratorTools" gets you all of this and more.
