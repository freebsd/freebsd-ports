Ransack is a rewrite of MetaSearch created by Ernie Miller and maintained by
Ryan Bigg, Jon Atack and a great group of contributors. While it supports many
of the same features as MetaSearch, its underlying implementation differs
greatly from MetaSearch, and backwards compatibility is not a design goal.

Ransack enables the creation of both simple and advanced search forms for your
Ruby on Rails application (demo source code here). If you're looking for
something that simplifies query generation at the model or controller layer,
you're probably not looking for Ransack (or MetaSearch, for that matter). Try
Squeel instead.
