The zope.minmax.AbstractValue class provides a super class which can be
subclassed to store arbitrary homogeneous values in a persistent storage
and apply different conflict resolution policies.

The subclasses defined here are resolving the conflicts using always
either the maximum or the minimum of the conflicting values.
