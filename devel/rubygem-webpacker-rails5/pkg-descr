Webpacker makes it easy to use the JavaScript preprocessor and bundler Webpack
to manage application-like JavaScript in Rails. It coexists with the asset
pipeline, as the primary purpose for Webpack is app-like JavaScript, not images,
css, or even JavaScript Sprinkles (that all continues to live in app/assets). It
is, however, possible to use Webpacker for CSS and images assets as well, in
which case you may not even need the asset pipeline. This is mostly relevant
when exclusively using component-based JavaScript frameworks.
