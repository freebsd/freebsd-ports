Vimode is a Vim-mode plugin for Geany written by a guy who does not
use Vim.

Despite the limited Vim knowledge of the author, the plugin tries
to be a reasonably complete Vim mode implementation featuring:

 - normal mode, insert/replace mode, visual mode, line visual mode
 - repeated commands (e.g. 10dd - delete 10 lines)
 - "motion" commands (e.g. d10l - delete 10 characters to the right)
 - "text object" commands (e.g. di( - delete inner contents of parentheses)
 - visual mode commands (e.g. ~ to swap case of the selected text)
 - basic ex mode commands like :s, including range specifications
 - most basic navigation, selection and text manipulation commands
 - command repetition using "." and repeated insert
