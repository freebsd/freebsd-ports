libLASi is a library written by Larry Siden  that provides a C++ stream
output interface ( with operator << ) for creating Postscript documents
that can contain characters from any of the scripts and symbol blocks
supported in Unicode  and by Owen Taylor's Pango layout engine. The
library accommodates right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew as
easily as left-to-right scripts. Indic and Indic-derived Complex Text
Layout (CTL) scripts, such as Devanagari, Thai, Lao, and Tibetan are
supported to the extent provided by Pango and by the OpenType fonts
installed on your system. All of this is provided without need for any
special configuration or layout calculation on the programmer's part.
