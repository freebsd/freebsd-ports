This module adds cancellation capabilities for threads. Cancelled threads are
terminated using threads->exit(). The thread is then detached, and hence
automatically cleaned up.

Threads that are suspended using Thread::Suspend do not need to be resumed in
order to be cancelled.

It is possible for a thread to cancel itself.
