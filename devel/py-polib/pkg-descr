PoLib is a python library to parse and manage gettext catalogs.

polib allows you to manipulate, create, modify gettext files
(pot, po and mo files). You can load existing files, iterate
through it's entries, add, modify entries, comments or metadata, etc...
or create new po files from scratch.

polib provides a simple and pythonic API, exporting only three
convenience functions 'pofile', 'mofile' and 'detect_encoding',
and the 4 core classes: POFile, MOFile, POEntry and MOEntry for
creating new files/entries.
