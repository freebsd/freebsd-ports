Hashie is available as a RubyGem which extend Hashes and make them more useful.

    * Hashie::Mash: gives simple pseudo-object functionality that can be
      built from hashes and easily extended
    * Hashie::Dash: has a discrete set of defined properties and only those
      properties may be set on the hash.
    * Hashie::Trash: a Dash that allows you to translate keys on
      initialization.
    * Hashie::Clash: allows you to easily construct complex hashes using
      method notation chaining.
