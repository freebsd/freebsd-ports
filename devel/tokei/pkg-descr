Tokei is a program that displays statistics about your code.  Tokei
will show number of files, total lines within those files and code,
comments, and blanks grouped by language. 

It is fast, supports over 100 languages, and correctly handles multi
line comments, nested comments, while ignoring comments that are in
strings, providing accurate code statistics.
