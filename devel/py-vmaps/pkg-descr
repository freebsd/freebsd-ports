This module provides Vmap objects, which are extremely fast on-disk arrays
with facilities for shared access by multiple processes, independant of
Python or operating system threads or SysV IPC limits. The included example
program shows trivial examples of using Vmaps for interprocess communication
and multiple simultaneous writers of a shared data set.
