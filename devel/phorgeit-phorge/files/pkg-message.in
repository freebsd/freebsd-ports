Make sure to run phorge using a production PHP configuration,
e.g., %%PREFIX/etc/php.ini-production, particularly
using the recommended error_reporting setting for production:

  error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT

To run the phorge daemons from startup, add phd_enable="YES"
to /etc/rc.conf. You can control the daemons using

service phd start
service phd stop
etc.

Before starting the daemons, please finish configuring your Phorge
instance. This involves configuring a web server (Apache, NGINX, LightHTTP)
and a database server (MySQL, MariaDB). You can find detailed instructions
on how to finish your setup at:

https://secure.phorge.com/book/phorge/article/configuration_guide/

Please note that all files are located in %%PREFIX%%/lib/php/phorge,
so if the documentation refers to ./bin, this means

  %%PREFIX%%/lib/php/phorge/bin,

if it refers to webroot, this means

  %%PREFIX%%/lib/php/phorge/webroot.

You might want to install textproc/py-pygments to improve syntax
highlighting.

Phorge daemons and ssh-git requires setting up sudo, see

  %%PREFIX%%lib/php/phorge/resources/sshd/phorge-sudoers.sample

for an example.

A phorge example configuration installed here:

  %%PREFIX%%lib/php/phorge/conf/local/local.json.sample

If you want to access phorge hosted git repositories via git,
you can add the following configuration snippet to /etc/sshd_config
and reload sshd afterwards (`service sshd reload'):

Don't forget to update the database schema after update:

  service nginx stop
  service php-fpm stop
  service phd stop
  cd %%PREFIX%%/lib/php/phorge
  ./bin/storage upgrade
  service phd start
  service php-fpm start
  service nginx start

The above procedure is for users of nginx and php-fpm, please adapt
accordingly to match your setup.

If your configuration uses an unprivileged user to connect to the database,
you may have to override the default user so the schema changes can be
applied with root or some other admin user:

  ./bin/storage upgrade --user <user> --password <password>
