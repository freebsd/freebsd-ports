An abstract interface to highly-parameterizable queues/deques. Background:
There exists a feature space for queues that extends between:

 * simple, single-ended, non-concurrent, bounded queues
 * double-ended, threadsafe, growable queues

... with important points inbetween (such as the queues used for
work-stealing). This package includes an interface for Deques that
allows the programmer to use a single API for all of the above, while
using the type-system to select an efficient implementation given the
requirements (using type families). This package also includes a simple
reference implementation based on 'IORef' and "Data.Sequence".
