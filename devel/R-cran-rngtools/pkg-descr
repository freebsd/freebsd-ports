This package contains a set of functions for working with Random
Number Generators (RNGs). In particular, it defines a generic S4
framework for getting/setting the current RNG, or RNG data that are
embedded into objects for reproducibility. Notably, convenient
default methods greatly facilitate the way current RNG settings can
be changed.
