Hishel is a library that implements HTTP Caching for HTTPX and HTTP Core
libraries in accordance with RFC 9111, the most recent caching specification.

Features:
- Persistence: Responses are cached in the persistent memory for later use.
- Compatibility: It is completely compatible with your existing transports or
  connection pools, whether they are default, custom, or provided by third-party
  libraries.
- Easy to use: You continue to use httpx while also enabling web cache.
- Smart: Attempts to clearly implement RFC 9111, understands Vary, Etag,
  Last-Modified, Cache-Control, and Expires headers, and handles response
  re-validation automatically.
- Configurable: You have complete control over how the responses are stored and
  serialized.
- From the package:
  - Built-in support for File system, Redis, SQLite, and AWS S3 backends.
  - Built-in support for JSON, YAML, and pickle serializers.
- Very fast: Your requests will be even faster if there are no IO operations.
