Fruit is a dependency injection framework for C++, loosely inspired by the Guice
framework for Java. It uses C++ metaprogramming together with some C++11
features to detect most injection problems at compile-time. It allows to split
the implementation code in "components" (aka modules) that can be assembled to
form other components. From a component with no requirements it's then possible
to create an injector, that provides an instance of the interfaces exposed by
the component.
