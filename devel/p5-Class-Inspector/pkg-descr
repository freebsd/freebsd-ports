Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class.
Most or all of this information can be found in other ways, but they
arn't always very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level
of Perl wizardry, or strange or unusual looking code.  Class::Inspector
attempts to provide an easier, more friendly interface to this
information.
