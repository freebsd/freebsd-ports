The reaper module provides a $SIG{CHLD} handler that can be installed
globally as well as locally. It also supports chaining of signal handlers,
meaning it will not just replace an existing $SIG{CHLD} handler.  It still
requires applications to do the right thing in using this module and not
installing their own versions. At least it provides a consistent
implementation that can be shared between various modules.
