CMUNGE is a simple tool for encrypting and compacting C source code, while
leaving it syntactically and semantically unchanged. It does this by:

* Recursively in-lining `user-defined' #include files.
* Renaming C identifiers, except those in the C Standard Library, with names
  like l1 (i.e. letter-l one), l2, l3, etc.
* Removing comments and blank lines, converting multiple consecutive whitespace
  characters (including `\n') into single blanks, removing all unnecessary
  whitespace between tokens.
* Outputting the transformed code in lines of least N characters long, where N
  is a user-specified minimum line length.

It accepts ANSI and K & R C as its input language.
