Best program ever.

This program is a wrapper, it will exec whatever arguments it's given and
if the program returns a non-zero exit status or terminates abnormally it
will prompt the user to run the program again.

It's best used when debugging a large build like so:

make CC="replay cc"

Then if cc bombs you don't have to restart make, you can just fix your
source file and resume your build.
