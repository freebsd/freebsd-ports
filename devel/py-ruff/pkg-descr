Features:
* 10-100x faster than existing linters
* Installable via pip
* Python 3.11 compatibility
* pyproject.toml support
* Built-in caching, to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
* Autofix support, for automatic error correction (e.g., automatically
  remove unused imports)
* Near-parity with the built-in Flake8 rule set
* Native re-implementations of popular Flake8 plugins, like flake8-bugbear
* Monorepo-friendly configuration via hierarchical and cascading settings
