Fifechan is a lightweight cross platform GUI library written in C++
specifically designed for games.  It has a small yet powerful built-in
set of extendable GUI Widgets allowing users to create virtually
unlimited types of widgets.

Fifechan supports rendering in SDL, OpenGL, or Allegro out of the box
or it can be adapted to use any rendering engine the user requires.
Events are pushed to Fifechan which allows users to use any input
library they wish or they could use the built in input handling
through either SDL input or Allegro input.

The primary goal for Fifechan is to keep it extendable, lightweight
and still be powerful enough to use in all types of games out of the
box.
