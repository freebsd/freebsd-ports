This package provides a high level, convenient API for managing 
internationalization translation contexts in Python application. There is a 
simple API for single-context applications, such as command line scripts which 
only need to translate into one language during the entire course of their 
execution. There is a more flexible, but still convenient API for multi-context
applications, such as servers, which may need to switch language contexts for 
different tasks.
