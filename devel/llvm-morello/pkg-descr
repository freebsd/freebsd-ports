The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
toolchain technologies.  This version adds support for the Arm Morello
prototype architecture (CHERI ported to ARMv8-A).

This port includes Clang (a C/C++/Objective-C compiler), LLD (a linker),
and the LLVM infrastructure these are built on.
