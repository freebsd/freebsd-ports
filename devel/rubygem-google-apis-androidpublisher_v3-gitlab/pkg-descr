This is the simple REST client for Google Play Android Developer API V3.
Simple REST clients are Ruby client libraries that provide access to Google
services via their HTTP REST API endpoints. These libraries are generated
and updated automatically based on the discovery documents published by the
service, and they handle most concerns such as authentication, pagination,
retry, timeouts, and logging. You can use this client to access the Google
Play Android Developer API, but note that some services may provide a
separate modern client that is easier to use.
