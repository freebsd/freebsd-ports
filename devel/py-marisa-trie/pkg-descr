MARISA Trie provides static memory-efficient Trie-like structures for Python
based on marisa-trie C++ library.

String data in a MARISA-trie may take up to 50x-100x less memory than in a
standard Python dict; the raw lookup speed is comparable; trie also provides
fast advanced methods like prefix search.

Note: There are official SWIG-based Python bindings included in C++ library
distribution; this package provides alternative Cython-based pip-installable
Python bindings.
