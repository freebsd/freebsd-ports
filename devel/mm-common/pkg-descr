This module is part of the GNOME C++ bindings effort <http://www.gtkmm.org/>.

The mm-common module provides the build infrastructure and utilities
shared among the GNOME C++ binding libraries.  It is only a required
dependency for building the C++ bindings from the gnome.org version
control repository.  An installation of mm-common is not required for
building tarball releases, unless configured to use maintainer-mode.

Release archives of mm-common include the Doxygen tag file for the
GNU C++ Library reference documentation.  It is covered by the same
licence as the source code it was extracted from.  More information
is available at <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/>.
