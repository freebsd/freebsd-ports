pymaven is a library for working with maven repositories via python. pymaven is
not intended as a complete replacement of the maven build system, but instead as
a way for python programs to fetch artifacts and artifact dependencies from
maven2 repositories. 

Note: This is a forked version from the 2.x branch that supports unicode and
      uses other routines for data structures.
