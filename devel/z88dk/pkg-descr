Z88DK is a collection of software development tools that targets the 8080
and Z80 family of machines.  It allows development of programs in C,
assembly language, or any mixture of the two.  What makes Z88DK unique is
its ease of use, built-in support for many Z80 machines and its extensive
set of assembly language library subroutines implementing the C standard
and extensions.
