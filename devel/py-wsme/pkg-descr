Web Services Made Easy (WSME) simplifies the writing of REST web services by
providing simple yet powerful typing, removing the need to directly manipulate
the request and the response objects.  WSME can work standalone or on top of
your favorite Python web (micro)framework, so you can use both your preferred
way of routing your REST requests and most of the features of WSME that rely
on the typing system.
