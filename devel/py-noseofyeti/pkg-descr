noseOfYeti creates a custom Python codec that lets you write your tests
using an RSpec inspired DSL (i.e. `describe` and `it` blocks). It uses the
fact that you can register a codec that is able to modify a Python file
before executing it.  Using this we can make it so that when Python imports
a file with a particular encoding as the first line of the file it will be
intercepted and potentially rewritten into something else before the import
continues.

noseOfYeti uses this technique to translate from the DSL it defines, into
Python classes and functions that then will be executed by your test
framework of choice.
