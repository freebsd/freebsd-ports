Syntax::Keyword::Dynamically provides a syntax plugin that implements a single
keyword, dynamically, which alters the behaviour of a scalar assignment
operation. Syntactically and semantically it is similar to the built-in perl
keyword local, but is implemented somewhat differently to give two key
advantages over regular local:
- You can dynamically assign to lvalue functions and accessors.
- You can dynamically assign to regular lexical variables.
