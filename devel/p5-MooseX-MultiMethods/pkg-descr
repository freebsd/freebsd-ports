MooseX::MultiMethods provides multi method dispatch based on Moose type
constraints. It does so by providing a multi keyword that extends the
method keyword provided by MooseX::Method::Signatures.

When invoking a method declared as multi a matching variant is being searched
in all the declared multi variants based on the passed parameters and the
declared type constraints. If a variant has been found, it will be invoked.
If no variant could be found, an exception will be thrown.
