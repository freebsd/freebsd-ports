Wizer instantiates your WebAssembly module, executes its initialization
function, and then snapshots the initialized state out into a new WebAssembly
module. Now you can use this new, pre-initialized WebAssembly module to hit the
ground running, without making your users wait for that first-time set up code
to complete.
