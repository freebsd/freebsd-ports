Fixtures defines a Python contract for reusable state / support logic, primarily
for unit testing. Helper and adaption logic is included to make it easy to write
your own fixtures using the fixtures contract. Glue code is provided that makes
using fixtures that meet the Fixtures contract in unittest compatible test cases
easy and straight forward.
