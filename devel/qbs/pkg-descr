Qbs is a tool that helps simplify the build process for developing projects
across multiple platforms. Qbs can be used for any software project,
regardless of programming language, toolkit, or libraries used.

Qbs is an all-in-one tool that generates a build graph from a high-level
project description (like qmake or CMake) and additionally undertakes
the task of executing the commands in the low-level build graph (like make).
