PHP Client for the Selenium Remote Control test tool

Selenium Remote Control (SRC) is a test tool that allows you to write
automated web application UI tests in any programming language against
any HTTP website using any mainstream JavaScript-enabled browser. SRC
provides a Selenium Server, which can automatically start/stop/control
any supported browser. It works by using Selenium Core, a pure-HTML+JS
library that performs automated tasks in JavaScript; the Selenium
Server communicates directly with the browser using AJAX
(XmlHttpRequest).
