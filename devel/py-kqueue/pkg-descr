py-kqueue (aka PyKQueue) is a Python module that interfaces to the kqueue(2)
and kevent(2) system calls.  kqueue(2) and kevent(2) implements an
event-driven notification system, intended as a replacement for select(2) and
poll(2), which require lengthy preparation and bookkeeping to use.  With
kevent(2), a list of file descriptors or other object to monitor is passed
in once, and the system returns a notification when the object triggers a
filter, such as 'ready to read data' for file descriptors.  See the
man pages for details.

This Python module provides a C module and supporting Python script to
use these functions in a object-oriented manner.
