Taint is a good thing. However, few people use taint even though they should.
The goal of this module isn't to use taint less, but to actually encourage its
use more.

This module aims to make using taint as painless as possible (This can be an
argument against it - often implementation of security implies pain - so taking
away pain might lessen security - sort of).
