File::HomeDir::PathClass is just a wrapper around File::HomeDir methods,
transforming their return value to Path::Class objects. This allows for easier
usage of the value.

Refer to File::HomeDir#METHODS for a list of which functions are supported.
File::HomeDir::PathClass supports both original File::HomeDir interfaces.
