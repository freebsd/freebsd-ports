KAssert is the assertion library used by KaMPIng, the Karlsruhe MPI
Wrapper. However, KAssert does not depend on MPI and can be used in
non-MPI code.

Features:

 - Assertion levels to distinguish between computationally cheap and
   expensive assertions
 - Expression decomposition to give more insights into failed
   assertions
 - Throwing assertions
