xwpe is a X-window programming environment designed for UNIX systems.
It is similar to 'Borland C++' MS-DOS programming IDE environment.

xwpe supports many compilers, linkers, and debuggers, so you are not tied to
any particular set of tools.  There is both a curses and X11 interface
(the later with mouse support).

Errors that occur while compiling and linking a program can be examined in
the sources -- the cursor will jump to the corresponding line in the
source file.   Programs composed of more than one source file, can be
managed with the project-option.  Your program may be run and debugged from
within xwpe -- allowing the user to set breakpoints and watch variables.

Note:  there are both English and German language version of the man pages,
and help files.  The German language version will be installed if
"GERMAN_LANG" is set during ``make install'' of the port.
