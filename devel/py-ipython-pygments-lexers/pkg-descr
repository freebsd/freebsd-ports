A Pygments plugin for IPython code & console sessions

IPython is an interactive Python shell. Among other features, it adds some
special convenience syntax, including %magics, !shell commands and help?. This
package contains lexers for these, to use with the Pygments syntax highlighting
package.
- The ipython lexer should be used where only input code is highlighted
- The ipythonconsole lexer works for an IPython session, including code,
  prompts, output and tracebacks.

These lexers were previously part of IPython itself (in IPython.lib.lexers), but
have now been moved to a separate package.
