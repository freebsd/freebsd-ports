This package provides some low-level utilities to use for package
development. It currently provides managers for multiple package
specific options and registries, vignette, unit test and bibtex
related utilities. It serves as a base package for packages like
NMF, RcppOctave, doRNG, and as an incubator package for other general
purposes utilities, that will eventually be packaged separately.
It is still under heavy development and changes in the interface(s)
are more than likely to happen.
