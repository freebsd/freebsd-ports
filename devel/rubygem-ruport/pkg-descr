Ruby Reports (Ruport) is an extensible reporting system.

It aims to be as lightweight as possible while still providing core support
for data aggregation and manipulation as well as multi-format rendering
of reports.

Ruport provides tools for using a number of data sources, including CSV files,
ActiveRecord models, and raw SQL connections via RubyDBI (through ruport-util).
