CVSTrac is a bug and patch-set tracking system for use with CVS
appropriate for use on projects with up to a few hundred developers.
CVSTrac is designed for low-ceremony development - it provides
mechanisms for tracking changes and bugs without unnecessary
restrictions. It has a built-in Wiki and ticketing system. Both
of these functions can be linked to the CVS tree.
