distcc is a program to distribute compilation of C code across
several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the
same results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and
is often significantly faster than a local compile.

Unlike other distributed build systems, distcc does not require all
machines to share a filesystem, have synchronized clocks, or to
have the same libraries or header files installed. Machines can be
running different operating systems, as long as they have compatible
binary formats or cross-compilers.

distcc sends the complete preprocessed source code across the network
for each job, so all it requires of the volunteer machines is that
they be running the distccd daemon, and that they have an appropriate
compiler installed.
