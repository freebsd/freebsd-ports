Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration
files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML. And
unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
parsing in application code.

Libconfig is very compact - a fraction of the size of the expat XML
parser library. This makes it well-suited for memory-constrained systems
like handheld devices.

The library includes bindings for both the C and C++ languages. It works
on POSIX-compliant UNIX and UNIX-like systems (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X,
Solaris, FreeBSD), Android, and Windows (2000, XP and later).
