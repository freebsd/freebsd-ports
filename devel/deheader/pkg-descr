Deheader analyzes C and C++ files to determine which header inclusions 
can be removed while still allowing them to compile. This may result in 
substantial improvements in compilation time, especially on large C++ 
projects; it also sometimes exposes dependencies and cohesions of which 
developers were unaware.
