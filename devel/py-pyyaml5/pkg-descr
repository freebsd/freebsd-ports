PyYAML is a YAML parser and emitter for the Python programming language.

PyYAML features:
   * a complete YAML 1.1 parser. In particular, PyYAML can parse all examples
     from the specification. The parsing algorithm is simple enough to be a
     reference for YAML parser implementors.
   * Unicode support including UTF-8/UTF-16 input/output and \u escape
     sequences.
   * low-level event-based parser and emitter API (like SAX).
   * high-level API for serializing and deserializing native Python objects
     (like DOM or pickle).
   * support for all types from the YAML types repository. A simple extension
     API is provided.
   * relatively sensible error messages.
