POE::Component::Client::HTTP is an asynchronous, event driven HTTP user
agent.  It accepts events containing HTTP::Request objects, and it
returns events carrying HTTP::Response objects.  It supports https and
simultaneous HTTP transactions.  It lets other sessions run while HTTP
transactions are being processed, and it lets several HTTP transactions
be processed in parallel.
