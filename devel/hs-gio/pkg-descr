GIO is striving to provide a modern, easy-to-use VFS API that sits at the
right level in the library stack. The goal is to overcome the shortcomings
of GnomeVFS and provide an API that is so good that developers prefer it
over raw POSIX calls. Among other things that means using GObject. It also
means not cloning the POSIX API, but providing higher-level, document-centric
interfaces.
