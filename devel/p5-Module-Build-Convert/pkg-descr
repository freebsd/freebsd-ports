Module::Build::Convert - Makefile.PL to Build.PL converter

ExtUtils::MakeMaker has been a de-facto standard for the common
distribution of Perl modules; Module::Build is expected to supersede
ExtUtils::MakeMaker in some time (part of the Perl core as of 5.10?)

The transition takes place slowly, as the converting process manually
achieved is yet an uncommon practice. The Module::Build::Convert
Makefile.PL parser is intended to ease the transition process.
