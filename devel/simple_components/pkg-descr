This is a library created by Dmitry Kazakov out of necessity, which was
released under the GMGPL and provides Ada implementations of:

   - smart pointers               - B-trees
   - directed graphs              - stacks
   - sets                         - tables
   - maps                         - string editing
   - unbounded arrays             - expression analyzers
   - lock-free data structures
   - synchronization primitives (events, race condition free pulse events,
       arrays of events, reentrant mutexes, deadlock-free arrays of mutexes)
   - pseudo-random non-repeating numbers
   - symmetric encoding and decoding
   - IEEE 754 representations support
   - multiple connections server/client designing tools.

Tables management and strings editing are described in separate documents;
see Tables and Strings edit.  The library is kept conform to the Ada 95,
Ada 2005, Ada 2012 language standards.
