This module implements the A* pathfinding algorithm. It acts as a base class
from which a custom map object can be derived. It requires from the map object
a subroutine named "getSurrounding" and provides to the object a routine called
"findPath" which calculates the shortest (ie. least-expensive) path between two
nodes.
