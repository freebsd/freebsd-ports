Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance
testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has
easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and utilizes the keyword-driven
testing approach. Its testing capabilities can be extended by test
libraries implemented either with Python or Java, and users can create
new keywords from existing ones using the same syntax that is used for
creating test cases.
