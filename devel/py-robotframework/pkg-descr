Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing
and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use tabular test
data syntax and utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach. Its testing
capabilities can be extended by test libraries implemented either with Python
or Java, and users can create new keywords from existing ones using the same
syntax that is used for creating test cases.
