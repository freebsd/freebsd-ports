Uniq is a Perl module designed for simple and effective list management,
specifically targeting the elimination of duplicate values. It includes
functions like uniq, which filters out duplicate entries from a list,
dups for identifying any repeated values, and distinct to guarantee a
list of only unique elements. This module is particularly useful for
tasks that involve data cleaning or when you need to ensure the
uniqueness of list items in your Perl scripts. Easy to integrate and
use, Uniq helps maintain clean and efficient lists in any Perl project,
making it a practical tool for developers and anyone working with data.
