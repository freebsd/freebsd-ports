meta provides an API for metaprogramming; that is, allowing code to inspect or
manipulate parts of its own program structure. Parts of the perl interpreter
itself can be accessed by means of "meta"-objects provided by this package.
Methods on these objects allow inspection of details, as well as creating new
items or removing existing ones.

The intention of this API is to provide a nicer replacement for existing tricks
such as no strict 'refs' and using globrefs, and also to be a more consistent
place to add new abilities, such as more APIs for inspection and alteration of
internal structures, metaprogramming around the new 'class' feature, and other
such uses.
