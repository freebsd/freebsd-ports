PyInstaller is a program that converts (packages) Python programs into stand-
alone executables, under Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix-like operating systems.

Its main advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works with any
version of Python since 2.4, it builds smaller executables thanks to
transparent compression, it is fully multi-platform, and uses the OS support
to load the dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full compatibility.

The main goal of PyInstaller is to be compatible with third-party packages
out-of-the-box.  This means that, with PyInstaller, all the required tricks
to make external packages work are already integrated within PyInstaller
itself so that there is no user intervention required.
