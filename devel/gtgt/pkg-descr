The (general | GNU) template generation tools are a set of scripts
for creating a whole set of sources, which may already be compiled
and installed by using the GNU development tools. Think of gtgt as
a program which is able to create an already compilable, very
sophisticated "hello world" program, written in C or C++ and
constituted by a main program, two internal modules (classes), one
static and one shared library. Using gitty-gitty you will get a
template of sources for the main cases you might meet, and which
you can also use as examples for automake, autoconf and so on.
