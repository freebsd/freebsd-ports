The phptags utility makes a tags file from the specified PHP sources.
A tags file gives the locations of specified objects in a group of files.
Each line of the tags file contains the object name, the file in which it is
defined, and a search pattern for the object definition, separated by
white-space. Using the tags file, many editors (ex(1), vim(1), emacs(1), etc)
can quickly locate these object definitions.
