Run Rust script files without any setup or explicit compilation step,
with seamless use of crates specified as dependencies inside the
scripts.

With rust-script Rust files and expressions can be executed just like
a shell or Python script. Features include:

- Caching compiled artifacts for speed.
- Reading Cargo manifests embedded in Rust scripts.
- Supporting executable Rust scripts via Unix shebangs and Windows
  file associations.
- Using expressions as stream filters (i.e. for use in command pipelines).
- Running unit tests and benchmarks from scripts.

You can get an overview of the available options using the --help flag.
