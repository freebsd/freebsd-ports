SIP is a tool for generating bindings for C++ classes so that they can be
accessed as normal Python classes.  SIP takes many of its ideas from SWIG but,
because it is specifically designed for C++ and Python, is able to generate
tighter bindings.  SIP is so called because it is a small SWIG.

SIP was originally designed to generate Python bindings for KDE and so has
explicit support for the signal slot mechanism used by the Qt/KDE class
libraries.  However, SIP can be used to generate Python bindings for any C++
class library.

The bindings generated by SIP support access to the following C++ and Qt
features:
	- connecting Qt signals to Python functions and class methods
	- connecting Python signals to Qt slots
	- overloading virtual member functions with Python class methods
	- protected member functions
	- abstract classes
	- enumerated types
	- global class instances
	- static member functions.
