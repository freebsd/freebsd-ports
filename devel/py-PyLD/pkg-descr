This library is an implementation of the JSON-LD specification in Python.

JSON-LD is designed as a light-weight syntax that can be used to
express Linked Data. It is primarily intended to be a way to express
Linked Data in JavaScript and other Web-based programming environments.
It is also useful when building interoperable Web Services and when
storing Linked Data in JSON-based document storage engines. It is
practical and designed to be as simple as possible, utilizing the
large number of JSON parsers and existing code that is in use today.
It is designed to be able to express key-value pairs, RDF data,
RDFa data, Microformats data, and Microdata. That is, it supports
every major Web-based structured data model in use today.

The syntax does not require many applications to change their JSON,
but easily add meaning by adding context in a way that is either
in-band or out-of-band. The syntax is designed to not disturb already
deployed systems running on JSON, but provide a smooth migration
path from JSON to JSON with added semantics. Finally, the format
is intended to be fast to parse, fast to generate, stream-based and
document-based processing compatible, and require a very small
memory footprint in order to operate.
