TinyQ is a stripped down version of Qt 3 that has been put together to use
as a backend library. It provides all the necessary library classes to
comfortably develop in a C++ environment. This includes UTF8 and ASCII
strings, type optimized collections (dictionary, map, cache, vector, list),
regular expressions, filesystem access, URL processing, threads, shared
library handling, user settings, date and time handling, DOM & SAX XML
parsers, optimized data and text streams and abstract IO devices.
