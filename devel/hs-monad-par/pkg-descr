This library offers an alternative parallel programming API to that
provided by the 'parallel' package. The Par monad allows the simple
description of parallel computations, and can be used to add parallelism
to pure Haskell code. The basic API is straightforward: the monad
supports forking and simple communication in terms of IVars. The library
comes with an efficient work-stealing implementation, but the internals
are also exposed so that you can build your own scheduler if necessary.
