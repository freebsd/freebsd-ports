Notes on using the Arduino IDE:

To allow serial port locking, add your user to the dialer group:
    pw groupmod dialer -m myuser

User settings are in ~/.arduino/preferences.txt.  Edit the file
when the IDE is not running.

Setting the launcher for help files:
    launcher=firefox

Showing what the IDE is doing for build and upload commands (only
visible if you started the IDE from a console):
    build.verbose=true
    upload.verbose=true

To start the IDE:
    %%PREFIX%%/bin/arduino
