AVCE00 is an Open Source ANSI-C library that makes Arc/Info (binary) Vector
Coverages appear as E00! It allows you to read and write binary coverages
just as if they were E00 files.

The C library can be easily plugged into existing E00 translators to add
support for binary coverages simply by replacing your existing translator's
read/write function with the functions provided by the library.
