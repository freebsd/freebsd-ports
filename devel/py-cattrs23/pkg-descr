cattrs is an open source Python library for structuring and unstructuring data.
cattrs works best with attrs classes, dataclasses and the usual Python
collections, but other kinds of classes are supported by manually registering
converters.

Python has a rich set of powerful, easy to use, built-in data types like
dictionaries, lists and tuples. These data types are also the lingua franca of
most data serialization libraries, for formats like json, msgpack, yaml or toml.

Data types like this, and mappings like dict s in particular, represent
unstructured data. Your data is, in all likelihood, structured: not all
combinations of field names or values are valid inputs to your programs. In
Python, structured data is better represented with classes and enumerations.
attrs is an excellent library for declaratively describing the structure of your
data, and validating it.

When you're handed unstructured data (by your network, file system,
database...), cattrs helps to convert this data into structured data. When you
have to convert your structured data into data types other libraries can handle,
cattrs turns your classes and enumerations into dictionaries, integers and
strings.
