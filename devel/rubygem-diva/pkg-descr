This library is an implementation of expression for handling things.
It replaces Retriever module of mikutter.

Diva::Model is a common interface of all resources handled by
mikutter. By handling data as a subclass of Diva::Model as necessary,
you can obtain a common interface and it is useful for cooperation
among mikutter plugins.
