The intent of File::ShareDir is to provide a companion to
Class::Inspector and File::HomeDir, modules that take a process that is
well-known by advanced Perl developers but gets a little tricky, and
make it more available to the larger Perl community.

Quite often you want or need your Perl module (CPAN or otherwise) to
have access to a large amount of read-only data that is stored on the
file-system at run-time.

On a Linux-like system, this would be in a place such as /usr/share,
however Perl runs on a wide variety of different systems, and so the use
of any one location is unreliable.

Perl provides a little-known method for doing this, but almost nobody is
aware that it exists. As a result, module authors often go through some
very strange ways to make the data available to their code.
