icu-le-hb is a library implementing the ICU Layout Engine (icu-le) API
using external HarfBuzz library for implementation. This is useful as
a compatibility layer to make applications using ICU Layout Engine to
use HarfBuzz without porting them to use the HarfBuzz API.

The code is mostly a trimmed down version of icu/source/layout, with
all shapers stripped out, and HarfBuzz integrated.
