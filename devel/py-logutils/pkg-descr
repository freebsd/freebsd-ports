The logutils package provides a set of handlers for the Python standard
library's logging package.

Some of these handlers are out-of-scope for the standard library, and so
they are packaged here. Others are updated versions which have appeared
in recent Python releases, but are usable with older versions of Python
and so are packaged here.
