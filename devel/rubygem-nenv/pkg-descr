Using ENV in Ruby is like using raw SQL statements - it feels wrong, because it
is. If you agree, this gem is for you.

The benefits over using ENV directly:
- much friendlier stubbing in tests
- you no longer have to care whether false is "0" or "false" or whatever
- NO MORE ALL CAPS EVERYWHERE!
- keys become methods
- namespaces which can be passed around as objects
- you can subclass!
- you can marshal/unmarshal your own types automatically!
- strict mode saves you from doing validation yourself
- and there's more to come...
- it's designed to be as lightweight and as fast as possible compared to ENV
- designed to be both hackable and convenient
