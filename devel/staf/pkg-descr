The Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF) is an open source,
multi-platform, multi-language framework designed around the idea of reusable
components, called services (such as process invocation, resource management,
logging, and monitoring).

STAF removes the tedium of building an automation infrastructure, thus enabling
you to focus on building your automation solution.

The STAF framework provides the foundation upon which to build higher level
solutions, and provides a pluggable approach supported across a large variety of
platforms and languages.
