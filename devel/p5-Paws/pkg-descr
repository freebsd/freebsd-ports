This project is attempting to build an entire AWS SDK from the
information that is stored in other AWS SDKs.  Other AWS SDKs have a
"data-driven" approach, meaning that the definitions for the method
calls are stored in a data structure describing input and output
parameters.

The project is actually generating all of it's classes from botocore.
