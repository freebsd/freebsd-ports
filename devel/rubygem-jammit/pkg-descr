Jammit is an industrial strength asset packaging library for Rails,
providing both the CSS and JavaScript concatenation and compression
that you'd expect, as well as YUI Compressor and Closure Compiler
compatibility, ahead-of-time gzipping, built-in JavaScript template
support, and optional Data-URI / MHTML image embedding.
