Though dcons(4) is loaded as a modules by default in this port,
I recommend you to link it to kernel statically for several
reasons especially when used with gdb.

On -current, thanks to multiple console device support(conscontrol(8)),
we can use both syscons(4) and dcons(4) as console and DDB port at the
same time.

On -stable, because only one console device is allowed, we have to
hijack the console port from syscons(4) to use dcons(4) as the
console. (Define FORCE_CONSOLE to 1 in dcons.c for this.)  Even it
is not used as console, it can still be used as GDB(not DDB) port.

See %%DOCSDIR%%/README.dcons and manpage of dcons(4)
and dconschat(8) for details.
