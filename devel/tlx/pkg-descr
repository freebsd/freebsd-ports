tlx is a collection of C++ helpers and extensions universally needed, but not
found in the STL. The most important design goals and conventions are:
* high modularity with as little dependencies between modules as possible.
* attempt to never break existing interfaces.
* compile on all platforms with C++ - smartphones, supercomputers, windows, etc.
* zero external dependencies: no additional libraries are required.
* warning and bug-freeness on all compilers.
* keep overhead down - small overall size such that is can be included without
  bloating applications.
