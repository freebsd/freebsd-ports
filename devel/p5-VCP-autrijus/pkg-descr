vcp is a tool for copying revision controlled files between various SCM
repositories.  For example, using vcp, it is possible to copy the contents
of a entire Perforce depot (or part of one) into a depot on a different
Perforce server or to copy the contents of a CVS repository into a Perforce
server (or vice-versa).

This port is a private snapshot because p5-VCP's distribution files is
gone from the MASTER_SITE, and does not currently work with svk.
