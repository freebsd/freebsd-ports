Before starting the application, set a P4VRES variable to identify the
location of the p4v resources directory. For example:

	% setenv P4VRES %%PREFIX%%/share/P4VResources

The application is compiled for FreeBSD 4.4, so be sure to have appropriate
compatibility libraries (and kernel support, if applicable) installed on
your system.
