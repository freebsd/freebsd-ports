Dia2Code is a small utility used to generate code from a Dia diagram.
Dia is a program to make diagrams (ports/graphics/dia)

   - Reads UML diagrams.
   - Can handle UML - Generalization, UML - Realization and UML - Implements.
   - Selective code generation.
   - User-defined output directory.
   - Stereotype handling: interfaces, abstract classes.
   - "Import" and "include" based on the parent classes, the type of
     attributes and return type of methods if they're declared in the same
     diagram.
   - Support for JavaBeans(tm): will create automagically methods to access
     and modify each attribute.

This is a complete rewrite of dia2code in C++ contributed by Vincent Le Garrec.
