munch is a fork of David Schoonover's Bunch package, providing similar 
functionality. 99% of the work was done by him, and the fork was made mainly 
for lack of responsiveness for fixes and maintenance on the original code.

Munch is a dictionary that supports attribute-style access, a la JavaScript.
