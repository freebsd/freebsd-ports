The SMV (Symbolic Model Verifier) system is a tool for
checking finite state systems against specifications
in the temporal logic CTL (Computational Tree Logic).

One specifies the finite state system (finite automaton,
Mealy machine, full adder circuit, ..) as a Kripke
structure in the SMV language and provides specifications
in CTL. The model checking algorithm allows to determine
if the Kripke structure fulfills the specifications.
