FasterCSV is intended as a replacement to Ruby's standard CSV library. It
was designed to address concerns users of that library had and it has three
primary goals:
   1. Be significantly faster than CSV while remaining a pure Ruby library.
   2. Use a smaller and easier to maintain code base. (We're about even now,
      but not if you compare the features!)
   3. Improve on the CSV interface.
