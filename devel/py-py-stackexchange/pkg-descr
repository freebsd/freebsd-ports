Py-StackExchange is a simple Python binding for the StackExchange API.

Py-StackExchange API coverage:
- Access any StackExchange site, with just its URL. Even those that aren't
  online yet.
- If you just can't decide which one to use, you can use StackAuth to look up
  the full list of sites.
- Once you're online, you can view everything about users, questions, answers,
  badges, comments and tags.
- You can even go back in time by playing with post revisions.
- Help users by looking up every StackExchange account they have. Every single
  one.
- See how well an SE site is doing; check its site statistics.
- Search the questions of StackExchange sites.
