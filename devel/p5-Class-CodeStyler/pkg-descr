Class::CodeStyler is an object oriented API to be used by code-generators
in producing formatted code (Perl, C, other). The produced code file can
also be syntax checked, displayed with line numbers, executed, and eval'd.
Code can be inserted anywhere in the generated program using a system of
bookmarks and jumps.
