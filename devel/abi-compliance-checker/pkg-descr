Given the header files and shared objects corresponding to two different shared
library versions, and a simple description of each of the shared libraries in
XML format, abi-compliance-checker searches for the following kinds of binary
compatibility problems:

--added/withdrawn interfaces (functions, global variables)
--changes to constants
--problems in data types:
	--classes: added/withdrawn virtual functions (changes in layout of
		virtual table), virtual function positions, virtual function
		redefinitions
	--structural data types: added/withdrawn members (changes in layout of
		type structure), changes in members, size changes
	--enumerations: member value changes
--interface problems:
	--parameter and return type changes
	--incorrect symbol versions

The checker then generates a report that assesses the risks of any potential
problems detected.
