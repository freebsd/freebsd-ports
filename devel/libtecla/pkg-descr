The tecla library provides UNIX and LINUX programs with interactive
command line editing facilities, similar to those of the Unix tcsh
shell. In addition to simple command-line editing, it supports recall
of previously entered command lines, TAB completion of file names or
other tokens, and in-line wild-card expansion of file names. The
internal functions which perform file-name completion and wild-card
expansion are also available externally for optional use by programs,
along with a module for tab-completion and lookup of file names in a
list of directories. 

Note that special care has been taken to allow the use of this library
in threaded programs. The option to enable this is discussed in the
Makefile, and specific discussions of thread safety are presented in
the included man pages.
