Swarm is a software package for multi-agent simulation of complex
systems being developed at The Santa Fe Institute. Swarm is intended
to be a useful tool for researchers in a variety of disciplines,
especially artificial life. The basic architecture of Swarm is the
simulation of collections of concurrently interacting agents: with
this architecture, we can implement a large variety of agent based
models. Our initial target is Unix machines running GNU Objective C
and X windows: the source code is freely available under GNU Licensing
terms.
