CVS Monitor is an CVS repository browser.  It provides visibility of
activity in CVS to developers, management, and the general public.

Features:

* Look at any repository anywhere - CVS Monitor can act on any repository
that has at least a public read-only account, even if you don't own the
repository

* Aggressive Caching - all statistics, and most pages, are generated purely
from the cached information

* ChangeSet Visibility - present changes to the repository in ChangeSets,
a single change involves new revisions on multiple files

* Tracker Integration - CVS Monitor can be easily integrated with your Bug
tracking or Request tracking systems
