GNU Network Object Model Environment

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-port" that depends on other GNOME 2.0 packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the GNOME 2.0 development stuff pulled in by the port/package 
dependency mechanism.
