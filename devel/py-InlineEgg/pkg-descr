InlineEgg is a Python module that provides the user with a toolbox of
convenient classes for writing small assembly programs. Only that instead of
having to remember confusing assembly mnemonics and requiring the developer
to remember how to use complex tools like assemblers and linkers, everything
is done the easy way: in Python. InlineEgg is oriented - but not limited -
to developing shellcode (sometimes called eggs) for use in exploits.
