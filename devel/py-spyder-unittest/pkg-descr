Spyder-unittest is a plugin that integrates popular unit test frameworks with
Spyder, allowing you to run test suites and view the results in the IDE.

The plugin supports the unittest module in the Python standard library as well
as the pytest and nose testing frameworks. Support for pytest is most complete
at the moment.
