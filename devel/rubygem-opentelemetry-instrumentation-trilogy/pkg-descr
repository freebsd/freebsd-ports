The OpenTelemetry Trilogy Ruby gem provides instrumentation for Trilogy and was
COPY+PASTE+MODIFIED from the OpenTelemetry MySQL gem.

Some key differences in this instrumentation are:
- Trilogy does not expose MySql#query_options, therefore there is limited
  support for database semantic conventions.
- SQL Obfuscation is enabled by default to mitigate restricted data leaks.
