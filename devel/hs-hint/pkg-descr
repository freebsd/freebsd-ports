This library defines an Interpreter monad.  It allows to load Haskell
modules, browse them, type-check and evaluate strings with Haskell
expressions and even coerce them into values.  The library is
thread-safe and type-safe (even the coercion of expressions to values).
It is, essentially, a huge subset of the GHC API wrapped in a simpler
API.
