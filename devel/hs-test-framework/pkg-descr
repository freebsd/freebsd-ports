Allows tests such as QuickCheck properties and HUnit test cases to be
assembled into test groups, run in parallel (but reported in
deterministic order, to aid diff interpretation) and filtered and
controlled by command line options. All of this comes with colored test
output, progress reporting and test statistics output.
