Rapid YAML or ryml, for short. ryml is a C++ library to parse and emit YAML,
and do it fast.

ryml parses both read-only and in-situ source buffers; the resulting data nodes
hold only views to sub-ranges of the source buffer. No string copies or
duplications are done, and no virtual functions are used. The data tree is a
flat index-based structure stored in a single array. Serialization happens only
at your direct request, after parsing / before emitting. Internally, the data
tree representation stores only strings and has no knowledge of types, but of
course, every node can have a YAML type tag. ryml makes it easy and fast to
read and modify the data tree.
