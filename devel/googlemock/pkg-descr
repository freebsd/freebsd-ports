Inspired by jMock, EasyMock, and Hamcrest, and designed with C++'s specifics
in mind, Google C++ Mocking Framework (or Google Mock for short) is a library
for writing and using C++ mock classes. Google Mock:

    * lets you create mock classes trivially using simple macros,
    * supports a rich set of matchers and actions,
    * handles unordered, partially ordered, or completely ordered expectations,
    * is extensible by users, and
    * works on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
