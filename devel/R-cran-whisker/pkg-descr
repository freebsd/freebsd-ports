Whisker is a {{Mustache}} implementation in R confirming to the Mustache
specification. Mustache is a logicless templating language, meaning that no
programming source code can be used in your templates. This may seem very
limited, but Mustache is nonetheless powerful and has the advantage of being
able to be used unaltered in many programming languages. It makes it very easy
to write a web application in R using Mustache templates which could also be
re-used for client-side rendering with "Mustache.js".

Mustache (and therefore whisker) takes a simple, but different, approach to
templating compared to most templating engines. Most templating libraries, such
as Sweave, knitr and brew, allow the user to mix programming code and text
throughout the template. This is powerful, but ties your template directly to a
programming language and makes it difficult to seperate programming code from
templating code.

Whisker, on the other hand, takes a Mustache template and uses the variables of
the current environment (or the supplied list) to fill in the variables.
