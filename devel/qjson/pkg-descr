JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
format. It can represent integers, real numbers, strings, an ordered
sequence of values, and a collection of name/value pairs.

QJson is a Qt-based library that maps JSON data to QVariant objects
and vice versa. JSON arrays will be mapped to QVariantList instances,
while JSON objects will be mapped to QVariantMap.
