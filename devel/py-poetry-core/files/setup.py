This project is intended to be a light weight, fully compliant,\nself-contained package allowing PEP 517 compatible build frontends to build Poetry managed projects.\n\n## Usage\nIn most cases, the usage of this package is transparent to the end-user as it is either made use by Poetry itself\nor a PEP 517 frontend (eg: `pip`).\n\nIn order to enable the use `poetry-core` as your build backend, the following snippet must be present in your\nproject\'s `pyproject.toml` file.\n\n```toml\n[build-system]\nrequires = ["poetry-core"]\nbuild-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"\n```\n\nOnce this is present, a PEP 517 frontend like `pip` can build and install your project from source without the need\nfor Poetry or any of its dependencies.\n\n```shell\n# install to current environment\npip install /path/to/poetry/managed/project\n\n# build a wheel package\npip wheel /path/to/poetry/managed/project\n```\n\n## Why is this required?\nPrior to the release of version `1.1.0`, Poetry was a project management tool that included a PEP 517\nbuild backend. This was inefficient and time consuming when a PEP 517 build was required. For example,\nboth `pip` and `tox` (with isolated builds) would install Poetry and all dependencies it required. Most of these\ndependencies are not required when the objective is to simply build either a source or binary distribution of your\nproject.\n\nIn order to improve the above situation, `poetry-core` was created. Shared functionality pertaining to PEP 517 build\nbackends, including reading lock file, `pyproject.toml` and building wheel/sdist, were implemented in this package. This\nmakes PEP 517 builds extremely fast for Poetry managed packages.\n',
