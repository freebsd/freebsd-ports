Pathutil tries to be a faster pure Ruby impelementation of Pathname. It arose
out of a need to fix basic problems with Pathname, such as suscepetibility to
join overrides, need for automatic encoding, and normalization (for stuff like
Jekyll) and the ability to do other safe-style operations in an encapsulated
format, like copying files and folders with symlinks but only if they originate
from the given root.
