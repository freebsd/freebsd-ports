A vault is a persistent store for values of arbitrary types.  It's like
having first-class access to the storage space behind IORefs.  The data
structure is analogous to a bank vault, where you can access different
bank boxes with different keys; hence the name.  Also provided is a
locker type, representing a store for a single element.
