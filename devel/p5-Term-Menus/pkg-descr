Term::Menus allows you to create powerful Terminal, Console and CMD
environment menus. Any perl script used in a Terminal, Console or CMD
environment can now include a menu facility that includes sub-menus,
forward and backward navigation, single or multiple selection
capabilities, dynamic item creation and customized banners. All this
power is simple to implement with a straight forward and very
intuitive configuration hash structure that mirrors the actual menu
architecture needed by the application. A separate configuration file
is optional. Term::Menus is cross platform compatible.
