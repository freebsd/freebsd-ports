This package provides bindings to the generic input event interface in
Linux. The evdev interface serves the purpose of passing events
generated in the kernel directly to userspace through character
devices that are typically located in /dev/input/.

This package also comes with bindings to uinput, the userspace input
subsystem. Uinput allows userspace programs to create and handle input
devices that can inject events directly into the input subsystem.
