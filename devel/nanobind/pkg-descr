nanobind is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice
versa. It is reminiscent of Boost.Python and pybind11 and uses near-identical
syntax. In contrast to these existing tools, nanobind is more efficient:
bindings compile in a shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and have
better runtime performance.
