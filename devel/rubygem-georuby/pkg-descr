It is intended as a holder for data returned from PostGIS and the Spatial
Extensions of MySql. The data model roughly follows the OGC "Simple i
Features for SQL" specification (see http://www.opengis.org/docs/99-049.pdf),
although without any kind of advanced functionalities (such as geometric
operators or reprojections). It also supports various output and
input formats (GeoRSS, KML, Shapefile).
