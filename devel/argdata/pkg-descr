Argdata is a binary serialisation format similar to FreeBSD's nvlists.
It differs from nvlists in that it uses data types that are more similar
to YAML.

Argdata is used by CloudABI as a replacement for string command line
arguments and environment variables. CloudABI processes can start new
processes by passing them a YAML-like tree of arguments, having file
descriptors of resources annotated to the tree.

This package provides a native port of the Argdata library, so that it
can be used in native FreeBSD applications, but also to spawn CloudABI
processes appropriately.
