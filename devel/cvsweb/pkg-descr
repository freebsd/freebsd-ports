The cvsweb.cgi is a WWW CGI script that allows remote users to browse
a CVS repository tree via web.  It can display the revision history of
a file, as well as diffs between revisions and downloading the whole
file.

The cvsweb script has been written by Bill Fenner <fenner@FreeBSD.org>
for the FreeBSD project, improved visually and functionally by Henner
Zeller <zeller@think.de>, Henrik Nordstrom <hno@hem.passagen.se>, and
Ken Coar <Ken.Coar@Golux.Com>, to be adopted by the NetBSD project.

Akinori MUSHA <knu@FreeBSD.org> is adding more enhancements and doing
some cleanups over Zeller's version.

As space is lacking to list all the improvements over the original,
please refer to the documents after the installation.
