This is a simple, basic module for checking whether a class is a
Singleton. A Singleton describes an object class that can have only
one instance in any system. An example of a Singleton might be a print
spooler or system registry, or any kind of central dispatcher.

For a description and discussion of the Singleton class, see "Design
Patterns", Gamma et al, Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-201-63361-2.
