App::Control is a simple module to replicate the kind of functionality
you get with apachectl to control apache, but for any script or
executable. There is a very simple OO interface, where the constructor
is used to specify the executable, command line arguments, and pidfile,
and various methods (start, stop, etc.) are used to control the executable
in the obvious way.
