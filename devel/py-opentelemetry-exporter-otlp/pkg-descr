OpenTelemetry Collector Exporters is provided as a convenience to install all
supported OpenTelemetry Collector Exporters. Currently it installs:
- opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc
- opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http

In the future, additional packages will be available:
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-json-http

To avoid unnecessary dependencies, users should install the specific package
once they've determined their preferred serialization and protocol method.
