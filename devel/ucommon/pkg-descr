GNU uCommon C++ is meant as a very light-weight C++ library to facilitate using
C++ design patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for
systems using uclibc along with posix threading support. For this reason, GNU
uCommon C++ disables language features that consume memory or introduce runtime
overhead, such as rtti and exception handling, and assumes one will mostly be
linking applications with other pure C based libraries rather than using the
overhead of the standard C++ library and other similar class frameworks.
