GNU uCommon C++ is meant as a very light-weight C++ library to facilitate using C++
design patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for systems using
uclibc along with posix threading support. For this reason, GNU uCommon C++ disables
language features that consume memory or introduce runtime overhead, such as rtti and
exception handling, and assumes one will mostly be linking applications with other pure
C based libraries rather than using the overhead of the standard C++ library and other
similar class frameworks.
