This library provides support for supplying your machine's Application Default
Credentials to the OTLP Exporters created automatically by OpenTelemetry
Python's auto instrumentation. These credentials authorize OTLP traces to be
sent to telemetry.googleapis.com.

Currently telemetry.googleapis.com only supports OTLP traces, but eventually the
endpoint will support OTLP logs and metrics too.
