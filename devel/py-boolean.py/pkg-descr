This library helps you deal with boolean expressions and algebra with variables
and the boolean functions AND, OR, NOT.

You can parse expressions from strings and simplify and compare expressions. You
can also easily create your custom algreba and mini DSL and create custom
tokenizers to handle custom expressions.
