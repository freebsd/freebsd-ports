The Database Library for Robot Framework allows you to query a database and
verify the results. It requires an appropriate Python module to be installed
separately - depending on your database, like e.g. oracledb or pymysql.

The library consists of some keywords designed to perform different checks on
your database. Here you can find the keyword docs.
