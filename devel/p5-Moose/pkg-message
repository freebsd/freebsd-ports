This release has an incompatible change regarding how roles add methods
to a class!

Note that the release is incompatible with older versions of these modules:

        - MooseX::ClassAttribute    <= 0.07
        - MooseX::Singleton         <= 0.15
        - MooseX::StrictConstructor <= 0.07
        - MooseX::Params::Validate  <= 0.05
        - Fey::ORM                  <= 0.23

They will need to be updated.
