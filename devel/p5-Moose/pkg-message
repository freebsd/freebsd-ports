This release has an incompatible change regarding how roles add methods to a class!

Note that the release is incompatible with older versions of these modules:

        - MooseX::Singleton        <= 0.12
        - MooseX::Params::Validate <= 0.05
        - Fey::ORM                 <= 0.12

They will need to be updated.
