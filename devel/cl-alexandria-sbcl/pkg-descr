As a project Alexandria's goal is to reduce duplication of effort
and improve portability of Common Lisp code according to its own
idiosyncratic and rather conservative aesthetic. What this actually
means is open to debate, but each project member has a veto on all
project activities, so a degree of conservatism is inevitable.

This package is compiled with SBCL.
