Pidl is an IDL compiler written in Perl that aims to be somewhat
compatible with the midl compiler. IDL stands for "Interface Definition
Language".

Pidl can generate stubs for DCE/RPC server code, DCE/RPC client code and
ethereal dissectors for DCE/RPC traffic.

IDL compilers like pidl take a description of an interface as their
input and use it to generate C (though support for other languages may
be added later) code that can use these interfaces, pretty print data
sent using these interfaces, or even generate ethereal dissectors that
can parse data sent over the wire by these interfaces.

Pidl takes IDL files in the same format as is used by midl, converts it
to a .pidl file (which contains pidl's internal representation of the
interface) and can then generate whatever output you need. .pidl files
should be used for debugging purposes only. Write your interface
definitions in .idl format.

The goal of pidl is to implement a IDL compiler that can be used while
developing the RPC subsystem in Samba (for both marshalling/unmarshalling
and debugging purposes).
