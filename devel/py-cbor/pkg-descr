An implementation of RFC 7049 - Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR).

CBOR is comparable to JSON, has a superset of JSON's ability, but serializes to
a binary format which is smaller and faster to generate and parse.

The two primary functions are cbor.loads() and cbor.dumps().

This library includes a C implementation which runs 3-5 times faster than the
Python standard library's C-accelerated implementanion of JSON. This is also
includes a 100% Python implementation.
