This module adds XPath-style matching to your object trees. This means
that you can find nodes using an XPath-esque query with "match()" from
anywhere in the tree. Also, the "xpath()" method returns a unqique path
to a given node which can be used as an identifier.

NOTE: This module is not yet a complete XPath implementation. Over
time I expect the subset of XPath supported to grow. See the SYNTAX
documentation in the module POD for details on the current level of
support.
