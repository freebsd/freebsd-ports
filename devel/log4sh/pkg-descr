Log4sh is a logging framework for shell scripts that works similar to
the other wonderful logging products available from the Apache Software
Foundation (eg. log4j, log4perl). Although not as powerful as the
others, it can make the task of adding advanced logging to shell scripts
easier. It has much more power than just using simple "echo" commands
throughout. In addition, it can be configured from a properties file so
that scripts in a production environment do not need to be altered to
change the amount of logging they produce.
