UNIVERSAL::require - require() modules from a variable.

If you've ever had to do this...

    eval "require $module";

to get around the bareword caveats on require(), this module is for
you. It creates a universal require() class method that will work with
every Perl module and its secure. So instead of doing some arcane
eval() work, you can do this:

    $module->require;

It doesn't save you much typing, but it'll make a lot more sense to
someone who's not a ninth level Perl acolyte.
