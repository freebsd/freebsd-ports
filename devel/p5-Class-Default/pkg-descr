Class::Default provides a mechanism to allow your class to take static
method calls and apply it to a default instantiation of an object.  It
provides a flexibility to an API that allows it to be used more
confortably in different situations.

This technique appears to be especially usefull when writing modules
that you want to be used in either a single use or a persistant
environment.  In a CGI like environment, you want the simplicity of a
static interface.  You can call Class-method> directly, without having
to pass an instantiation around constantly.
