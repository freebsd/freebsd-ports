Class::Default provides a mechanism to allow your class to take static
method calls and apply it to a default instantiation of an object.  It
provides a flexibility to an API that allows it to be used more
comfortably in different situations.

This technique appears to be especially useful when writing modules
that you want to be used in either a single use or a persistent
environment.  In a CGI like environment, you want the simplicity of a
static interface.  You can call Class-method> directly, without having
to pass an instantiation around constantly.
