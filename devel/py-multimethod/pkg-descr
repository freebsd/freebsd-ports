Multimethod provides a decorator for adding multiple argument dispatching to
functions. The decorator creates a multimethod object as needed, and registers
the function with its annotations.

There are several multiple dispatch libraries on PyPI. This one aims for
simplicity and speed. With caching of argument types, it should be the fastest
pure Python implementation possible.
