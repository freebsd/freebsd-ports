Testinfra test your infrastructures.

With Testinfra you can write unit tests in Python to test *actual state* of
your servers configured by management tools like Salt, Ansible, Puppet,
Chef and so on.

Testinfra aims to be a Serverspec equivalent in python and is written as
a plugin to the powerful Pytest test engine.
