Ccdoc is a tool for extracting comments from C++ source code and presenting it
in HTML format, very similar to Java's JavaDoc tool. The tagging used in ccdoc
is very similar to that of Javadoc, with adaptations for the C++ specifics, of
course. Ccdoc supports extracting comments from both header and implementation
files.

In contrast to most other C++ doc'ing applications, ccdoc analyses the code
before it has been run through the pre-processor, so things such as macros can
actually be included in the documentation.

It's usage is not quite as straight forward as JavaDoc's, but considering the
quality of the output, it is well worth the effort.
