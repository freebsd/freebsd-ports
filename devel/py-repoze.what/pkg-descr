repoze.what is an authorization framework for WSGI applications,
based on repoze.who (which deals with authentication and
identification).

On the one hand, it enables an authorization system based on the
groups to which the `authenticated or anonymous` user belongs and
the permissions granted to such groups by loading these groups
and permissions into the request on the way in to the downstream
WSGI application.

And on the other hand, it enables you to manage your groups and
permissions from the application itself or another program, under
a backend-independent API. For example, it would be easy for you
to switch from one back-end to another, and even use this framework
to migrate the data.
