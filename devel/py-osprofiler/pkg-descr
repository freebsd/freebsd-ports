OSProfiler provides a tiny but powerful library that is used by most (soon to
be all) OpenStack projects and their python clients. It provides functionality
to be able to generate 1 trace per request, that goes through all involved
services. This trace can then be extracted and used to build a tree of calls
which can be quite handy for a variety of reasons (for example in isolating
cross-project performance issues).
