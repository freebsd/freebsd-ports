stdlibs provides a static listing of all known modules in the Python standard
library, with separate lists available for each major release dating back to
Python 2.3. It also includes combined lists of all module names that were ever
available in any 3.x release, any 2.x release, or both.

Note: On Python versions 3.10 or newer, a list of module names for the active
runtime is available sys.stdlib_module_names. This package exists to provide an
historical record for use with static analysis and other tooling.

This package only includes listings for CPython releases. If other runtimes
would be useful, open an issue and start a discussion on how best that can be
accomodated.
