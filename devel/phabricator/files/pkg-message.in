To run the phabricator daemons from startup, add phd_enable="YES"
to /etc/rc.conf. You can control the daemons using

service start
service stop
etc.

Before starting the daemons, please finish configuring your Phabricator
instance. This involves configuring a web server (Apache, NGINX, LightHTTP)
and a database server (MySQL, MariaDB). You can find detailed instructions
on how to finish your setup at:

https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/configuration_guide/

Please note that all files are located in %%PREFIX%%/lib/php/phabricator,
so if the documentation refers to ./bin, this means

  %%PREFIX%%/lib/php/phabricator/bin,

if it refers to webroot, this means

  %%PREFIX%%/lib/php/phabricator/webroot.

You might want to install textproc/py-pygments to improve syntax
highlighting.

Starting with version 20170630, phabricator daemons run as user www
by default. If you're updating from a version before 20170630 you will need
to fix permissions of /var/tmp/phd and repositories. Alternatively
you can continue to run phabricator daemons as root by adding
phd_user="root" to /etc/rc.conf.
