libdombey implements an SCGI application server which is incapable of
generating responses on its own.  The programmer writes an initialization
function and a function to generate responses, then compiles and links his
or her code against the library to create a complete multi-process SCGI
application server.

libdombey is intended for use in applications where client requests are
either GET requests or POST requests encoded with x-www-form-urlencoding.
It drops connections over which it receives POST requests encoded as
multipart/form-data.
