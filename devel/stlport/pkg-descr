STLport is an an adaptation of SGI's Standard Template Library.
The goal of the STLport effort is to make SGI's STL
implementation usable with most compilers while retaining full
functionality.

The Standard Template Library is a C++ library of container
classes, algorithms, and iterators providing many of the basic
algorithms and data structures of computer science.
