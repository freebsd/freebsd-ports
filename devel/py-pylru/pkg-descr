Pylru implements a true LRU cache along with several support classes. The cache
is efficient and written in pure Python. It works with Python 2.6+ including the
3.x series. Basic operations (lookup, insert, delete) all run in a constant
amount of time. Pylru provides a cache class with a simple dict interface. It
also provides classes to wrap any object that has a dict interface with a cache.
Both write-through and write-back semantics are supported. Pylru also provides
classes to wrap functions in a similar way, including a function decorator.
