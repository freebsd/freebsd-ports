SonarQube is now installed in %%PREFIX%%/%%APP_DIR%%.

Before the first start (but not if you update), you have to configure a DB in
    %%PREFIX%%/%%APP_DIR%%/conf/sonar.properties
A real DB server is recommended instead of the default local H2 DB. No testing
will be done for this port to handle an update for the local H2 DB (it is
recommended to only use the local H2 DB to evaluate this software).

Important information for the next steps:
    https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/requirements/requirements/
    https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-server/
    https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/instance-administration/security/
Note: the "wrapper" is not installed in FreeBSD, the FreeBSD daemon(8)
      facility is used instead.

Per default the server is started in supervised mode, this means if it dies
or is stopped via the admin interface (e.g. after updating/installing
plugins), it will automatically start again.

While the server is *not* running, you can switch from supervised to
unsupervised mode via:
    # sysrc sonarqube_supervised=NO

Temporary files are saved to
    %%TEMP_DIR%%
and are cleaned-up at every start.

Data files which are not saved to the DB are stored in
    %%DATA_DIR%%

Logfiles can be found in
    %%LOG_DIR%%

Once SonarQube is started, point your web browser to the page at
    http://<hostname>:9000/.
