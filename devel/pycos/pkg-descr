Pycos is a Python framework for concurrent, asynchronous, network, distributed
programming and distributed computing, using generator functions, asynchronous
completions and message passing. pycos can be used to create tasks with
generator functions, similar to the way threads are created with functions
using Python's threading module.  Programs developed with pycos have same
logic and structure as programs with threads, except for a few syntactic
changes - mostly using yield with asynchronous completions that give control
to pycos's scheduler, which interleaves executions of generators, similar
to the way an operating system executes multiple processes
