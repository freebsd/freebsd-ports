svn2git is a tiny utility for migrating projects from Subversion to
Git while keeping the trunk, branches and tags where they should
be. It uses git-svn to clone an svn repository and does some clean-up
to make sure branches and tags are imported in a meaningful way, and
that the code checked into master ends up being what's currently in
your svn trunk rather than whichever svn branch your last commit was
in.
