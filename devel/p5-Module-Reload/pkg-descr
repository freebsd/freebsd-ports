p5-Module-Reload
================

Similar to Apache::Reload, this module allows a running perl program to reload
all its libraries.  Very useful for developing perl servers.

When Perl pulls a file via require, it stores the filename in the global hash
%INC.  The next time Perl tries to 'require' the same file, it sees the file in
%INC and does not reload from disk.  This module's handler iterates over %INC
and reloads the file if it has changed on disk.
