                              WARNING!!!

Subversion is still pre-alpha software and should not be used in anything
even approaching a production environment.  The working copy and repository
formats are almost certainly going to change in ways that are not backwards
compatable, and Murphy's Law says that you will be the one that runs into
the nasty bug that munges all your data in a completely non-recoverable way.

If this hasn't scared you off yet, please use this port to download the most
recent development code from the main Subversion repository located at
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk, and report any bugs you encounter to
the development mailing list at dev@subversion.tigris.org.
