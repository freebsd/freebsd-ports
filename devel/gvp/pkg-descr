Go Versioning Packager

gvp stands for Go Versioning Packager and is based on gst, a similar tool
that provides dependency isolation for Ruby gems.

The tool modifies your GOPATH to point to a local .godeps/ directory so
that you can keep the dependencies of your project isolated there,
it also modifies GOBIN and PATH to include the new GOPATH/bin directory.

gvp is a companion tool to gpm but both tools can be used independently
from each other.
