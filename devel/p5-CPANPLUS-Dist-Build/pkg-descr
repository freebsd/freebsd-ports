CPANPLUS::Dist::Build is a distribution class for Module::Build
related modules.

Using this package, you can create, install and uninstall perl
modules. It inherits from CPANPLUS::Dist.

Normal users won't have to worry about the interface to this module,
as it functions transparently as a plug-in to CPANPLUS and will
just Do The Right Thing when it's loaded.
