The goal of the decorator module is to make it easy to define
signature-preserving function decorators and decorator factories. It also
includes an implementation of multiple dispatch and other niceties (please check
the docs). It is released under a two-clauses BSD license, i.e. basically you
can do whatever you want with it but I am not responsible.
