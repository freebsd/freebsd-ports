This module simplifies the routine job of selecting a random file. (As you 
can find at CGI scripts).  It's done, because it's boring (and 
errorprone), always to write something like

  my @files = (<*.*>);
  my $randf = $files[rand @files];

or

  opendir DIR, " ... " or die " ... ";
  my @files = grep {-f ...} (readdir DIR);
  closedir DIR;
  my $randf = $files[rand @files];

It also becomes very boring and very dangerous to write randomly selection 
for subdirectory searching with special check-routines.  The simple 
standard job of selecting a random line from a file is implemented, too.
