This Perl extension implements the BSD process resource limit functions

	getrusage()	getrlimit()	setrlimit()

and the BSD process priority functions.  These are available also via
core Perl but here we do more tricks so that the PRIO_* are available.

	getpriority()	setpriority()

Also is provided

	times()

which provides the same functionality as the one in core Perl, only with
better time resolution.
