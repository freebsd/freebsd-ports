DCD is not an IDE. DCD is designed to provide autocompletion for your favorite
text editor. If you are looking for an IDE, try one of these.

DCD consists of a client and a server. The client (dcd-client) is almost always
used through a text editor script or plugin, though it can be used from the
command line. The server (dcd-server) is responsible for caching imported
files, calculating autocomplete information, and sending it back to the client.
