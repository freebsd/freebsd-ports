Term::TablePrint shows a table and lets the user interactively browse it. It
provides a cursor which highlights the row on which it is located. The user can
scroll through the table with the different cursor keys.

If the table has more rows than the terminal, the table is divided up on as many
pages as needed automatically. If the cursor reaches the end of a page, the next
page is shown automatically until the last page is reached. Also if the cursor
reaches the topmost line, the previous page is shown automatically if it is not
already the first one.

If the terminal is too narrow to print the table, the columns are adjusted to
the available width automatically.

If the option table_expand is enabled and a row is selected with Return, each
column of that row is output in its own line preceded by the column name. This
might be useful if the columns were cut due to the too low terminal width.
