This is yet another file/directory handler that does a bit more than
Path::Class for some parts, and a bit less for other parts.  One of
the main difference is Path::Extended always tries to use forward
slashes when possible, ie. even when you're on the MS Windows, so that
you don't need to care about escaping paths that annoys you from time
to time when you want to apply regexen to a path, especially in file
tests that use 'like' or 'compare'.
