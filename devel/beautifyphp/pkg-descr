Beautify PHP
WWW: http://www.bierkandt.org/beautify/index.php

What it does:
This program tries to reformat and beautify PHP source code files automatically.
The program is Open Source and distributed under the terms of GNU GPL.
It is written in PHP and has a web frontend.

Who needs it:
- people, who get PHP code from other coders and are slightly confused
- people, who can't read their own PHP code anymore
- people, who want to share their PHP code

Basic features:
- automatic indentation of PHP source code according to given number of spaces
- automatic newlines, if required
- includes settings for braces according to C or PEAR style
- can make use of PHPs integrated code highlight option
- can limit number of chars per line. This will break the code at a space and
  outputs the rest on the next line with an additional indent. (I used this to
  reformat my code to put it in a LATEX document. This PHP code normally can't
  be executed anymore, it is only useful for printout.)
- turn off and on beautifying by inserting "// NO_BEAUTIFY" or "// BEAUTIFY"
  in source code
