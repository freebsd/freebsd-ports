Test::Log::Log4perl can be used to test that you're logging the right thing with
Log::Log4perl. It checks that we get what, and only what, we expect logged by
your code.

The basic process is very simple. Within your test script you get one or more
loggers from Test::Log::Log4perl with the get_logger method just like you would
with Log::Log4perl. You're going to use these loggers to declare what you think
the code you're going to test should be logging.
