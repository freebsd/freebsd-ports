This little program analyses the structure of FORTRAN source-code. As a
result you get a little flow diagram in which you can recognize which
SUBROUTINE is called by the program. Further all subroutines called from this
one are displayed. The indciation of the displayed names is a degree for the
level.

A new addition is the change of the starting point for an analysis. Instead to
check the whole source-code you can start with a special SUBROUTINE and see
the depence of this one.

The number of files which contain the routines are not restricted by the
program.

You can report the CALL- and/or SUBROUTINE-statements together with filenames
and line numbers to special files.
