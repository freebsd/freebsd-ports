xarray-simlab is a Python library that provides both a generic framework for
building computational models in a modular fashion and a xarray extension for
setting and running simulations using the xarray's Dataset structure. It is
designed for fast, interactive and exploratory modeling.

xarray-simlab is well integrated with other libraries of the PyData ecosystem
such as dask and zarr.
