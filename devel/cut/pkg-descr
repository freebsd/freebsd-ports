CUT is a simple, to-the-point unit testing system. It's different from
other unit test packages in that it follows the KISS principle. It's
designed for C testing, not designed to emulate SUnit.

CUT works with C, C++ and Objective-C.

CUT was primarily written by Samuel A. Falvo II and by Billy Tanksley,
starting life as distinct, and even competing, CUT 1.0 and test-assert
packages. When it was finally decided to combine both packages into a
single tool, CUT 2.0 was released, and found to be vastly more useful
than either expected. CUT 2.3 is the latest version of the CUT 2.x
series.

CUT follows standard error messages format supported by Emacs.
