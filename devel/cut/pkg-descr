CUT is a simple, to-the-point unit testing system. It's different from
other unit test packages in that it follows the KISS principle. It's
designed for C testing, not designed to emulate SUnit.

CUT works with C, C++ and Objective-C.

CUT was primarily written by Samuel A. Falvo II and by Billy Tanksley,
starting life as distinct, and even competing, CUT 1.0 and test-assert
packages. When it was finally decided to combine both packages into a
single tool, CUT 2.0 was released, and found to be vastly more useful
than either expected.

CUT follows standard error messages format supported by Emacs.
