Analogger is a fast asynchronous logging service and client library. It is
implemented in Ruby, and currently uses EventMachine in the server, though there
is a plan on the roadmap to enable it to run with a pure Ruby event reactor.

Analogger was originally written over a decade ago, in response to a need to
maintain a central logging server to accumulate logs from numerous web
applications to a single location. It takes very little time to send a logging
message, making it a very low impact logger for performance sensitive
applications. It has been continuously used in production since then, albeit in
a version not released publicly.
