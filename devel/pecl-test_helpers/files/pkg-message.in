*****************************************************************************
The php extension 'test_helpers' has been installed successful.
Add a line containing

	extension=%%PREFIX%%/lib/php/%%PHP_EXT_DIR%%/test_helpers.so

or

	zend_extension=%%PREFIX%%/lib/php/%%PHP_EXT_DIR%%/test_helpers.so

If this extension is used in combination with other extensions, such as Xdebug,
which are also overloading the `ZEND_NEW` opcode you have to load it as
`zend_extension` after loading the conflicting extension. This can be done in
your `php.ini` like this:

    zend_extension=xdebug.so
    zend_extension=test-helpers.so

Please refer to `phpinfo()` to verify whether a conflict was detected and
whether the work-around was enabled.
