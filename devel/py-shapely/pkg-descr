Shapely is a Python package for manipulation and analysis of 2D geospatial
geometries. It is based on GEOS (http://geos.refractions.net). Shapely 1.0
is not concerned with data formats or coordinate reference systems.
Responsibility for reading and writing data and projecting coordinates
is left to other packages like WorldMill and pyproj.
