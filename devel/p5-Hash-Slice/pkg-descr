Hash::Slice lets you easily make a deep slice of a hash, specifically a hash
containing one or more nested hashes. Instead of just taking a slice of the
first level of a hash in an all-or-nothing manner, you can use slice to take a
slice of the first level, then take a particular slice of the second level, and
so on.
