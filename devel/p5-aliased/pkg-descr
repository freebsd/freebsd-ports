aliased is simple in concept but is a rather handy module. It loads the class
you specify and exports into your namespace a subroutine that returns the
class name. You can explicitly alias the class to another name or, if you
prefer, you can do so implicitly. In the latter case, the name of the
subroutine is the last part of the class name.
