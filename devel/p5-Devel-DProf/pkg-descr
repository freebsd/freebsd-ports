The Devel::DProf package is a Perl code profiler.  This will collect
information on the execution time of a Perl script and of the subs in
that script.  This information can be used to determine which
subroutines are using the most time and which subroutines are being
called most often.  This information can also be used to create an
execution graph of the script, showing subroutine relationships.
