This package is a collection of hooks for PyInstaller and allows it to
work seamlessly when a package does not work with PyInstaller or has
data files that are needed at runtime.

Various hooks are avaiable.  A runtime hook helps the bootloader to
launch an app, setting up the environment. A package hook tells
PyInstaller what to include in the final application - such as the
data files and hidden imports.
