typeshed-client provides a way to retrieve information from typeshed and from
PEP 561 stub packages.

Example use cases:
- Find the path to the stub file for a particular module.
- Find the names defined in a stub.
- Find the AST node that defines a particular name in a stub.

Projects for which typeshed_client could be useful include:
- Static analyzers that want to access typeshed annotations.
- Tools that check stubs for correctness.
- Tools that use typeshed for runtime introspection.
