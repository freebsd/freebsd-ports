cvsdelta summarizes the difference between a CVS project and its local
version. It detects files that have been added and removed, and of
existing files it counts the number of lines that have been added,
deleted, and changed. It filters project changes by using .cvsignore
files, both system-wide and locally.

Requires ruby.
