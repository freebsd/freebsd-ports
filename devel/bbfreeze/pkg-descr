bbfreeze creates standalone executables from Python scripts.  It's similar
in purpose to the well known py2exe for Windows, py2app for OS X, PyInstaller
and cx_Freeze (in fact ancient versions were based on cx_Freeze.
And it uses the modulegraph package, which is also used by py2app).

It has the following features:

  - ZIP/Egg file import tracking
  - Binary dependency tracking (e.g. shared libraries)
  - Multiple script freezing support
  - Python interpreter included (named 'py')
  - Automatic pathname rewriting (pathnames in tracebacks are relative)
  - New distutils command: bdist_bbfreeze
