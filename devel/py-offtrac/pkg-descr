This is the Offtrac project. It aims to be a python based xmlrpc client
library for trac instances.

There is the offtrac python library which offers the TracServer class. This
object is how one interacts with a Trac instance via xmlrpc. An example
script (fedora-hosted.py) is provided to show how a client program might
make use of the library to get things done.
