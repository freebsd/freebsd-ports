GNU ccRTP is an implementation of RTP, the real-time transport protocol from
the IETF (see RFC 3550, RFC 3551 and RFC 3555). ccRTP is a C++ library based
on GNU Common C++ which provides a high performance, flexible and extensible
standards-compliant RTP stack with full RTCP support. The design and
implementation of ccRTP make it suitable for high capacity servers and
gateways as well as personal client applications.
