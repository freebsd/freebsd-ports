OCaml library package providing the `Genlex' and the `Stream'
modules which used to be part of the standard library of the
OCaml compiler before its version 5.0.

To ease the transition to OCaml 5, it is recommended for new OCaml
code to be compiled against this package, even if targetting on OCaml 4.x.

Beware that due to the value-type (in)equality, it is not possible to
mix values produced by this library and values produced by the OCaml
4.x standard library equivalent as if they were of the same type.
