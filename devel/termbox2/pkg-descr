termbox2 is a terminal rendering library for creating TUIs. It is an alternative
to the ubiquitous ncurses library. It ships with built-in support for popular
terminals and can also fallback to terminfo if present. Compared to the original
termbox, it retains a simple API and no dependencies beyond libc, and adds
stricter error checking, more efficient escape sequence parsing, opt-in support
for 32-bit color, extended grapheme clusters, code gen for built-in escape
sequences, a test suite, and more.

termbox2 is organized as a single file header library, though it is possible to
compile it as a stand-alone shared or static library.
