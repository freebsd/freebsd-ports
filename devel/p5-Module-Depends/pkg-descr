Module::Depends extracts module dependencies from an unpacked distribution
tree.

Module::Depends only evaluates the META.yml shipped with a distribution.
This won't be effective until all distributions ship META.yml files, so we
suggest you take your life in your hands and look at
Module::Depends::Intrusive.
