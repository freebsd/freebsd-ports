ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, is a language tool that
provides a framework for constructing recognizers, interpreters,
compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing
actions in a variety of target languages.  ANTLR provides excellent
support for tree construction, tree walking, translation, error
recovery, and error reporting.

This package provides the ANTLR v3 C runtime library.
