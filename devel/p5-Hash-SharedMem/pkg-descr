This module provides a facility for efficiently sharing mutable
data between processes on one host.  Data is organised as a
key/value store, resembling a Perl hash.  The keys and values
are restricted to octet (Latin-1) strings.  Structured objects
may be stored by serialising them using a mechanism such as
Sereal.
