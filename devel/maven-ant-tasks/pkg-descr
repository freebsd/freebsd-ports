The Maven Ant Tasks allow several of Maven's artifact handling features to be
used from within an Ant build. These include:

    - Dependency management - including transitive dependencies, scope
      recognition and SNAPSHOT handling
    - Artifact deployment - deployment to a Maven repository (file
      integrated, other with extensions)
    - POM processing - for reading and writing a Maven 2 pom.xml file
