Pyro is short for PYthon Remote Objects. It is an advanced and powerful
Distributed Object Technology system written entirely in Python, that is
designed to be very easy to use. Never worry about writing network
communication code again, when using Pyro you just write your Python
objects like you would normally. With only a few lines of extra code,
Pyro takes care of the network communication between your objects once
you split them over different machines on the network. All the gory
socket programming details are taken care of, you just call a method on
a remote object as if it were a local object!

Pyro provides an object-oriented form of RPC. You can use Pyro within a 
single system but also use it for IPC. For those that are familiar with 
Java, Pyro resembles Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI). It is less
similar to CORBA - which is a system- and language independent
Distributed Object Technology and has much more to offer than Pyro or
RMI. But Pyro is small, simple and free!
