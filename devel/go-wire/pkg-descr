Wire is a code generation tool that automates connecting components using
dependency injection. Dependencies between components are represented in Wire
as function parameters, encouraging explicit initialization instead of global
variables. Because Wire operates without runtime state or reflection, code
written to be used with Wire is useful even for hand-written initialization.
