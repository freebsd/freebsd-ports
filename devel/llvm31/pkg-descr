Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is:
- A compilation strategy designed to enable effective program
  optimization across the entire lifetime of a program.
- A virtual instruction set.
- A compiler infrastructure.
- LLVM does not imply things that you would expect from a high-level
  virtual machine. It does not require garbage collection or run-time
  code generation.
