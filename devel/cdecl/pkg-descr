Cdecl composes compilable C declarations and typecasts from descriptive
English phrases, and can also explain a complicated typecast or declaration.
It handles ANSI C, C++, pre-ANSI C, and K&R C, and has TAB completion of
keywords and line editing and history (provided by the GNU readline library).
