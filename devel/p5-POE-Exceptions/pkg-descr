POE::Exceptions extends POE to catch exceptions neatly.  A new signal,
DIE, is introduced.  This signal will be fired every time an exception
occurs.  (For those of you new to the term exception, an exception is
whenever the code decides to bail out by die'ing.) If the signal handler
returns 1 (as in the example above), POE will assume that the handler
dealt with the signal appropriately.  If the signal handler returns 0,
POE will assume that the handler does not want to deal with the signal
and POE will propgate the exception as if the handler never existed.

Caveat: POE::Exceptions will die on its own in the case of a double
exception fault.  If the DIE signal handler itself throws an exception,
POE::Exceptions will shut the program down and bail out.
