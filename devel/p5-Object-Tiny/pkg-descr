There's a whole bunch of class builders out there. In fact, creating a
class builder seems to be something of a rite of passage (this is my
fifth, at least).

Unfortunately, most of the time I want a class builder I'm in a hurry
and sketching out lots of fairly simple data classes with fairly
simple structure, mostly just read-only accessors, and that's about it.

Often this is for code that won't end up on CPAN, so adding a small
dependency doesn't matter much. I just want to be able to define these
classes FAST.

By which I mean LESS typing than writing them by hand, not more. And I
don't need all those weird complex features that bloat out the code
and take over the whole way I build modules.

And so, I present yet another member of the Tiny family of modules,
Object::Tiny.
