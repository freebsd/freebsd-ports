Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

This version provides the tiniest usable git experience, depending only upon
ftp/curl for http(s) support.

WARNING: This flavor cannot coexist with cvs, gui, p4 or svn subpackages.
