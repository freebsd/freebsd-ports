Devel::Platform::Info is a Perl module which provides a unified
framework for obtaining common platform metadata.

The module is a wrapper to the drivers which can determine platform
metadata regarding the operating system currently running.

The goal of the distribution is to furnish CPANtesters test reports with
information concerning key components of the platform currently being
used.
