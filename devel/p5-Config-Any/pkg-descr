Config::Any provides a facility for Perl applications and libraries to load
configuration data from multiple different file formats. It supports XML, YAML,
JSON, Apache-style configuration, Windows INI files, and even Perl code.

The rationale for this module is as follows: Perl programs are deployed on many
different platforms and integrated with many different systems.  Systems
administrators and end users may prefer different configuration formats than the
developers. The flexibility inherent in a multiple format configuration loader
allows different users to make different choices, without generating extra work
for the developers. As a developer you only need to learn a single interface to
be able to use the power of different configuration formats.
