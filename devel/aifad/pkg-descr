AIFAD stands for --Automated Induction of Functions over Algebraic
Datatypes-- and improves decision tree learning by supporting significantly
more complex kinds of data. This allows users to more conveniently describe
the data they want to have learnt, which can improve accuracy and complexity
of resulting models.
