AIFAD stands for --Automated Induction of Functions over Algebraic
Datatypes-- and improves decision tree learning by supporting
significantly more complex kinds of data. This allows users to more
conveniently describe the data they want to have learnt, which can
improve accuracy and complexity of resulting models.
