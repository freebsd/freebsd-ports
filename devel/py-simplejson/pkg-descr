simplejson is a simple, fast, extensible JSON encoder/decoder for Python

simplejson is compatible with Python 2.4 and later with no external
dependencies. It covers the full JSON specification for both encoding and
decoding, with unicode support. By default, encoding is done in an encoding
neutral fashion (plain ASCII with \uXXXX escapes for unicode characters).

The encoder may be subclassed to provide serialization in any kind of situation,
without any special support by the objects to be serialized (somewhat like
pickle).

The decoder can handle incoming JSON strings of any specified encoding (UTF-8 by
default).
