@comment | This file is normally created by `jpm install`. The problem is that
@comment | it uses the path from --tree for janet and the full path to that tree
@comment | for the image. Both wrong.
@comment | See work/janet-lsp-*/jpm_tree/bin/janet-lsp for the version with the
@comment | wrong paths that this replaces. It is this small.
