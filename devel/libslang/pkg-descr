S-Lang is a C programmer's library that includes routines for the rapid
development of sophisticated, user friendly, multi-platform applications.
The S-Lang library includes the following:

	-Low level tty input routines for reading single characters at a time.
	-Keymap routines for defining keys and manipulating multiple keymaps.
	-High level screen management routines for manipulating both
	 monochrome and color terminals.  These routines are very
	 efficient.
	-Low level terminal-independent routines for manipulating the display
	 of a terminal.
	-Routines for reading single line input with line editing and recall
	 capabilities.
	-Searching functions: both ordinary searches and regular expression
	 searches.
	-An embedded stack-based language interpreter with a C-like syntax.
	-A malloc debugging package
