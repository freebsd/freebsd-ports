Filter::Template is a Perl source filter that provides simple inline 
source code templates. Inlined source code can be significantly faster 
than subroutines, especially for small-scale functions like accessors and 
mutators. On the other hand, they are more difficult to maintain and use. 
Choose your trade-offs wisely.
