Filter::Template is a Perl source filter that provides simple inline
source code templates. Inlined source code can be significantly faster
than subroutines, especially for small-scale functions like accessors and
mutators. On the other hand, they are more difficult to maintain and use.
Choose your trade-offs wisely.
