Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming errors,
helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code smells (as defined in
Martin Fowler’s Refactoring book).

Pylint has many rules enabled by default, way too much to silence them all on a
minimally sized program. It’s highly configurable and handle pragmas to control
it from within your code. Additionally, it is possible to write plugins to add
your own checks.
