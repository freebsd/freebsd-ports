Pylint is a python tool that checks if a module satisfy a coding
standard. Pylint can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all
tests you can do with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. But
Pylint offers some more features, like checking line-code's length,
checking if variable names are well-formed according to your coding
standard, or checking if declared interfaces are truly implemented,
and much more.
