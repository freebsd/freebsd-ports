Fudge is a Python module for using fake objects (mocks, stubs, etc) to test
real ones.

This module is designed for two specific situations:
    * Replace an object
          o Temporarily return a canned value for a method or allow a method
            to be called without affect.
    * Ensure an object is used correctly
          o Declare expectations about what methods should be called and what
            arguments should be sent.

Fudge was inspired by Mocha which is a simpler version of jMock. But unlike
Mocha, Fudge does not automatically hijack real objects; you explicitly patch
them in your test setup. And unlike jMock, Fudge is only as strict about
expectations as you want it to be. If you just want to expect a method call
without worrying about its arguments or the type of the arguments then you
can.
