Recordclass is a MIT Licensed python library. It was started as a "proof of
concept" for the problem of fast "mutable" alternative of namedtuple. It
implements a factory function recordclass (a variant of collection.namedtuple)
in order to create record-like classes with the same API as
collection.namedtuple. It was evolved further in order to provide more memory
saving, fast and flexible types.
