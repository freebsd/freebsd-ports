Dispatcher mechanism for creating event models

PyDispatcher is an enhanced version of Patrick K. O'Brien's original
dispatcher.py module. It provides the Python programmer with a robust mechanism
for event routing within various application contexts.

Included in the package are the robustapply and saferef modules, which provide
the ability to selectively apply arguments to callable objects and to reference
instance methods using weak-references.
