This module is a simple interface to extensible logging.  It is
bundled with a really basic logger, Log::Contextual::SimpleLogger, but
in general you should use a real logger instead of that.  For
something more serious but not overly complicated, try
Log::Dispatchouli (see "SYNOPSIS" for example.)

The reason for this module is to abstract your logging interface so
that logging is as painless as possible, while still allowing you to
switch from one logger to another.
