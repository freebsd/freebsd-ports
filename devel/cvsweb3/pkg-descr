FreeBSD-CVSweb is a WWW CGI script that allows remote users to browse
a CVS repository tree via web.  It can display the revision history of
a file, as well as diffs between revisions and downloading the whole
file.

The cvsweb script has been written by Bill Fenner <fenner@FreeBSD.org>
for the FreeBSD project, improved visually and functionally by Henner
Zeller <zeller@think.de>, Henrik Nordstrom <hno@hem.passagen.se>, and
Ken Coar <Ken.Coar@Golux.Com>, then Akinori MUSHA <knu@FreeBSD.org>
brought it back to the FreeBSD community and made further
improvements.  FreeBSD-CVSweb is currently maintained by Ville Skytta.
