Ormolu is a formatter for Haskell source aiming to write code in such a way
so it's easy to modify and maintain. It implements one ?true?  formatting
style which admits no configuration, result in minimal diffs and is
compatible with modern dialects of Haskell.  Ormolu is well-tested and
robust so that the formatter can be used in large projects.
