Git::Version::Compare contains a selection of subroutines that make dealing with
Git-related things (like versions) a little bit easier.

The strings to compare can be version numbers, tags from git.git or the output
of git version or git describe.

These routines collect the knowledge about Git versions that was accumulated
while developing Git::Repository.
