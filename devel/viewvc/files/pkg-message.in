*****************************************************************

If you would like to set up ViewVC in a usable manner, all
you need to do is modify the configuration file, located at
%%INSTDIR%%/viewvc.conf, to note where your
CVSROOT is, and then copy the actual CGI (located at
%%INSTDIR%%/bin/cgi/viewvc.cgi) to your cgi-bin.
