*****************************************************************

If you would like to set up ViewVC in a usable manner, all
you need to do is modify the configuration file, located at
%%INSTDIR%%/viewvc.conf, to note where your
CVSROOT is, and then copy the actual CGI (located at
%%INSTDIR%%/bin/cgi/viewvc.cgi) to your cgi-bin.
Please notice that  configuration files are installed as
".dist" and must be copied to their actual names prior to
be edited, e.g.:
$ cd %%INSTDIR%%
$ cp viewvc.conf.dist viewvc.conf
$ cp cvsgraph.conf.dist cvsgraph.conf
It's up to yo to check the ".dist" files after upgrades.
