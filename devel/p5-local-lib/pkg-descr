This module provides a quick, convenient way of bootstrapping a
user-local Perl module library located within the user's home
directory.

It also constructs and prints out for the user the list of environment
variables using the syntax appropriate for the user's current shell
(as specified by the SHELL environment variable), suitable for
directly adding to one's shell configuration file.
