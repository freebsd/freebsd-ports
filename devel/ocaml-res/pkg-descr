This OCaml-library consists of a set of modules which implement
automatically resizing (= reallocating) data structures that consume
a contiguous part of memory. This allows appending and removing of
elements to/from arrays (both boxed and unboxed), strings (-> buffers),
bit strings and weak arrays while still maintaining fast constant-time
access to elements.

There are also functors that allow the generation of similar modules
which use different reallocation strategies.
