The Rally REST Tookit for Python consists of a package that provides a
means to interact with entities and artifacts in your Rally
subscription. The full spectrum of CRUD operations is available in your
Agile Central (Rally) Workspaces and Projects, providing of course that
your Agile Central (Rally) subscription credentials enable you to
perform those operations. The toolkit insulates the package user from
having to make multiple requests to obtain the full set of qualifying
items by performing any subsequent "page" requests automatically. An
additional key feature is the ability to obtain entity sub fields that
may be references or collections via the familiar dot '.' notation.
