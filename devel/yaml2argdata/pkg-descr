Argdata is a binary serialisation format similar to FreeBSD's nvlists.
It differs from nvlists in that it uses data types that are more similar
to YAML.

Argdata is used by CloudABI as a replacement for string command line
arguments and environment variables. CloudABI processes can start new
processes by passing them a YAML-like tree of arguments, having file
descriptors of resources annotated to the tree.

This package provides a series of helper classes that are used by
utilities like cloudabi-run to parse and translate YAML to Argdata.
These classes are useful when building custom utilities for launching
CloudABI processes, such as CloudABI's Kubernetes daemon.
