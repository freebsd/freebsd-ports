Proc::SafeExec provides an easy, safe way to execute external programs.  It
replaces all of Perl's questionable ways of accomodating this, including
system(), open() with a pipe, exec(), back-ticks, etc.  This module will never
automatically invoke /bin/sh.  This module is easy enough to use that /bin/sh
should be unnecessary, even for complex pipelines.
