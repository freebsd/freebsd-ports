Config::AWS is a small distribution with generic methods to correctly parse the
contents of config files for the AWS CLI client as described in the AWS
documentation.

Although it is common to see these files parsed as standard INI files, this is
not appropriate since AWS config files have an idiosyncratic format for nested
values (as shown in the link above).

Standard INI parsers (like Config::INI) are not made to parse this sort of
structure (nor should they). So Config::AWS exists to provide a suitable and
lightweight ad-hoc parser that can be used in other applications.
