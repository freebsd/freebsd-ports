Mo is the bare minimum needed for Perl OO. Many times you'll want just a couple
more features. Don't worry. Mo's got you covered.

Mo simply loads the feature classes Mo::build, Mo::default, Mo::builder,
Mo::coerce, Mo::is and Mo::required. The first one supports BUILD constructing
and the other three add their magics to has. A Mo::Feature module can enhance
new, extends and has, and also add new export subs, or remove existing ones.
Features can also be combined for a single accessor. See Mo::Features for a list
of all the features and for an explanation of the Feature API.
