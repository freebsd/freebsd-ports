Opscode helpers for instrumenting Erlang apps with folsom metrics. Here you
will find the module oc_folsom that will help you standardize folsom metric
labels and a convenience function for instrumenting a bit of code such that you
capture the run time in a histogram and fire a meter metric all in one call
(oc_folsom:time/2).
