Provides a simple, quick means of serializing perl memory structures
(including object data!) into a format that PHP can deserialize() and
access, and vice versa.

NOTE: Converts PHP arrays into Perl Arrays when the PHP array used
exclusively numeric indexes, and into Perl Hashes then the PHP array
did not.
