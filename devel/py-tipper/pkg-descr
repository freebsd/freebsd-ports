Tipper is a small utility for dumping `stack tracebacks`_ of running
Python processes.

Included is a module that, when imported, installs a `signal handler`_
for `SIGUSR1`_. Running ``kill -SIGUSR1 [pid]`` will cause the process
to dump the current stack trace of each thread to
``$TMPDIR/tipper-[Unix timestamp]-[parent pid]-[pid].log``.
