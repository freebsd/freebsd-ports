FC++ is a library for functional programming in C++. Functional programming
is a programming paradigm in which functions are treated as regular values.
Thus, we can have functions that take other functions as parameters. The
former functions are called "higher-order" functions. A common feature of
functions is that they can be polymorphic. "Polymorphic" means that the same
function can be used with arguments of many types. FC++ is distinguished from
other libraries (including the C++ Standard Library) by its complete support
for polymorphism: FC++ polymorphic higher-order functions can take other
polymorphic functions as arguments and return polymorphic functions as results.
This is particularly useful (i.e., simplifies code) in C++ where type inference
is limited and we often need to pass polymorphic functions around and determine
their type later.

With FC++ you can define your own higher-order polymorphic functions, but the
library also contains a large amount of functionality that can be re-used as-is
in C++ programs. This includes infinite ("lazy") lists, useful higher-order
functions (like map, compose, etc.), a reference-counting facility that can be
used to replace C++ pointers, many common logical and arithmetic operators in
a form that can be used with higher-order functions, and more.
