Class::Generate is a Perl5 module to simplify creating class
hierarchies.  It offers typed or untyped scalar, array, and hash
members, required members, private members, methods (both
instance and class), and other common features of object-
oriented software development.  Of course, you can implement all
these things without a special module, but doing it via
Class::Generate is much, much more concise.  And futhermore,
it's much less error prone: if you are using Perl's -w flag,
Class::Generate will catch many class specification and usage
errors.
