       Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to
       providing simple control over terminal driver modes
       (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,) support for non-blocking
       reads, if the architecture allows, and some generalized
       handy functions for working with terminals. One of the
       main goals is to have the functions as portable as
       possible, so you can just plug in "use Term::ReadKey" on
       any architecture and have a good likelyhood of it working.
