This package bundles the minified Flot code (a jQuery plotting library)
into a Haskell package, so it can be depended upon by Cabal packages.
The first three components of the version number match the upstream flot
version.  The package is designed to meet the redistribution
requirements of downstream users (e.g.  Debian).
