Methods that simplify the setup of S3 generic functions and S3 methods. Major
effort has been made in making definition of methods as simple as possible with
a minimum of maintenance for package developers. For example, generic functions
are created automatically, if missing, and naming conflict are automatically
solved, if possible. The method setMethodS3() is a good start for those who in
the future may want to migrate to S4. This is a cross-platform package
implemented in pure R that generates standard S3 methods.
