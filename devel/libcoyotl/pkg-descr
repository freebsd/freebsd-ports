The Coyotl library collects several C++ tools that have proven useful
in many of my programs, but which aren't "big enough" to warrant
an individual library.

Key features of Coyotl include:
 -- A polymorphic collection of the best pseudorandom number generators,
    including the Mersenne Twister and Marsaglia's favorites.
 -- Utilities for floating-point numbers, including additional functions
    for trigonometry, least common multiple, greatest common denominator,
    rounding, and other purposes.
 -- A simple cross-platform command-line parser.
 -- A framework for generating random rectangular mazes.
 -- A template for fixed-point math based on different integer sizes
    and decimal point locations.
 -- Templatized sorting utilities (designed before Std. C++'s <algorithms>,
    but still useful)
 -- Validation tools for "Design by Contract" programming.
