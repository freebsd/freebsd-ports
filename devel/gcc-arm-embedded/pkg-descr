  FSF binutils/gcc/gdb toolchain for ARM Cortex-M & Cortex-R
processors (Cortex-M0/M0+/M3/M4, Cortex-R4/R5/R7).
 This port brings C and C++ compilers. Gloss and libc layer
are provided through newlib embedded C library.
 This is complete package prepated by "GNU Tools for ARM Embedded
Processors" project (which is maintained by ARM company itself).

It includes:
 binutils
 gcc 5.3 with LTO and GRAPHITE support.
 newlib optimized for speed
 newlib-nano optimized for
 two versions of libstdc++, optimized for speed and size.
 gdb without sim.

 All this is built with support for armv6-m, armv7-ar,
armv7-m and armv7e-m targets, armv7e-m with and without
FPU support and armv8-m too.
 This port gives bit-to-bit compatibility with "official"
embedded ARM toolchain for MacOS X, Linux and Windows.
