This library provides two modules:

 * System.IO.CodePage: a cross-platform module that exports functions which
   adjust code pages on Windows, and do nothing on other operating systems.

 * System.Win32.CodePage: On Windows, this exports functions for getting,
   setting, and analyzing code pages. On other operating systems, this module
   exports nothing.
