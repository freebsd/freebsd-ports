Jakelib2 is a cross platform C++ class library with a Java-like API. An
automatic garbage collector is used to take care of unused objects. External
libraries like PCRE or GTK+ are beeing integrated to provide the programmer
with a homogeneous, easy to use programming environment that covers every
day's tasks like string handling, data storage, networking, or GUI
programming.
