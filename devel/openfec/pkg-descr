OpenFEC is a library that provides Application-Level Forward Erasure
Correction (AL-FEC) codes, also known as Upper-Layers FEC (UL-FEC). The
core purpose is to add redundancy to data in order to recover from
erasures during transmission without requiring retransmission.
Implemented as high-performance C-language software codecs, OpenFEC
provides IPR-free, open AL-FEC codes positioned in the communication
stack for robust transmission and distributed storage applications.

The library serves as a platform for developers and researchers who need
to integrate forward error correction capabilities into their
applications, offering ready-to-use codecs, performance evaluation
environments, and documentation. It's designed for applications where
data loss during transmission needs to be recovered automatically,
making it suitable for reliable communication systems, streaming
applications, and distributed storage solutions where retransmission is
not feasible.

This package is a fork by the roc-streaming project with additional
bugfixes. The original project is hosted at https://openfec.inrialpes.fr
