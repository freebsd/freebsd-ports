This module allows you to read configuration data written in a
human-readable and easily-editable text format and access it as
a perl data structure. It also allows you to write configuration
data from perl back to this format.

The data format allows key/value pairs, comments, escaping of
unprintable or problematic characters, sensible whitespace
handling, support for Unicode data, nested sections, or blocks,
of configuration data.
