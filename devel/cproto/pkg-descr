Cproto is a program that generates function prototypes and variable
declarations from C source code.  It can also convert function definitions
between the old style and the ANSI C style.  This conversion overwrites the
original files, so make a backup copy of your files in case something goes
wrong.

The program isn't confused by complex function definitions as much as other
prototype generators because it uses a yacc generated parser.  By ignoring all
the input between braces, I avoided implementing the entire C language grammar.

Cproto is in the public domain, except for the configure script which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.  If you have any comments
or find any bugs, please let me know.
