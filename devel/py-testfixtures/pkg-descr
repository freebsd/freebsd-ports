TestFixtures is a collection of helpers and mock objects that are useful when
writing unit tests or doc tests.

If you're wondering why "yet another mock object library", testing is often
described as an art form and as such some styles of library will suit some
people while others will suit other styles. This library contains common test
fixtures the author found himself repeating from package to package and so
decided to extract them into their own library and give them some tests of
their own!
