Getting the current time sometimes is not very helpful
for testing scenarios.
Instead, if you could obtain a known value during the runtime
of a testcase will make your results predictable.

Why another Date Mocker?
I wanted something simple with a very concise usage pattern
and a mocked date should only exist and stay constant inside a scope.
After leaving the scope the current time should be back.
This lead to this tiny module.

This simple module allows faking a given date and time
for the runtime of a subsequent code block.
By default the on keyword is exported into the namespace
of the test file.
The date to get mocked must be in a format that is recognized
by DateTime::Format::DateParse.
