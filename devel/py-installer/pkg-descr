This is a low-level library for installing a Python package from a wheel
distribution. It provides basic functionality and abstractions for handling
wheels and installing packages from wheels.

- Logic for "unpacking" a wheel (i.e. installation).
- Abstractions for various parts of the unpacking process.
- Extensible simple implementations of the abstractions.
- Platform-independent Python script wrapper generation.
