BufferedTokenizer takes a delimiter upon instantiation, or acts line-based by
default. It allows input to be spoon-fed from some outside source which receives
arbitrary length datagrams which may-or-may-not contain the token by which
entities are delimited. In this respect it's ideally paired with something like
EventMachine.
