FLEXI-STREAMS provides "virtual" bivalent streams that can be layered on top
of real binary or bivalent streams.  These streams enable reading and writing
of character data in various single- or multi-octet encodings, which can be
dynamically changed.  The package also includes in-memory binary streams,
similar to string streams, for efficient handling of binary data.

This package is compiled with SBCL.
