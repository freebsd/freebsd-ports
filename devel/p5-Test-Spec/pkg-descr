Test::Spec is a declarative specification-style testing system for
behavior-driven development (BDD) in Perl. The tests (a.k.a. examples) are named
with strings instead of subroutine names, so your fingers will suffer less
fatigue from underscore-itis, with the side benefit that the test reports are
more legible.

This module is inspired by and borrows heavily from RSpec
(http://rspec.info/documentation/), a BDD tool for the Ruby programming
language.
