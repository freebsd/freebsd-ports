FireREST is a python library to interface with Cisco Firepower Management Center
REST API. The goal of FireREST is to provide a simple SDK to programmatically
interact with FMC.

Features

* Authentication and automatic session refresh / re-authentication
* Rate-limit detection and automatic backoff and retry behavior
* Automatic squashing of paginated api payloads
* Sanitization of api payloads for create and update operations (automatically
  remove unsupported elements like links, metadata from payload)
* Detailed logging of api requests and responses
* API specific error handling using various custom exceptions for typical
  errors (e.g. ResourceAlreadyExists, UnprocessAbleEntityError, ...)
* Support for resource lookup by name instead of uuid for all CRUD operations

Import api client

  from fireREST import FMC
