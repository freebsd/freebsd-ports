Fujaba Tool Suite 4

The primary topic of the Fujaba Tool Suite project is to provide an easy to
extend UML and Java development platform with the ability to add plug-ins.

* Fujaba Tool Suite combines UML class diagrams and UML behaviour diagrams to
  a powerful, easy to use, yet formal system design and specification language.
* Furthermore the Fujaba Tool Suite supports the generation of Java sourcecode
  out of the whole design which results in an executable prototype, ideally.
* Moreover the way back is provided, too (to some extend so far), so that Java
  sourcecode can be parsed and represented within UML.
