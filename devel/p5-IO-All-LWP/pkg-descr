This module acts as glue between IO::All and LWP, so that files can be
read and written through the network using the convenient IO:All
interface. Note that this module is not used directly: you just use
IO::All, which knows when to autoload IO::All::HTTP, IO::All::HTTPS,
IO::All::FTP, or IO::All::Gopher, which implement the specific
protocols based on IO::All::LWP.
