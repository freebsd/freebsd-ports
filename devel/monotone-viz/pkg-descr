Monotone-viz is a small GTK+ application that
visualizes monotone ancestry graphs.

Monotone is a free distributed version control system.
Monotone-viz is developed in the Objective Caml language,
using the GTK+ and libgnomecanvas libraries (via LablGTK,
an OCaml binding for GTK+), and it uses the dot program
from the Graphviz package.
