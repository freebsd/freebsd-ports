STXXL is an implementation of the C++ standard template library STL
for external memory (out-of-core) computations, i. e. STXXL implements
containers and algorithms that can process huge volumes of data
that only fit on disks.  While the closeness to the STL supports
ease of use and compatibility with existing applications, another
design priority is high performance.
