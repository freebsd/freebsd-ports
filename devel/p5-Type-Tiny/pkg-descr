Type::Tiny is a tiny class for creating Moose-like type constraint objects which
are compatible with Moo, Moose and Mouse.

Maybe now we won't need to have separate MooseX, MouseX and MooX versions of
everything? We can but hope...

This documents the internals of Type::Tiny. Type::Tiny::Manual is a better
starting place if you're new.
