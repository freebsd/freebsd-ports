Tie::File represents a regular text file as a Perl array. Each element in
the array corresponds to a record in the file. The first line of the file
is element 0 of the array; the second line is element 1, and so on.

The file is not loaded into memory, so this will work even for gigantic files.

Changes to the array are reflected in the file immediately.
