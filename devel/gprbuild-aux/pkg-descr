GPRbuild is an advanced software tool designed to help automate the
construction of multi-language systems.  It removes the complexity from
multi-language development by allowing developers to quickly and easily
compile and link software written in a combination of languages including
Ada, Assembler, C, C++, and Fortran.  Easily extendable by users to cover
new toolchains and languages it is primarily aimed at projects of all sizes
organized into subsystems and libraries and is particularly well suited for
compiled languages.
