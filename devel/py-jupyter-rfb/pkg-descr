The jupyter_rfb library provides a widget (an ipywidgets subclass) that can be
used in the Jupyter notebook and in JupyterLab to implement a remote
frame-buffer.

Images that are generated at the server are streamed to the client (Jupyter)
where they are shown. Events (such as mouse interactions) are streamed in the
other direction, where the server can react by generating new images.

This remote-frame-buffer approach can be an effective method for
server-generated visualizations to be dispayed in Jupyter notebook/lab.
For example visualization created by tools like vispy, datoviz or pygfx.
