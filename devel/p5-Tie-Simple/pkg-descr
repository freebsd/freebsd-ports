This module adds the ability to quickly create new types of tie objects without
creating a complete class. It does so in such a way as to try and make the
programmers life easier when it comes to single-use ties that I find myself
wanting to use from time-to-time.

The Tie::Simple package is actually a front-end to other classes which really do
all the work once tied, but this package does the dwimming to automatically
figure out what you're trying to do.

I've tried to make this as intuitive as possible and dependent on other bits of
Perl where I can to minimize the need for documentation and to make this extra,
extra spiffy.
