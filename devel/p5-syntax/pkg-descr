This module activates community provided syntax extensions to Perl. You pass
it a feature name, and optionally a scalar with arguments, and the
dispatching system will load and install the extension in your package.

The import arguments are parsed with Data::OptList(3). There are no
standardised options. Please consult the documentation for the specific syntax
feature to find out about possible configuration options.
