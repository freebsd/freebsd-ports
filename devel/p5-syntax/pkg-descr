This module activates community provided syntax extensions to Perl. You pass it
a feature name, and optionally a scalar with arguments, and the dispatching
system will load and install the extension in your package.

The import arguments are parsed with Data::OptList(3). There are no standardised
options. Please consult the documentation for the specific syntax feature to
find out about possible configuration options.
