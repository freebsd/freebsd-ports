Test::Mock::LWP::Dispatch intends for testing a code that heavily uses
LWP::UserAgent.

Assume that function you want to test makes three different request to the
server and expects to get some content from the server. To test this function
you should setup request/response mappings for mocked UserAgent and test it.

For doing something with mappings, here are methods map, unmap and unmap_all.
For controlling context of these mappings (is it applies for all created in your
code LWP::UserAgent's or only to one specific?) you should call these functions
for exported $mock_ua object (global mapping) or for newly created
LWP::UserAgent (local mappings).

See also on Test::Mock::LWP, it provides mocked LWP objects for you, so probably
you can solve your problems with this module too.
