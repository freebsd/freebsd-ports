This perl package uses perl5 objects to make it easy for manipulating 
spreadsheet data among disk files, database, and Web publishing.

A table object contains a header and a two-dimensional array of scalars. 
Three class methods Data::Table::fromCSV, Data::Table::fromTSV, and 
Data::Table::fromSQL allow users to create a table object from a CSV/TSV 
file or a database SQL selection in a snap.

Table methods provide basic access, add, delete row(s) or column(s) 
operations, as well as more advanced sub-table extraction, table sorting, 
record matching via keywords or patterns, table merging, and web 
publishing. Data::Table class also provides a straightforward interface to 
other popular Perl modules such as DBI and GD::Graph.
