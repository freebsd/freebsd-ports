The Inline::Java module allows you to put Java source code directly "inline"
in a Perl script or module. A Java compiler is launched and the Java code is
compiled. Then Perl asks the Java classes what public methods have been
defined. These classes and methods are available to the Perl program as if
they had been written in Perl.

The process of interrogating the Java classes for public methods occurs the
first time you run your Java code. The namespace is cached, and subsequent
calls use the cached version.
