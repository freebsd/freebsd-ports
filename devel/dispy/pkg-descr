dispy is a comprehensive, yet easy to use framework for creating
and using compute clusters to execute computations in parallel
across multiple processors in a single machine (SMP), among many
machines in a cluster, grid or cloud. dispy is well suited for data
parallel (SIMD) paradigm where a computation (Python function or
standalone program) is evaluated with different (large) datasets
independently with no communication among computation tasks (except
for computation tasks sending Provisional/Intermediate Results or
Transferring Files to the client). If communication/cooperation
among tasks is needed, Distributed Communicating Processes module
of pycos framework could be used.
