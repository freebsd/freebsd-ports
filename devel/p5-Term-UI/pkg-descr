Term::UI is a transparent way of eliminating the overhead of having to
format a question and then validate the reply, informing the user if the
answer was not proper and re-issuing the question.

Simply give it the question you want to ask, optionally with choices the
user can pick from and a default and Term::UI will DWYM.

For asking a yes or no question, there's even a shortcut.
