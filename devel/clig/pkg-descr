Clig generates C code to take apart the typical command-line arguments
given to a C program.  Input to clig is a simple description file that
specifies the name and number of options, their type (Flag, String,
Float, Int) and permissable range, and which options are mandatory.  From
this, clig will generate self-contained C code to include in your program,
a usage message, and a manual page skeleton.

Clig does a lot more than getopt!
