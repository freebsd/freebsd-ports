Daemon::Control provides a library for creating init scripts in perl. Your perl
script just needs to set the accessors for what and how you want something to
run and the library takes care of the rest.

You can launch programs through the shell (/usr/sbin/my_program) or launch Perl
code itself into a daemon mode. Single and double fork methods are supported and
in double-fork mode all the things you would expect like reopening
STDOUT/STDERR, switching UID/GID are supported.
