Netli Configuration library (NCNF) is the module for C applications to
efficiently read and use the configuration file contents.  NCNF converts
the on-disk configuration file structure to the memory-based tree of
configuration objects.  Basic NCNF API does not make a distinction
between different types of configuration objects.  However, there are a
couple of additional functions present to ease the use of certain types
of configuration objects.
