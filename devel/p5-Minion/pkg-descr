Minion is a job queue for the Mojolicious real-time web framework with support
for multiple backends, such as DBM::Deep and PostgreSQL.

A job queue allows you to process time and/or computationally intensive tasks
in background processes, outside of the request/response lifecycle. Among those
tasks you'll commonly find image resizing, spam filtering, HTTP downloads,
building tarballs, warming caches and basically everything else you can imagine
that's not super fast.
