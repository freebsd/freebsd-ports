Mill is your shiny new Java/Scala build tool!  Scared of SBT?
Melancholy over Maven?  Grumbling about Gradle?  Baffled by Bazel?
Give Mill a try!

Mill aims for simplicity by re-using concepts you are already
familiar with, borrowing ideas from modern tools like Bazel, to let
you build your projects in a way that's simple, fast, and predictable.

Mill has built in support for the Scala programming language, and
can serve as a replacement for SBT, but can also be extended to
support any other language or platform via modules (written in Java
or Scala) or through external subprocesses.
