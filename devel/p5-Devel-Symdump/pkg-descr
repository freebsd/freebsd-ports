       This little package serves to access the symbol table of
       perl.

       Devel::Symdump->rnew(@packages)

       returns a symbol table object for all subtrees below
       @packages.  Nested Modules are analyzed recursively. If no
       package is given as argument, it defaults to main. That
       means to get the whole symbol table, just do a rnew
       without arguments.

       Devel::Symdump->new(@packages)

       does not go into recursion and only analyzes the packages
       that are given as arguments.
