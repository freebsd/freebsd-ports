The IO::Like module provides all of the methods of typical IO implementations
such as File; most importantly the read, write, and seek series of methods.  A
class which includes IO::Like needs to provide only a few methods in order to
enable the higher level methods.  Buffering is automatically provided by default
for the methods which normally provide it in IO.
