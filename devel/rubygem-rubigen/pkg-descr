rubigen - Ruby Generator Framework

RubiGen is originally extracted from Ruby on Rails.

It is a framework to allow Ruby applications to generate file/folder stubs
(like the rails command does for Ruby on Rails, and the 'script/generate'
 command within a Rails application during development).

RubiGen exists to give different development environments their own generator
framework.
