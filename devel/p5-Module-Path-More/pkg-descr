Module::Path::More provides a function, module_path(), which will find where a
module (or module prefix, or .pod file) is installed locally. (There is also
another function pod_path() which is just a convenience wrapper.)

It works by looking in all the directories in @INC for an appropriately named
file. If module is Foo::Bar, will search for Foo/Bar.pm, Foo/Bar.pmc (if
find_pmc argument is true), Foo/Bar directory (if find_prefix argument is true),
or Foo/Bar.pod (if find_pod argument is true).
