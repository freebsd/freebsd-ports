Module::Dependency - Collection of modules for examining dependencies
                     between parents and children, like Perl files

A set of pure-perl modules and helper programs that let you build a
database of the dependency links between a collection of Perl files,
and then query that database, even producing text, HTML, PostScript
or graphical reports.

The database in question is actually a simple Storable image of a
Perl data structure, and you can create as many of these as you want.
You can use the command-line tools, or write your own Perl to query
and manipulate the data however you want.
