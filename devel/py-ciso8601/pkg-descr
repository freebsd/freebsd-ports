ciso8601 converts ISO 8601 or RFC 3339 date time strings into Python datetime
objects.

Since it's written as a C module, it is much faster than other Python libraries.

ciso8601 only supports a subset of ISO 8601, but supports a superset of what is
supported by Python itself (datetime.fromisoformat), and supports the entirety
of the RFC 3339 specification.
