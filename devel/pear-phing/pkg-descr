From the Phing homepage:

PHing Is Not GNU make; it's a PHP project build system or build tool based on
â€‹Apache Ant. You can do anything with it that you could do with a traditiona
build system like GNU make, and its use of simple XML build files and
extensible PHP "task" classes make it an easy-to-use and highly flexible build
framework.

Features include running PHPUnit and SimpleTest unit tests (including test
result and coverage reports), file transformations (e.g. token replacement,
XSLT transformation, Smarty template transformations), file system operations,
interactive build support, SQL execution, CVS/SVN/GIT operations, tools for
creating PEAR packages, documentation generation (DocBlox, PhpDocumentor) and
much, much more.
