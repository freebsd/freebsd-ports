universal-ctags has the objective of continuing the development from what
existed in the Sourceforge area. Github exuberant-ctags repository was
started by Reza Jelveh and was later moved to the universal-ctags organization.

The goal of the project is preparing and maintaining common/unified space
where people interested in making ctags better can work together.
