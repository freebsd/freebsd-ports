Dancer2::Plugin::LogReport provides easy access to the extensive logging
facilities provided by Log::Report. Along with Dancer2::Logger::LogReport, this
brings together all the internal Dancer2 logging, handling for expected and
unexpected exceptions, translations and application logging.

Logging is extremely flexible using many of the available dispatchers. Multiple
dispatchers can be used, each configured separately to display different
messages in different formats. By default, messages are logged to a session
variable for display on a webpage, and to STDERR.

Messages within this plugin use the extended Dancer2::Logger::LogReport::Message
class rather than the standard Log::Report::Message class.

Note that it is currently recommended to use the plugin in all apps within a
Dancer2 program, not only some. Therefore, wherever you use Dancer2 you should
also use Dancer2::Plugin::LogReport. This does not apply if using the same app
name (use Dancer2 appname, 'Already::Exists'). In all other modules, you can
just use Log::Report.
