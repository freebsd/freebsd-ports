Perl's require builtin (and its use wrapper) requires the files it loads to
return a true value. This is usually accomplished by placing a single

    1;

statement at the end of included scripts or modules. It's not onerous to add but
it's a speed bump on the Perl novice's road to enlightenment. In addition, it
appears to be a non-sequitur to the uninitiated, leading some to attempt to
mitigate its appearance with a comment:

    1; # keep require happy
or:
    1; # Do not remove this line
or even:
    1; # Must end with this, because Perl is bogus.

This module packages this "return true" behaviour so that it need not be written
explicitly. It can be used directly, but it is intended to be invoked from the
import method of a Modern::Perl-style module that enables modern Perl features
and conveniences and cleans up legacy Perl warts.
