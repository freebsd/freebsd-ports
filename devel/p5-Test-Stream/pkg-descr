This is not a drop-in replacement for Test::More.

Adoption of Test::Stream instead of continuing to use Test::More is a choice.
Liberty has been taken to make significant API changes. Replacing use
Test::More; with use Test::Stream; will not work for more than the most trivial
of test files.

See Test::Stream::Manual::FromTestBuilder if you are coming from Test::More or
Test::Simple and want a quick translation.

At the moment you cannot use Test::Stream and Test::Builder based tools in the
same test scripts unless you install the TRIAL Test::More version. Once the
Test::More trials go stable you will be able to combine tools from both
frameworks.
