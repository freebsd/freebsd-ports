If you've used Moose's native attribute traits, or MooX::HandlesVia before, you
should have a fairly good idea what this does.

Why re-invent the wheel? Well, this is an implementation that should work okay
with Moo, Moose, Mouse, and any other OO toolkit you throw at it. One ring to
rule them all, so to speak.

Also, unlike MooX::HandlesVia, it honours type constraints, plus it doesn't have
the limitation that it can't mutate non-reference values.
