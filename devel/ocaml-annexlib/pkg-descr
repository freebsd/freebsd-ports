An extension Library

This is mostly to fill in some gaps in the standard and Unix
libraries, either for completeness or because they're things I find
myself needing a lot of the time, and a few modules that aren't worthy
of being their own releases. Enjoy. Most of this used to be part of an
old library (stew) that I broke up into a couple of smaller ones. This
one /was/ extlib, now annexlib. Its companion is mathlib.
