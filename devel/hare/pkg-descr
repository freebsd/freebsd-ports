This is the Hare build driver and standard library.

Hare is a systems programming language designed to be simple, stable,
and robust. Hare uses a static type system, manual memory management,
and a minimal runtime. It is well-suited to writing operating systems,
system tools, compilers, networking software, and other low-level,
high performance tasks.
