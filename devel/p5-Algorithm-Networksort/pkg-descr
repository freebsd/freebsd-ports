This module will create sorting networks, a sequence of comparisons
that do not depend upon the results of prior comparisons.

There are several algorithms to generate sorting networks.  This
module has three of them:  Bose and Nelson's, Hibbard's, and
Batcher's Merge Exchange.  It also has networks that were found
to be superior in comparison count to those generated automatically
by these algorithms.

There is a flexible formatting function that will allow you to
print out your network in many ways (see documentation).  There
is also a graphical output function that will return the network
in an encapsulated postscript, SVG, or text form.
