Penguin::Easy
=============

This module came about by reading the Penguin mailing list, and looking for
a simple way to execute Penguin for those of you who are interested in using
it, but find that the damn thing has too many packages to include.

Woe is over, use Penguin::Easy, create the object, and run the damn
thing.  Simple.

Also included is my Penguin Install guide,  that was pushed around the
mailing list for quite a while.
