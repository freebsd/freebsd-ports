JRTPLIB is an object-oriented RTP library written in C++ by Jori Liesenborgs. 
It was partly developed for his thesis at the School for Knowledge Technology 
(or 'School voor Kennistechnologie' in Dutch), a cooperation between the 
'Limburgs Universitair Centrum' (LUC) and the 'Universiteit Maastricht' (UM). 

The latest version of the library is 2.7 (December 12, 2002)
