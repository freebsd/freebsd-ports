This library is necessary for property settings for some gnome applications.

The purpose of PL is to closely mimick the behaviour of the property
lists used in GNUstep/OPENSTEP (there formed with the NSString,
NSData, NSArray and NSDictionary classes) and to be compatible with
it. PL enables programs that use configuration or preference files to
make these compatible with GNUstep/OPENSTEP's user defaults handling
mechanism, without needing to use Objective-C or GNUstep/OPENSTEP
themselves.
