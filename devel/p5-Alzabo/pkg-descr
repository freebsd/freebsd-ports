Alzabo is a suite of modules with two core functions. Its first use is as a
data modelling tool. Through either a schema creation GUI, a perl program, or
reverse engineering, you can create a set objects to represent a schema.

Its second function is as an RDBMS to object mapping system. Once you have
created a schema, you can use the Alzabo::Runtime::Table and
Alzabo::Runtime::Row classes to access its data. These classes offer a high
level interface to common operations such as SQL SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, and
UPDATE commands.
