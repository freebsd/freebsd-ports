Exuberant Ctags indexing python bindings

Exuberant Ctags supports indexing of many modern programming languages. Python
is a powerful scriptable dynamic language. Using Python to access Ctags index
file is a natural fit in extending an application's capability to examine
source code.

This project wrote a wrapper for readtags.c. I have been using the package in
a couple of projects and it has been shown that it could easily handle hundreds
source files.
