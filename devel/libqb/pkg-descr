libqb is a library with the primary purpose of providing high-performance,
reusable features for client-server architecture, such as logging, tracing,
inter-process communication (IPC), and polling.

libqb is not intended to be an all-encompassing library, but instead provide
focused APIs that are highly tuned for maximum performance for client-server
applications.
