cvsd is a wrapper program for cvs in pserver mode. It will run 'cvs pserver'
under a special uid/gid in a chroot jail.

cvsd is run as a daemon and is controlled through a configuration file. It
is relatively easy to configure and tools are provided for easily setting up
a rootjail.

This server can be useful if you want to run a public cvs pserver. You should
however be aware of the security limitations of running a cvs pserver. If you
want any kind of authentication you should really consider using secure shell
as a secure authentication mechanism and transport. Passwords used in cvs
pserver are transmitted in plaintext and this wrapper won't change that.

This server adds a layer of security to cvs. cvs is a very powerful tool and
is capable of running scripts and other things. By running cvs in a rootjail
it is possible to limit the amount of "damage" cvs can do if it is exploited.
It is generally a good idea to run cvsd without any write permissions to any
directory on the system.
