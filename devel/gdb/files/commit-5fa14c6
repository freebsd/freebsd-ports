commit 5fa14c6b9789bad6f91dd21889f7b1a0eb75c6d0

    Enable ptrace events on new child processes.
    
    New child processes on FreeBSD do not inherit optional ptrace events
    such as fork and LWP events from the parent process.  Instead,
    explicitly enable events on new children when reporting a fork
    event.
    
    gdb/ChangeLog:
    
    	* fbsd-nat.c (fbsd_wait): Use "fbsd_enable_proc_events" on
    	new child processes.
