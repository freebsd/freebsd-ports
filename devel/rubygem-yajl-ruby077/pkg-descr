This gem is a C binding to the excellent YAJL JSON parsing and generation
library.

Features:
 * JSON parsing and encoding directly to and from an IO stream (file, socket,
   etc) or String. Compressed stream parsing and encoding supported for Bzip2,
   Gzip and Deflate.
 * Parse and encode multiple JSON objects to and from streams or strings
   continuously.
 * JSON gem compatibility API - allows yajl-ruby to be used as a drop-in
   replacement for the JSON gem
 * Basic HTTP client (only GET requests supported for now) which parses JSON
   directly off the response body *as it's being received*
 * ~3.5x faster than JSON.generate
 * ~1.9x faster than JSON.parse
 * ~4.5x faster than YAML.load
 * ~377.5x faster than YAML.dump
 * ~1.5x faster than Marshal.load
 * ~2x faster than Marshal.dump
