This is the LIBEPP-NICBR C++ library that partially implements the Extensible
Provisioning Protocol (EPP), as described in the Internet Drafts RFC3730bis to
RFC3734bis and RFC3735.

RFC3731bis - EPP Domain Name Mapping - was implemented with hosts as attributes
of the Domain Object.

In order to conform to the .BR model, extensions to the EPP Domain Name and
Contact Mapping were made (draft-neves-epp-brdomain and draft-neves-epp-brorg),
supported since version 0.2. The documentation for these extensions is
available at EPP References [1].
