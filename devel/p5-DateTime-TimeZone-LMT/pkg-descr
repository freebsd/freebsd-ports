This module provides a 'Local Mean Time' timezone for DateTime. Using it you
can determine the Mean Time for any location on Earth. Note however that the
Mean Time and the Apparent Time (where the sun is in the sky) differ from day
to day. This module may account for Local Apparent Time in the future but then
again, the Solar:: modules will probably be a better bet.

If you want more information on the difference between LMT and LAT, search the
www for 'equation of time' or 'ephemeris'.
