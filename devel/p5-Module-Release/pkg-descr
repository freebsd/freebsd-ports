This program automates Perl module releases.  It makes the distribution,
tests it, checks that CVS is up to date, tags CVS, uploads it to the
PAUSE anonymous FTP directory and to the incoming directory for
SourceForge.net, claims it on PAUSE for your CPAN account, and releases
it on SourceForge.net.
