AutoGen is a tool designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of programs
that contain large amounts of repetitious text. It is especially valuable in
programs that have several blocks of text that must be kept synchronized.

AutoGen will accept either its own definition format, or XML files as definition
input, in addition to CGI data (for producing dynamic HTML) and traditional
AutoGen definitions.

A common example where this would be useful is in creating and maintaining the
code required for processing program options. Processing options requires
multiple constructs to be maintained in parallel in different places in your
program. Options maintenance needs to be done countless times. So, AutoGen comes
with an add-on package named AutoOpts that simplifies the maintenance and
documentation of program options.
