Perl::Metrics::Simple provides just enough methods to run static
analysis of one or many Perl files and obtain a few metrics: packages,
subroutines, lines of code, and an approximation of cyclomatic
(mccabe) complexity for the subroutines and the "main" portion of the
code.

Perl::Metrics::Simple is far simpler than Perl::Metrics.

Installs a script called countperl.
