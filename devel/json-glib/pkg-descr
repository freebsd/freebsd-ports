JSON-GLib is a library providing serialization and deserialization support
for the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format described by RFC 4627. JSON is:

a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write.
It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the
JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.
JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses
conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages,
including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These
properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language. -- From Introducing
JSON

Many high-level languages already provide native modules for parsing, generating
and manipulating JSON data streams. JSON-GLib is a C library based on GLib and
released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1.
It provides a parser and a generator GObject classes and various wrappers for
the complex data types employed by JSON, such as arrays and objects.

JSON-GLib uses GLib native data types and the generic value container GValue
for ease of development. It also provides integration with the GObject classes
for direct serialization into, and deserialization from, JSON data streams.
