A highly-available key value store for shared
configuration and service discovery. etcd is
inspired by zookeeper and doozer, with a focus on:

* Simple: curl'able user facing API (HTTP+JSON)
* Secure: optional SSL client cert authentication
* Fast: benchmarked 1000s of writes/s per instance
* Reliable: Properly distributed using Raft

Etcd is written in Go and uses the raft consensus
algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.
