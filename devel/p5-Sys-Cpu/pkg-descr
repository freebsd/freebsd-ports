Sys::CPU - Perl extension for getting CPU information.
In responce to a post on perlmonks.org, a module for counting 
the number of CPU's on a system. Support has now also been 
added for type of CPU and clock speed. While much of the code 
is from UNIX::Processors, Win32 support has been added 
(but not tested).
