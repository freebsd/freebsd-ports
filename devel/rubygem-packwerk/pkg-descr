Packwerk is a Ruby gem used to enforce boundaries and modularize Rails
applications.

Packwerk can be used to:
- Combine groups of files into packages
- Define package-level constant visibility (i.e. have publicly accessible
  constants)
- Help existing codebases to become more modular without obstructing development
