Mono.Addins is a framework for creating extensible applications, and for
creating libraries which extend those applications.

Mono.Addins has been designed to be easy to use and useful for a wide
range of applications: from simple applications with small extensibility
needs, to complex applications which need support for large add-in
structures.
