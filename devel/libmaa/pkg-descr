The LIBMAA library provides many low-level data structures which are
helpful for writing compilers, including hash tables, sets, lists,
debugging support, and memory management.  Although LIBMAA was
designed and implemented as a foundation for the Khepera
Transformation System, the data structures are generally applicable to
a wide range of programming problems.

The memory management routines are especially helpful for improving the
performance of memory-intensive applications.
