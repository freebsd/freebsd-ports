The previous version of liblognorm (0.3.7) used the libee CEE support
library in its API.

In 2013, Pavel Levshin converted liblognorm to native JSON, which helped
improve performance and simplicity for many client applications.
Unfortunately, this change broke interface compatibility (and there was
no way to avoid that, obviously...).

The current library is the result of that effort. Application developers
are encouraged to switch to this version, as it provides the benefit of
a simpler API. PREVIOUS VERSIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THIS ONE
