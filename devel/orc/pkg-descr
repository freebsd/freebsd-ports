Orc is the successor to Liboil - The Library of Optimized Inner Loops.

Orc is a library and set of tools for compiling and executing very simple
programs that operate on arrays of data. The "language" is a generic assembly
language that represents many of the features available in SIMD architectures,
including saturated addition and subtraction, and many arithmetic operations.
