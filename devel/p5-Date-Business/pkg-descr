Date::Business provides the functionality to perform simple date manipulations
quickly. Support for calendar date and business date math is provided.

Business dates are weekdays only. Adding 1 to a weekend returns Monday,
subtracting 1 returns Friday.

The difference in business days between Friday and the following
Monday (using the diffb function) is one business day. The
number of business days between Friday and the following
Monday (using the betweenb function) is zero.
