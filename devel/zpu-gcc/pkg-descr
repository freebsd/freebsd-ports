zpu-gcc compiler suite for the zpu

Typical usage seems to be experienced engineers who have some very
particular requirements that can only be met using the ZPU due to technical
or licensing issues.

Academic circles have found the ZPU appealing since the actual core is
trivial and allows them to focus on some other aspect of research or
student exercises.
