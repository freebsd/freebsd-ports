billiard is a fork of the Python 2.7 multiprocessing package.  The
multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated version of
R Oudkerk's pyprocessing package. This standalone variant is intended
to be compatible with Python 2.4 and 2.5, and will draw its
fixes/improvements from python-trunk.
