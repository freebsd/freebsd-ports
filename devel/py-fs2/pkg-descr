Filesystem Abstraction for Python. Work with files and directories in archives,
memory, the cloud etc. as easily as your local drive. Write code now, decide
later where the data will be stored; unit test without writing real files;
upload files to the cloud without learning a new API; sandbox your file writing
code; etc.
