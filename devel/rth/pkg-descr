rth is a web-based tool designed to manage requirements, tests,
test results, and defects throughout the application life cycle.
The tool provides a structured approach to software testing and
increases the visibility of the testing process by creating a
common repository for all test assets including requirements,
test cases, test plans, and test results. Regardless of their
geographic location, rth allows testers, developers, business
analysts, and managers to monitor and gauge application
readiness. The tool includes modules for requirements management,
test planning, test execution, defect tracking, and reporting.
