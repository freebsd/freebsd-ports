Test::Class provides a simple way of creating classes and
objects to test your code in an xUnit style.

Built using Test::Builder it is designing to work with
other Test::Builder based modules (Test::More,
Test::Differences, Test::Exception, etc.)

Note: This module will make more sense if you are already
familiar with the "standard" mechanisms for testing perl code.
Those unfamiliar with Test::Harness, Test::Simple, Test::More
and friends should go take a look at them now.

Note: This is an early release. Things may change. Be warned.
