Quickly bundle any Ruby libraries into a RubyGem and share it with the world,
your colleagues, or perhaps just with yourself amongst your projects.

RubyGems are centrally stored, versioned, and support dependencies between 
other gems, so they are the ultimate way to bundle libraries, 
executables, associated tests, examples, and more.

Within this gem, you get one thing - newgem - an executable to create your own 
gems. Your new gems will include designated folders for Ruby code, 
test files, executables, and even a default website page for you to explain 
your project, and which instantly uploads to RubyForge 
website (which looks just like this one by default)
