QtNodes is conceived as a general-purpose Qt-based library aimed at
developing Node Editors for various applications. The library could be
used for simple graph visualization and editing or extended further for
using the Dataflow paradigm.

The library is written using the Model-View approach. The whole graph
structure is defined by a class derived from AbstractGraphModel. It is
possible to create or add Nodes and Connections. The underlying data
structures could be of any arbitrary type or representation.

An instance of AbstractGraphModel could or could not be attached to
specialized QGraphicsScene and QGraphicsView objects. I.e. the so-called
"headless" modus operandi is possible.
