The EnthoughtBase project includes a few core packages that are used by
many other projects in the Enthought Tool Suite:

*enthought.etsconfig: Supports configuring settings that need to be
shared across multiple projects or programs on the same system. Most
significant of these is the GUI toolkit to be used. You can also
configure locations for writing application data and user data, and the
name of the company responsible for the software (which is used in the
application and user data paths on some systems).
*enthought.logger: Provides convenience functions for creating
logging handlers.
*enthought.util: Provides miscellaneous utility functions.
