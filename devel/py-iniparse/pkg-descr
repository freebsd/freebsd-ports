iniparse is a INI parser for Python which is:
    - Compatiable with ConfigParser:
      Backward compatible implementations of ConfigParser,
      RawConfigParser, and SafeConfigParser are included that are
      API-compatible with the Python standard library.
      They pass all the unit tests in Python-2.4.4.

    - Preserves structure of INI files:
      Order of sections & options, indentation, comments, and blank
      lines are preserved as far as possible when data is updated.

    - More convenient:
      Values can be accessed using dotted notation (cfg.user.name),
      or using container syntax (cfg['user']['name']).

It is very useful for config files that are updated both by users and by
programs, since it is very disorienting for a user to have her config
file completely rearranged whenever a program changes it. iniparse also
allows making the order of entries in a config file significant, which is
desirable in applications like image galleries.
