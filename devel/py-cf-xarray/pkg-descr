cf-xarray is a lightweight convenience wrapper for using CF attributes on xarray
objects.

For example you can use .cf.mean("latitude") instead of .mean("lat") if
appropriate attributes are set! This allows you to write code that does not
require knowledge of specific dimension or coordinate names particular to a
dataset.
