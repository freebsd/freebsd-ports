Pytest plugin to drop duplicated tests during collection. Pytest by default
will collect all tests from directories or files given configured by the
Project, or passed on the command line. The plugin aims to reduce test work by
executing tests/unit first, followed by the remaining tests under tests,
however, without duplicates.
