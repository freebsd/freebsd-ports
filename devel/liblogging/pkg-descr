Liblogging offers an enhanced replacement for the syslog() call, but
retains its ease of use. In a nutshell, it permits sytem administrators
to direct application log output to different destinations without
requiring the app developer to do any work for this. Liblogging is
released under a 2-clause BSD license and as such can be used in any
application.
