Tools to ease creating larger test libraries for Robot Framework using Python.
The Robot Framework hybrid and dynamic library API gives more flexibility for
library than the static library API, but they also sets requirements for
libraries which needs to be implemented in the library side. PythonLibCore eases
the problem by providing simpler interface and handling all the requirements
towards the Robot Framework library APIs.
