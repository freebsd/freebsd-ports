Time::Duration::Parse is a module to parse human readable duration
strings like 2 minutes and 3 seconds to seconds.

It does the opposite of duration_exact function in Time::Duration and
is roundtrip safe. So, the following is always true.

  use Time::Duration::Parse;
  use Time::Duration;

  my $seconds = int rand 100000;
  is( parse_duration(duration_exact($seconds)), $seconds );
