JQuery is a frontend for the jQuery language. I use JQuery to refer to the Perl
part or the package, and jQuery to reference the javascript part or the package.

A quote from http://jquery.com: jQuery is a fast, concise, JavaScript Library
that simplifies how you traverse HTML documents, handle events, perform
animations, and add Ajax interactions to your web pages.
