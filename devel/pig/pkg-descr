Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a
high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with
infrastructure for evaluating these programs.  The salient property of Pig
programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization,
which in turns enables them to handle very large data sets.

At the present time, Pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that
produces sequences of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel
implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop subproject).  Pig's language
layer currently consists of a textual language called Pig Latin, which has
the following key properties:

-- Ease of programming.  It is trivial to achieve parallel execution of simple,
"embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks.  Complex tasks comprised of
multiple interrelated data transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow
sequences, making them easy to write, understand, and maintain.
-- Optimization opportunities.  The way in which tasks are encoded permits the
system to optimize their execution automatically, allowing the user to focus
on semantics rather than efficiency.
-- Extensibility.  Users can create their own functions to do special-purpose
processing.
