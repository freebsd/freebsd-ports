LMDBG is a collection of small tools for collecting and analyzing
the logs of malloc/realloc/memalign/free function calls. Unlike many
others, LMDBG does not provide any way to detect overruns of the
boundaries of malloc() memory allocations, as this is not the goal.
Like most other malloc debuggers, LMDBG allows detecting memory leaks
and double frees. However, unlike others, LMDBG generates full
stacktraces and separates the logging process from analysis, thus
allowing you to analyze an application on a per-module basis.
