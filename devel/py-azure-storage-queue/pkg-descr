Azure Queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages that can
be accessed from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or
HTTPS. A single queue message can be up to 64 KiB in size, and a queue can
contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage
account.

Common uses of Queue storage include:
- Creating a backlog of work to process asynchronously
- Passing messages between different parts of a distributed application
