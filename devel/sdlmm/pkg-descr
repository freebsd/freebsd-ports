SDLmm is a C++ glue for SDL, or the Simple DirectMedia Layer, which is a
generic API that provides low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse,
joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D framebuffer across multiple
platforms.

SDLmm aims to stay as close as possible to the C API while taking advantage
of native C++ features like object orientation. We will also aim at being
platform independent as much as possible.
