A collection of various methods for splitting lists into parts, akin to
the "split" function found in several mainstream languages.  Here is its
tale:

Once upon a time the standard Data.List module held no function for
splitting a list into parts according to a delimiter.  Many a brave
lambda-knight strove to add such a function, but their striving was in
vain, for Lo, the Supreme Council fell to bickering amongst themselves
what was to be the essential nature of the One True Function which could
cleave a list in twain (or thrain, or any required number of parts).

And thus came to pass the split package, comprising divers functions for
splitting a list asunder, each according to its nature.  And the Supreme
Council had no longer any grounds for argument, for the favored method
of each was contained therein.
