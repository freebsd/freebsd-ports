Moo is an extremely light-weight Object Orientation system. It allows
one to concisely define objects and roles with a convenient syntax that
avoids the details of Perl's object system. Moo contains a subset of
Moose and is optimised for rapid startup.

The name Moo is based on the idea that it provides almost -- but not
quite -- two thirds of Moose.

Unlike Mouse this module does not aim at full compatibility with
Moose's surface syntax, preferring instead to provide full
interoperability via metaclass inflation capabilities.
