aiofiles is an Apache2 licensed library, written in Python, for handling local
disk files in asyncio applications.

Ordinary local file IO is blocking, and cannot easily and portably made
asynchronous. This means doing file IO may interfere with asyncio applications,
which shouldn't block the executing thread. aiofiles helps with this by
introducing asynchronous versions of files that support delegating operations to
a separate thread pool.

Features:
- a file API very similar to Python's standard, blocking API
- support for buffered and unbuffered binary files, and buffered text files
- support for async/await (PEP 492) constructs
