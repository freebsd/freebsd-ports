This module adds lightweight hooks into the inner workings of POE.
Currently, one can add hooks into POE that get called before/after an
event is dispatched and/or before/after a Session is created.  These
callbacks receive the exact same argument list as their Kernel/Session
counterpart.  For event dispatch related callbacks, see _dispatch_event
in POE::Kernel.  For session related callbacks, see create in
POE::Session.
