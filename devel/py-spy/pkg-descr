py-spy is a sampling profiler for Python programs. It lets you visualize what
your Python program is spending time on without restarting the program or
modifying the code in any way.

py-spy is extremely low overhead: it is written in Rust for speed and doesn't
run in the same process as the profiled Python program.

This means py-spy is safe to use against production Python code.
