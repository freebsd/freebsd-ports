Boost.Build is an easy way to build C++ projects, everywhere. You
name you executables and libraries and list their sources.

Boost.Build takes care about compiling your sources with right
options, creating static and shared libraries, making executables,
and other chores -- whether you're using gcc, msvc, or a dozen
more supported C++ compilers -- on Windows, OSX, Linux and
commercial UNIX systems.
