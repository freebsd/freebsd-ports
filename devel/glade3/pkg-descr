Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces
for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. The user interfaces
designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using the GtkBuilder GTK+ object
these can be loaded by applications dynamically as needed.

This version of Glade targets Gtk+ 2.
