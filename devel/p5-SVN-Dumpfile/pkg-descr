SVN::Dumpfile represents a Subversion dumpfile. It provides methods
to read existing and write modified or new dumpfiles. It supports
dumpfiles with the version number 1 - 3 but was written in a tolerant
way to also support newer versions as long no major changes are
made.

This module is a OO redesign and generalisation of SVN::Dumpfilter
v0.21. Newer versions of SVN::Dumpfilter are using it to access the
input and output dumpfiles.

The ability to create new dumpfiles sets it apart from the similar
module SVN::Dump. The submodule SVN::Dumpfile::Node::Properties
also allows the processing of Subversion revision property files
(i.e. the files lying in the $REPOSITORY/db/revprops/ directory
holding the author, date and log entry of every revision).
