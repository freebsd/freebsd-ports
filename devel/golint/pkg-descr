A linter for Go source code.

Invoke golint with one or more filenames, directories, or packages named by its
import path. Golint uses the same import path syntax as the go command and
therefore also supports relative import paths like ./.... Additionally the ...
wildcard can be used as suffix on relative and absolute file paths to recurse
into them.

The output of this tool is a list of suggestions in Vim quickfix format, which
is accepted by lots of different editors.
