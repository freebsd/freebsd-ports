A lot of Perl code ends up with scalars having either a single scalar value
or a reference to an array of scalar values. In order to handle the two
conditions, one must check for what is in the scalar value before getting on
with one's task. Ie:

  $text_scalar = 'text';
  $aref_scalar = [ 1.. 5 ];

  print ref($text_scalar) ? (join ':', @$text_scalar) : $text_scalar;

And this module is designed to address just that!
