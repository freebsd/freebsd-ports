Exporter::Tiny supports many of Sub::Exporter's external-facing features
including renaming imported functions with the -as, -prefix and -suffix options;
explicit destinations with the into option; and alternative installers with the
installler option. But it's written in only about 40% as many lines of code and
with zero non-core dependencies.

Its internal-facing interface is closer to Exporter.pm, with configuration done
through the @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS package variables.

Exporter::Tiny performs most of its internal duties (including resolution of tag
names to sub names, resolution of sub names to coderefs, and installation of
coderefs into the target package) as method calls, which means they can be
overridden to provide interesting behaviour.
