"SilentBob" is a tool to help a programmer/team manager to digest
and comprehend either a simple program or a big source code tree
based on the source code by presenting the code in a searcheable
and tagged way.

It helps to speed up the learning curve and to make it more convenient
to get hands on a code from somebody, or also is convenient to
browse your own projects.

It includes functionality from such tools as: ctags, cscope and
ctree, but it is faster than any of them, and is offering the
features in one package.

In some way it can be viewed as a superset of ctags, cscope and
ctree.
