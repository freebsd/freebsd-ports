This module understands the formats used by PostgreSQL for its DATE, TIME,
TIMESTAMP, and INTERVAL data types. It can be used to parse these formats in
order to create DateTime or DateTime::Duration objects, and it can take a
DateTime or DateTime::Duration object and produce a string representing it in a
format accepted by PostgreSQL.
