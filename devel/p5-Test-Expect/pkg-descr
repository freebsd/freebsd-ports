Test::Expect is a module for automated driving and testing of 
terminal-based programs. It is handy for testing interactive programs 
which have a prompt, and is based on the same concepts as the Tcl Expect 
tool. As in Expect::Simple, the Expect object is made available for 
tweaking.

Test::Expect is intended for use in a test script.
