Many libraries in compiled languages such as C or C++ provide ".pc" files to
specify the flags required for compiling and linking against those libraries.
Traditionally, the command line program "pkg-config" is used to query these
files. PkgConfig::LibPkgConf provides a Perl level API using "libpkgconf" to
these files.

PkgConfig::LibPkgConf provides a simplified interface for getting the existence,
version, cflags and library flags needed for compiling against a package, using
the default compiled in configuration of "pkgconf". For a more powerful, but
complicated interface see PkgConfig::LibPkgConf::Client. In addition,
PkgConfig::LibPkgConf::Util provides some useful utility functions that are also
provided by "pkgconf".
