IO::Multiplex is designed to take the effort out of managing multiple
file handles.  It is essentially a really fancy front end to the select
system call.  In addition to maintaining the select loop, it buffers all
input and output to/from the file handles.  It can also accept incoming
connections on one or more listen sockets.
