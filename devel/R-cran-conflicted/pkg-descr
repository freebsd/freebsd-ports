R's default conflict management system gives the most recently loaded package
precedence. This can make it hard to detect conflicts, particularly when they
arise because a package update creates ambiguity that did not previously exist.
'conflicted' takes a different approach, making every conflict an error and
forcing you to choose which function to use.
