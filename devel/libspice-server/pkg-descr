The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is
a remote display system built for virtual environments which allows
you to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on the machine
where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide
variety of machine architectures.

This package contains the run-time libraries for any application that
wishes to be a SPICE server
