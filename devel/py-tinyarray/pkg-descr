Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for small
sizes. Common operations on very small arrays are to 3-7 times
faster than with NumPy (with NumPy 1.6 it used to be up to 35
times), and 3 times less memory is used to store them. Tinyarrays
are useful if you need many small arrays of numbers, and cannot
combine them into a few large ones. (The resulting code is still
much slower than C, but it may now be fast enough.)
