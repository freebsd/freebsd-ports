If you need nonblocking access to an external program, or want to execute some
blocking code in a separate process, but you don't want to write a wrapper
module or some POE::Wheel::Run boilerplate code, then POE::Quickie can help.

You just specify what you're interested in (stdout, stderr, and/or exit code),
and POE::Quickie will handle the rest in a sensible way.

It has some convenience features, such as killing processes after a timeout,
and storing process-specific context information which will be delivered with
every event.

There is also an even lazier API which suspends the execution of your event
handler and gives control back to POE while your task is running, the same
way LWP::UserAgent::POE does.

This is provided by the quickie_* functions which are exported by default.
