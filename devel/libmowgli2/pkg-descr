mowgli is a development framework for C (like GLib), which provides high
performance and highly flexible algorithms. It can be used as a supplement
to GLib (to add additional functions (dictionaries, hashes), or replace
some of the slow GLib list manipulation functions), or stand alone. It
also provides a powerful hook system and convenient logging for your code,
as well as a high performance block allocator.
