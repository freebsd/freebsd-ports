AUnit is a set of Ada packages based on the xUnit family of unit test
frameworks. It's intended as a developer's tool to facilitate
confident writing and evolution of Ada software. It is purposely
lightweight, as one of its main goals is to make it easy to develop
and run unit tests, rather than to generate artifacts for process
management. The framework supports easy composition of sets of unit
tests to provide flexibility in determining what tests to run for a
given purpose.
