The Linux kernel.

This port is a building block for creating custom Linux appliances in
FreeBSD as part of your regular package build without a Linux VM or
jail.

Provide your own Linux kernel configuration file via the LINUX_KCONFIG
make variable, or create your own via support of Linux' config tools.

The default configuration comes with QEMU/KVM guest support.
