RRDTool::OO is an object-oriented interface to Tobi Oetiker's round robin
database tool rrdtool. It uses rrdtool's RRDs module to get access to rrdtool's
shared library.

RRDTool::OO tries to marry rrdtool's database engine with the dwimminess and
whipuptitude Perl programmers take for granted. Using RRDTool::OO abstracts
away implementation details of the RRD engine, uses easy to memorize named
parameters and sets meaningful defaults for parameters not needed in simple
cases.
