Elib, the GNU Emacs Lisp Library, is a collection of useful routines
for Emacs lisp programs which don't have to be reinvented each time
a new program is written.

Elib provides features of:
   - container data structures (queues, stacks, AVL trees, etc)
   - string handling functions missing in standard Emacs
   - minibuffer handling functions missing in standard Emacs
   - routines for handling lists of so-called cookies in a buffer.
