Epydoc is a tool for generating API documentation for Python modules, based on
their docstrings. For an example of epydoc's output, see the API documentation
for epydoc itself. A lightweight markup language called epytext can be used to
format docstrings, and to add information about specific fields, such as
parameters and instance variables. Epydoc also understands docstrings written in
ReStructuredText, Javadoc and plaintext.
