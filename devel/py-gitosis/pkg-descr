Manage git repositories, provide access to them over SSH, with tight
access control and not needing shell accounts.

Gitosis aims to make hosting git repos easier and safer. It manages
multiple repositories under one user account, using SSH keys to
identify users. End users do not need shell accounts on the server,
they will talk to one shared account that will not let them run
arbitrary commands.
