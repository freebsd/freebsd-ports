File::Flat implements a flat filesystem.  A flat filesystem is a
filesystem in which directories do not exist.  It provides an
abstraction over any normal filesystem which makes it appear as if
directories do not exist.  In effect, it will automatically create
directories as needed.  This is create for things like install scripts
and such, as you never need to worry about the existance of directories,
just write to a file, no matter where it is.
