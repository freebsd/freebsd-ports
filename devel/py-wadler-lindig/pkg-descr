wadler-lindig provides a "pretty-printer" for Python objects, based on
the Wadler-Lindig layout algorithm. It is an alternative to the built-in
`pprint` module that consumes less horizontal space, which is useful
for displaying complex, nested data structures in error messages or
interactive sessions.

The implementation is small, has no dependencies, and supports custom
pretty-printed representations for user-defined types.
