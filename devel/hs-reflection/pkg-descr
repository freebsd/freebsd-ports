This package addresses the configuration problem which is propogating
configurations that are available at run-time, allowing multible
configurations to coexist without resorting to mutable global variables
or System.IO.Unsafe.unsafePerformIO.

That package is an implementation of the ideas presented in the paper
"Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations" by Oleg Kiselyov and
Chung-chieh Shan (original paper).  However, the API has been
streamlined to improve performance.
