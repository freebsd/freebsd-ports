Colored terminal output on terminals that support 'ANSI' color and 
highlight codes. It also works in 'Emacs' 'ESS'. 'ANSI' color support is 
automatically detected. Colors and highlighting can be combined and 
nested. New styles can also be created easily. This package was inspired 
by the 'chalk' 'JavaScript' project.
