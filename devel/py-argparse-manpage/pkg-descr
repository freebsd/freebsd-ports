Avoid documenting your Python script arguments on two places! This is typically
done in an argparse.ArgumentParser help configuration (help=, description=,
etc.), and also in a manually crafted manual page.

The good thing about an ArgumentParser objects is that it actually provides a
traversable "tree-like" structure, with all the necessary info needed to
automatically generate documentation, for example in a groff typesetting system
(manual pages). And this is where this project can help.

There are two supported ways to generate the manual, either script it using the
installed command argparse-manpage, or via setup.py build automation (with a
slight bonus of automatic manual page installation with setup.py install).
