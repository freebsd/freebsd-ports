Reflex - A class library for flexible, reactive programs.

Reflex is a library of classes that assist with writing reactive (AKA
event-driven) programs. Reflex uses Moose internally, but it doesn't enforce
programs to use Moose's syntax. However, Moose syntax brings several useful
features we hope will become indispensible.
