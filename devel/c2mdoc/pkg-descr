c2mdoc is a shell and awk script wrapper which abuses devel/cproto's parser
to spit out function prototypes in a format ready to paste into FreeBSD
developer documentation. c2man already claims to do such a thing, but seems
crippled in the face of our kernel source. The toolchain used by this port
whinges but still generates markup.
