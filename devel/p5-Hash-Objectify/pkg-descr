Hash::Objectify turns a hash reference into a simple object with accessors for
each of the keys.

One application of this module could be to create lightweight response objects
without the extra work of setting up an entire response class with the framework
of your choice.

Using Hash::Objectify is slower than accessing the keys of the hash directly,
but does provide "typo protection" since a misspelled method is an error.
