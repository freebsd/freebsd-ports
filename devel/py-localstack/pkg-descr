LocalStack is a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container on your
laptop or in your CI environment. With LocalStack, you can run your AWS
applications or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a
remote cloud provider! Whether you are testing complex CDK applications or
Terraform configurations, or just beginning to learn about AWS services,
LocalStack helps speed up and simplify your testing and development workflow.

LocalStack supports a growing number of AWS services, like AWS Lambda, S3,
DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, SNS, and many more! The Pro version of LocalStack
supports additional APIs and advanced features. You can find a comprehensive
list of supported APIs on our Feature Coverage page.

LocalStack also provides additional features to make your life as a cloud
developer easier! Check out LocalStack's User Guides for more information.
