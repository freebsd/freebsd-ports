Cymbal makes it easy to add functionality missing from libclang Python
bindings

The Clang libclang python bindings use ctypes to invoke functions
present in libclang dynamic library. In some cases, only a subset of
the C functions are available, because the platform or version
specific Python bindings omit functions. Cymbal simplfies the process
of dynamically adding those methods to Types and Cursors.
