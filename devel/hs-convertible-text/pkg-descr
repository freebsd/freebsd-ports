This is a port of John Goerzen's convertible package, intended to
distinguish between conversions which are guaranteed to succeed and
those which might fail.  It uses the attempt package, which in turn uses
the failure package, so that this package is fully compatible with the
failure framework.

This package currently contains all of the typeclasses and instances for
convertible.  However, as these features are ported to the convertible
package, this package will be left with only the instances for
converting to and from text types (String, ByteString (lazy and strict)
and Text (lazy and strict).

Be aware that conversions to and from bytestrings assume UTF-8 encoding.
If a different encoding is desired, you can use a newtype wrapper and
declare an instance of ConvertAttempt or ConvertSuccess on it.
