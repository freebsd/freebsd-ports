R.cache: Fast and Light-Weight Caching (Memoization) of Objects and Results to
Speed Up Computations

Memoization can be used to speed up repetitive and computational expensive
function calls. The first time a function that implements memoization is called
the results are stored in a cache memory. The next time the function is called
with the same set of parameters, the results are momentarily retrieved from the
cache avoiding repeating the calculations. With this package, any R object can
be cached in a key-value storage where the key can be an arbitrary set of R
objects. The cache memory is persistent (on the file system).
