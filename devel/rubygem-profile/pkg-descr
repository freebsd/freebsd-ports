Profile provides a way to Profile your Ruby application.

Profiling your program is a way of determining which methods are called and how
long each method takes to complete. This way you can detect which methods are
possible bottlenecks.

Profiling your program will slow down your execution time considerably, so
activate it only when you need it. Don't confuse benchmarking with profiling.
