iniconfig is a small and simple INI-file parser module having a unique set of
features:

* maintains order of sections and entries
* supports multi-line values with or without line-continuations
* supports "#" comments everywhere
* raises errors with proper line-numbers
* no bells and whistles like automatic substitutions
* iniconfig raises an Error if two sections have the same name.
