More Opcodes information from opnames.h and opcode.h

The canonical list of operator names is the contents of the array
PL_op_name, defined and initialised in file opcode.h of the Perl
source distribution (and installed into the perl library).

Each operator has both a terse name (its opname) and a more verbose or
recognisable descriptive name. The opdesc function can be used to
return a description for an OP.
