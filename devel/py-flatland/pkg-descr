Flatland maps between rich, structured Python application data and the
string-oriented flat namespace of web forms, key/value stores, text
files and user input.  Flatland provides a schema-driven mapping toolkit
with optional data validation.

Flatland is great for:
- Collecting, validating, re-displaying and processing HTML form data
- Dealing with rich structures (lists, dicts, lists of dicts, etc.) in
  web data
- Validating JSON, YAML, and other structured formats
- Associating arbitrary Python types with JSON, .ini, or sys.argv
  members that would otherwise deserialize as simple strings.
- Reusing a single data schema for HTML, JSON apis, RPC

The core of the flatland toolkit is a flexible and extensible
declarative schema system representing many data types and structures.

A validation system and library of schema-aware validators is also
provided, with rich i18n capabilities for use in HTML, network APIs and
other environments where user-facing messaging is required.
