Standalone library to control various widely available Freescale's mpc8xx
based boards. This code was derived from mpcbdm patch by Frank Przybylski.

This allows using this code separately from gdb, for example, to load
firmware to the board, or retrieve information about it.

The package includes example "mpc8xx" program, that displays information
about connected board using libmpcbdm library.

The schematic of adapter itself can be found at project homepage.
