This is a POSIX binding for LuaJIT, Lua 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3; like most libraries it
simply binds to C APIs on the underlying system, so it won't work on non-POSIX
systems. However, it does try to detect the level of POSIX conformance of the
underlying system and bind only available APIs.

For a while, luaposix contained support for curses functionality too, but now it
has its own lcurses repository again, where it is being maintained separately.
