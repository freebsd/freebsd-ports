From the README:-

This program provides a driver validation sequence for validating drivers
on Unix OS's and PC/SC Lite.

To use this tester you must have a set of PC/SC test suite cards.  This
test is nearly identical to that which is done by Microsoft's WHQL Group
and can be used to verify the quality of your driver for use with
pcsc-lite.  For those familiar with IFDTEST.EXE this will be no different.
