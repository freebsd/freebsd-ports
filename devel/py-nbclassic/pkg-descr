NBClassic runs the Jupyter Notebook frontend on the Jupyter Server backend.

This project prepares for a future where JupyterLab and other frontends switch
to Jupyter Server for their Python Web application backend. Using this package,
users can launch Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab and other frontends side-by-side
on top of the new Python server backend.
