StringZilla is the GodZilla of string libraries, using SIMD and SWAR to
accelerate string operations on modern CPUs. It is up to 10x faster than the
default and even other SIMD-accelerated string libraries in C, C++, Python,
and other languages, while covering broad functionality. It accelerates exact
and fuzzy string matching, edit distance computations, sorting,
lazily-evaluated ranges to avoid memory allocations, and even random-string
generators.
