Argparse takes the best of the optparse command-line parsing module and brings
it new life. Argparse adds positional as well as optional arguments, the
ability to create parsers for sub-commands, more informative help and usage
messages, and much more. At the same time, it retains the ease and flexibility
of use that made optparse so popular.
