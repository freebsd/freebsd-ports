Provides fundamental abstractions for doing asynchronous programming
in R using promises. Asynchronous programming is useful for allowing
a single R process to orchestrate multiple tasks in the background
while also attending to something else. Semantics are similar to
'JavaScript' promises, but with a syntax that is idiomatic R.
