Syntax::Keyword::Match provides a syntax plugin that implements a control-flow
block called match/case, which executes at most one of a choice of different
blocks depending on the value of its controlling expression.

This is similar to C's switch/case syntax (copied into many other languages), or
syntax provided by Switch::Plain.
