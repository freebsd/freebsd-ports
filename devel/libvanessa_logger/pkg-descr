libvanessa_logger provides a generic logging layer that may be used to log
to one or more of syslog, an open file handle or a file name. Though due to
limitations in the implementation of syslog opening multiple syslog loggers
doesn't makes sense. Includes the ability to limit which messages will be
logged based on priorities.
