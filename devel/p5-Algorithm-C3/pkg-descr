This module implements the C3 algorithm. I have broken this out
into it's own module because I found myself copying and pasting
it way too often for various needs. Most of the uses I have for
C3 revolve around class building and metamodels, but it could
also be used for things like dependency resolution as well since
it tends to do such a nice job of preserving local precedence
orderings.
