Arduino seven segment display library

This library turns your Arduino into a seven segment display
controller! Use it to easily display numbers on your seven segment
display without any additional controllers.

It supports common cathode and common anode displays, and the use
of switching transistors. Displays with 1 to 9 digits can be used,
and decimal places are supported. Characters and strings are not
supported.
