Expect::Simple is a wrapper around the Expect module which should suffice
for simple applications. It hides most of the Expect machinery; the Expect
object is available for tweaking if need be.

Generally, one starts by creating an Expect::Simple object using new. This
will start up the target program, and will wait until one of the specified
prompts is output by the target. At that point the caller should send()
commands to the program; the results are available via the before, after,
match_str, and match_idx methods. Since Expect simulates a terminal, there
will be extra \r characters at the end of each line in the result (on UNIX
at least). This is easily fixed:

    ($res = $obj->before) =~ tr/\r//d;
    @lines = split( "\n", $res );

This is not done automatically.

Exceptions will be thrown on error (match with /Expect::Simple/). Errors
from Expect are available via the error_expect method. More human readable
errors are available via the error method.

The connection is automatically broken (by sending the specified
disconnect command to the target) when the Expect::Simple object is
destroyed.
