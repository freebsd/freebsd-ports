The C++ Portable Components currently consist of four libraries.

The Foundation library contains a platform abstraction layer
(including classes for multithreading, file system access, logging,
etc.), as well as a large number of useful utility classes, such
various stream buffer and stream classes, URI handling, and many
more.  The remaining libraries include:

 o Crypto - Encrypt/decrypt data or I/O streams
 o Data - database access ODBC, SQLite, MySQL client
 o Net - network classes (sockets, HTTP, etc.)
 o NetSSL - SSL/TLS protocol sockets based on OpenSSL
 o PageCompiler - C++ Server Page Compiler, for dynamic HTML in C++ apps
 o XML - parser with SAX2 and DOM interfaces and an XMLWriter
 o Util - config files and command line arguments, various utility classes
 o Zip classes for (de)compressing data or I/O streams

This is now known as the '-all' distribution by the Poco project,
but the FreeBSD port remains named -ssl for hysterical raisins.
