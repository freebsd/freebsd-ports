SVN-Look is a caching wrapper aroung the svnlook command.

The svnlook command is the workhorse of Subversion hook scripts,
being used to gather all sorts of information about a repository,
its revisions, and its transactions.

This script provides a simple object oriented interface to a specific
svnlook invocation, to make it easier to hook writers to get and
use the information they need.  Moreover, all the information
gathered buy calling the svnlook command is cached in the object,
avoiding repetitious calls.
