XCAP protocol, defined in RFC 4825, allows a client to read, write, and
modify application configuration data stored in XML format on a server. XCAP
maps XML document sub-trees and element attributes to HTTP URIs, so that
these components can be directly accessed by HTTP. An XCAP server used by
XCAP clients to store data like presence policy in combination with a SIP
Presence server that supports PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY SIP methods can
provide a complete SIP SIMPLE solution.
