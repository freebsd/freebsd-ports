Foolscap is an RPC/RMI (Remote Procedure Call / Remote Method Invocation)
protocol for use with Twisted, derived/inspired by Twisted's built-in
"Perspective Broker" package.

If you have control of both ends of the wire, and are thus not constrained to
use some other protocol like HTTP/XMLRPC/CORBA/etc, you might consider using
Foolscap.

Fundamentally, Foolscap allows you to make a python object in one process
available to code in other processes, which means you can invoke its methods
remotely. This includes a data serialization layer to convey the object graphs
for the arguments and the eventual response, and an object reference system to
keep track of which objects you are connecting to. It uses a capability-based
security model, such that once you create a non-public object, it is only
accessible to clients to whom you've given the (unguessable) FURL. You can of
course publish world-visible objects that have well-known FURLs.
