Gearman provides a generic application framework to farm out work to other
machines or processes that are better suited to do the work. It allows you to do
work in parallel, to load balance processing, and to call functions between
languages. It can be used in a variety of applications, from high-availability
web sites to the transport of database replication events. In other words, it is
the nervous system for how distributed processing communicates.

This package provides an interface for PHP to communicate with the Gearman
server.
