Perl6::Form - Implements the Perl 6 'form' built-in

This module implements virtually all of the functionality of the 
Perl 6 Form.pm module. The only differences are:

    Option pairs must be passed in a hash reference; 
    Array data sources must be passed as array references; 
    Options specified on the use Perl6::Form line are not (yet) 
lexically scoped; 
    User-defined line-breaking subroutines are passed their data 
source as a reference to a scalar;
