The binary I/O stream class library presents a platform-independent way to
access binary data streams in C++.

The library is hardware independent in the form that it transparently
converts between the different forms of machine-internal binary data
representation.

It further employs no special I/O protocol and can be used on arbitrary
binary data sources.
