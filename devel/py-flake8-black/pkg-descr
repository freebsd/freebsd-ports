flake8-black is an MIT licensed flake8 plugin for validating Python code style
with the command line code formatting tool black.

Black, "The Uncompromising Code Formatter", is normally run to edit your Python
code in place to match their coding style, a strict subset of the PEP 8 style
guide.

The point of this plugin is to be able to run black --check ... from within the
flake8 plugin ecosystem. You might use this via a git pre-commit hook, or as
part of your continuous integration testing.
