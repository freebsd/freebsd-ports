See ../sfslite/pkg-descr.  A build of the sfslite libraries with
without -O or -O2 build flags. Useful for finding bugs that show up
after your application has been running for a while.  SFS is about 50%
slower without -O2, but sometimes optimized code makes for baffling
core dumps.  This build of OKWS might be a reasonable compromise between
performance (sfslite) and debugability (sfslite-dbg).

Maintained as port of the OKWS distribution by Maxwell Krohn.
