Lap is a linear assignment problem solver using Jonker-Volgenant algorithm
for dense LAPJV or sparse LAPMOD matrices. Both algorithms are implemented
from scratch based solely on the papers and the public domain Pascal
implementation provided by A. Volgenant. The LAPMOD implementation seems to
be faster than the LAPJV implementation for matrices with a side of more
than ~5000 and with less than 50% finite coefficients.
