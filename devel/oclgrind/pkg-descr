Oclgrind

SPIR interpreter and virtual OpenCL device simulator

Oclgrind implements a virtual OpenCL device simulator, including an OpenCL 
runtime with ICD support. The goal is to provide a platform for creating tools 
to aid OpenCL development. In particular, this project currently implements 
utilities for debugging memory access errors, detecting data-races and barrier 
divergence, collecting instruction histograms, and for interactive OpenCL 
kernel debugging. The simulator is built on an interpreter for LLVM IR.
