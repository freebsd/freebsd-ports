This program generates a graph (in PNG format) showing the revisions,
tags, and branching of a file in a CVS or RCS repository.  Example:

cvsgraph -r /home/ncvs -m ports/devel/cvsgraph -o test.png pkg-descr,v

It can also be used with cvsweb.  A patch to cvsweb is available
through the cvsgraph home page.
