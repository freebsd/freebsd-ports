There are two modules in this distribution. Date::Doomsday calculates
doomsday for a particular year. Date::DayOfWeek uses the doomsday
algorithm to calculate the day of the week for any given date.

Doomsday is a cute little idea invented by Dr John Conway that makes it
very easy to figure out the day of the week for any date.
