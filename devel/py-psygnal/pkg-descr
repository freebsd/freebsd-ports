Psygnal (pronounced "signal") is a pure python implementation of the observer
pattern, with the API of Qt-style Signals with (optional) signature and type
checking, and support for threading. It has no dependencies.

This library does not require or use Qt in any way, It simply implements a
similar observer pattern API.
