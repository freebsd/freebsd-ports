The ncurses software includes a SVr4 and XSI-Curses compatible
curses library as well as terminfo tools including "tic", "infocmp",
and "captoinfo".  The library is used by other programs for text-mode
support of color, multiple highlights, forms-drawing characters,
automatic recognition of keypad and function-key sequences, and
more.

The ncurses library uses a terminfo database (included), but can
be configured to use BSD's /etc/termcap file instead.  This has
been approved by the old 4.4BSD curses maintainer as the official
4.4BSD curses successor.
