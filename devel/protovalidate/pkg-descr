Protovalidate is the semantic validation library for Protobuf. It provides
standard annotations to validate common rules on messages and fields, as well as
the ability to use CEL to write custom rules. It's the next generation of
protoc-gen-validate.

With Protovalidate, you can annotate your Protobuf messages with both standard
and custom validation rules.
