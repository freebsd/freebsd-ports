This package provides a set of helper programs necessary to build the Gtk2Hs
suite of libraries.  These tools include a modified c2hs binding tool that
is used to generated FFI declarations, a tool to build a type hiearchy that
mirrors the C type hiearchy of GObjects found in glib, and a generator for
signal declarations that are used to call back from C to Haskell.  These tools
are not needed to actually run Gtk2Hs programs.
