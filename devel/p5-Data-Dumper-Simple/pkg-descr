This module allow the user to dump variables in a Data::Dumper format.

Unlike the default behavior of Data::Dumper, the variables are named
(instead of $VAR1, $VAR2, etc.)  Data::Dumper provides an extended
interface that allows the programmer to name the variables, but this
interface requires a lot of typing and is prone to tyops (sic).  This
module fixes that.

Data::Dumper::Simple is actually a source filter that replaces all
instances of Dumper($some, @args) in your code with a call to
Data::Dumper->Dump(). You can use the one function provided to make
dumping variables for debugging a trivial task.

Note that this is primarily a debugging tool. Data::Dumper offers a
bit more than that, so don't expect this module to be more than it is.
