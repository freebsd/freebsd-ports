UI::Dialog is a OOPerl wrapper for the various dialog applications. These
dialog backends are currently supported: Zenity, XDialog, GDialog, KDialog,
CDialog, and Whiptail. There is also an ASCII backend provided as a last resort
interface for the console based dialog variants. UI::Dialog is a class that
provides a strict interface to these various backend modules. By using
UI::Dialog (with it's imposed limitations on the widgets) you can ensure that
your Perl program will function with any available interfaces.
