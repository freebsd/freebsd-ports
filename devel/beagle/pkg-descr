Open BEAGLE is a C++ Evolutionary Computation (EC) framework. It provides an
high-level software environment to do any kind of EC, with support for
tree-based genetic programming, bit string and real-valued genetic algorithms,
and evolution strategy.

The Open BEAGLE architecture follows strong principles of object oriented
programming, where abstractions are represented by loosely coupled objects and
where it is common and easy to reuse code. Open BEAGLE is designed to provide
an EC environment that is generic, user friendly, portable, efficient, robust,
elegant and free.
