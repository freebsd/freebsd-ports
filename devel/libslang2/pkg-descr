S-Lang is a multi-platform programmer's library designed to
allow a developer to create robust multi-platform software.

It provides facilities required by interactive applications
such as display/screen management, keyboard input, keymaps,
and so on.

The most exciting feature of the library is the slang
interpreter that may be easily embedded into a program to
make it extensible.
