The Ada 95 Booch components are a port of Grady Booch's C++ components.
They contain the same key abstractions as the C++ form (Structs, Tools and
Support). However, the organization is slightly different, particularly in
the Support domain. This is because Ada 95 provides several special forms
of memory management that are quite different from C++.

The Structs category provides an array of structural abstractions (Bags,
Collections, Deques, Graphs, Lists, Maps, Queues, Rings, Sets, Stacks, and
Trees). The Tools category provides algorithmic abstractions (Searching,
Sorting, etc.). The Support category contains all the "concrete" forms,
plus structures to create the components.

Some of the structures permit structural sharing (graphs, lists, and trees).
Some structures may also be ordered (collections, dequeues, and queues). There
are also multiple forms for some structures: single and double linked lists,
directed and undirected graphs, and binary, multiway, and AVL trees.
