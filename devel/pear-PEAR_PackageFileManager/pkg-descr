PEAR::PEAR_PackageFileManager revolutionizes the maintenance of PEAR packages.

With a few parameters, the entire package.xml is automatically updated with a
listing of all files in a package.

Features include
  - can detect PHP and extension dependencies using PHP_CompatInfo
  - reads in an existing package.xml file, and only changes the
    release/changelog
  - a plugin system for retrieving files in a directory. Currently two plugins
    exist, one for standard recursive directory content listing, and one that
    reads the CVS/Entries files and generates a file listing based on the
    contents of a checked out CVS repository
  - incredibly flexible options for assigning install roles to files/directories
  - ability to ignore any file based on a * ? wildcard-enabled string(s)
  - ability to include only files that match a * ? wildcard-enabled string(s)
  - ability to manage dependencies
  - can output the package.xml in any directory, and read in the package.xml
    file from any directory.
  - can specify a different name for the package.xml file

PEAR_PackageFileManager is fully unit tested.
