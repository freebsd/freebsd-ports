XParam is a general-purpose tool for parameter handling in C++. 

It allows object serialization and deserialization in a format that is
human-readable and -writeable, and is unaffected by issues of word-size
and endianity. The XParam format is also not confused by objects containing
pointers: it saves the objects in such a manner that their conceptual
contents can be restored perfectly.

For this reason, XParam provides an excellent tool for cross-program and
cross-platform communication. In future, XParam may also be extended to
allow cross-language communication, but for now it is only available in C++.
