C4: A CVS-like Frontend to Perforce

C4 provides a CVS-like feel to Perforce.  C4 is not a substitute for
CVS, in that it does not try to mimic CVS's command set.  Rather, it
provides a workspace (client) where every file is writable, and can be
modified on an adhoc basis.  C4 provides commands that search a
client, looking for files that have been added or changed, and runs P4
commands on them to add, edit, revert, refresh or update them.  C4
provides a control file that is placed at the top of each client to
set environment variables, such as P4PORT and P4CLIENT.  A manpage is
included.
