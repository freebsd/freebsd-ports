A simple OpenCL application that enumerates all possible platform and
device properties. Inspired by AMD's program of the same name, it is
coded in pure C99 and it tries to output all possible information,
including that provided by platform-specific extensions, and not to
crash on platform-unsupported properties (e.g. 1.2 properties on 1.1
platforms).
