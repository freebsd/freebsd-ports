The cpuid package provides information about the CPU running the
current program.

CPU features are detected on startup, and kept for fast access
through the life of the application. Currently x86 / x64 (AMD64)
is supported, and no external C (cgo) code is used, which should
make the library very easy to use.

You can access the CPU information by accessing the shared CPU
variable of the cpuid library.
