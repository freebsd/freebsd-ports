The aim of this project is not to provide a slightly modified clone of json-c.
It's aim is to provide

* a small library with essential json handling functions
* sufficiently good json support (not 100% standards compliant)
* be very fast in processing

In order to reach these goals, we reduce the features of json-c. For
similarities and differences, see the file DIFFERENCES.
