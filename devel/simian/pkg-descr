Simian (Similarity Analyser) identifies duplication in Java, C#, C, C++, COBOL, 
Ruby, JSP, ASP, HTML, XML, Visual Basic source code and even plain text files. 
In fact, simian can be used on any human readable files such as ini files, 
deployment descriptors, you name it.

Note: The port uses the java version by default. You can select the .NET
      version via WITH_MONO=yes, and disable installation of the java parts
      with WITHOUT_JAVA=yes.
