This library provides a framework for type-directed composition of value
editors (non-syntactic transformations).  The tools enable "deep
function application" in two senses: deep application of functions and
application of deep functions.  These tools generalize beyond values and
functions, via the DeepArrow subclass of the Arrow type class.
