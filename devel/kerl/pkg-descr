Easy building and installing of Erlang/OTP instances.

Kerl aims to be shell agnostic and its only dependencies, excluding
what's required to actually build Erlang/OTP, are curl and git.

All is done so that, once a specific release has been built, creating
a new installation is as fast as possible.
