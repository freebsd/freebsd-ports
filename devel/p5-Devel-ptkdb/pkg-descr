ptkdb is a debugger for perl that uses Perl/Tk for a user interface.

Features include:
	Hot Variable Inspection
	Breakpoint Control Panel
	Expression List
	Subroutine Tree

To debug a script using ptkdb invoke perl like this:
	perl -d:ptkdb myscript.pl

ptkdb can easily be used to debug CGI scripts if your webserver box is
capable of running Perl/Tk applications. Just change the shebang line of your
scripts to:
	#! /usr/bin/perl -w -d:ptkdb
