Chef Provisioning is a Cookbook and Recipe based approach for managing your
infrastructure. Users can codify their infrastructure and use Chef to
converge their infrastructure to the desired state. It has a plugin model
(called Drivers) to manage different infrastructures, including AWS, Azure
and Fog.
