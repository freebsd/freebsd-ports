This module provides an API for loading and saving of simple configuration 
file records. Entries in the configuration file are essentially key,value 
pairs, with the key and values separated by a single equals symbol. The 
key consists only of alphanumeric characters. There are three types of 
values, scalar values can contain anything except newlines. Trailing 
whitespace will be trimmed unless the value is surrounded in double 
quotes.
