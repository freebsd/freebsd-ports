This module provides an API for loading and saving of simple configuration
file records. Entries in the configuration file are essentially key,value
pairs, with the key and values separated by a single equals symbol. The
key consists only of alphanumeric characters. There are three types of
values, scalar values can contain anything except newlines. Trailing
whitespace will be trimmed unless the value is surrounded in double
quotes.
