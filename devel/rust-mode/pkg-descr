rust-mode makes editing Rust code with Emacs enjoyable. It requires
Emacs 25 or later, and is included in both Emacs Prelude and Spacemacs
by default.

This mode provides:
- Syntax highlighting (for Font Lock Mode)
- Indentation
- Integration with Cargo, clippy and rustfmt

This mode does not provide auto completion, or jumping to function /
trait definitions. See Auto-completion below for tips on how to enable
this.

If you are missing features in rust-mode, please check out rustic
before you open a feature request. It depends on rust-mode and
provides additional features. This allows us to keep rust-mode
light-weight for users that are happy with basic functionality.
