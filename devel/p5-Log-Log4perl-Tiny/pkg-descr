Log::Log4perl::Tiny yet another logging module. Nothing particularly fancy nor
original, too, but a single-module implementation of the features the author use
most from Log::Log4perl for quick things, namely:
- Easy mode and stealth loggers (aka log functions INFO, WARN, etc.)
- Debug message filtering by log level
- Line formatting customisation
- Quick sending of messages to a log file
