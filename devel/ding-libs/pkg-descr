Ding-libs provides utility functions to manipulate filesystem pathnames
(libpath_utils), a hash table which dynamically resizes to achieve
optimal storage and access time properties (libdhash), a data type to
collect data in a hierarchical structure for easy iteration and
serialization (libcollection), a dynamically growing, reference-counted
array (libref_array), and a library to process configuration files in
initialization format (INI) into a library collection data structure
(libini_config).
