This distribution contains a collection of utilities extracted from various
commandline-based programs I have written, in the hope of trying to find a
standard base to build these from in future.

Note that "commandline" does not necessarily mean "plain-text running in a
terminal"; simply that the mode of operation is that the user types a textual
representation of some action, and the program parses this text in order to
perform it. This could equally apply to a command input text area in a GUI
program.
