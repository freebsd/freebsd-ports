After src commit 8ccd0b876e, bear can no longer intercept compile commands using
the dynamic linker preload method.  See
https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear/issues/557 for details.

An alternative method for bear to intercept compile commands is via wrappers.
This method requires links under %%PREFIX%%/lib/bear/wrapper.d/ to any command
called to build your program.  The bear package now installs links to common
tools such as compilers and linkers.  If a link is missing, create it manually,
submit a bug report, or supply links in a custom directory passed as an argument
to bear's --wrapper-dir flag.

The --force-wrapper option must be supplied when using the wrapper method.
Example:

% bear --force-wrapper -- make
EOM
}
