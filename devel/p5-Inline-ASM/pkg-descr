Inline::ASM allows you to write Perl subroutines in assembly language.
Of course, many C compilers allow you to put assembly right in your C
code, so this module does not provide any new functionality. It does,
however, provide a feature most C compilers don't: you can mix different
assembler syntaxes in the same file!
