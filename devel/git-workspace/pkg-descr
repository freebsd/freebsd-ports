If your company has a large number of repositories and your work involves
jumping between a lot of them then `git-workspace` can save you some time by:
* Easily synchronizing your projects directory with Github, Gitlab.com or
  Gitlab self-hosted.
* Keep projects consistently named and under the correct path.
* Automatically set upstreams for forks.
* Move deleted repositories to an archive directory.
* Allowing you to access any repository instantly.
* Execute `git fetch` on all projects in parallel.
