The expecttest library implements expect tests (also known as "golden" tests).
Expect tests are a method of writing tests where instead of hard-coding the
expected output of a test, you run the test to get the output, and the test
framework automatically populates the expected output. If the output of the
test changes, you can rerun the test with the environment variable
EXPECTTEST_ACCEPT=1 to automatically update the expected output.
