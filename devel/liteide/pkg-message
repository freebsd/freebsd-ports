In order to have full Go support, please install LiteIDE Golang Tools:

	go get -u github.com/visualfc/gotools

and set LITEIDE_TOOL_PATH environment variable to point to the directory
where gotools binary is installed.  To have code autocompletion, you'll
also need gocode:

	go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode
or
	pkg install devel/go-gocode
