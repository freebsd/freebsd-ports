IPC::Open3::Simple aims at making it very easy to start a shell
command, eventually feed its stdin with some data, then retrieve its
stdout and stderr separately.

When you want to run a shell command and parse its stdout/stderr or
feed its stdin, you often end up using IPC::Run, IPC::Cmd or
IPC::Open3 with your own parsing code, and end up writing more code
than you intended. IPC::Open3::Simple is about removing this overhead
and making IPC::Open3 easier to use.

IPC::Open3::Simple calls IPC::Open3 and redirects stdin, stdout and
stderr to some function references passed in argument to the
constructor. It does a select on the input/output filehandles returned
by IPC::Open3 and dispatches their content to and from those functions.
