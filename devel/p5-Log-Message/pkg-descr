Log::Message is a generic message storage mechanism. It allows you to
store messages on a stack -- either shared or private -- and assign
meta-data to it. Some meta-data will automatically be added for you, like
a timestamp and a stack trace, but some can be filled in by the user, like
a tag by which to identify it or group it, and a level at which to handle
the message (for example, log it, or die with it)

Log::Message also provides a powerful way of searching through items by
regexes on messages, tags and level.
