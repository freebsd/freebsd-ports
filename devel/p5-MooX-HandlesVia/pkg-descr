MooX::HandlesVia is an extension of Moo's 'handles' attribute
functionality. It provides a means of proxying functionality from
an external class to the given atttribute. This is most commonly
used as a way to emulate 'Native Trait' behavior that has become
commonplace in Moose code, for which there was no Moo alternative.
