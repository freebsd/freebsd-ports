Module::Manifest is a simple utility module created originally for use
in Module::Inspector. It allows you to load the MANIFEST file that comes
in a Perl distribution tarball, examine the contents, and perform some
simple tasks.

Granted, the functionality needed to do this is quite simple, but the Perl
distribution MANIFEST specification contains a couple of little idiosyncracies,
such as line comments and space-separated inline comments.
