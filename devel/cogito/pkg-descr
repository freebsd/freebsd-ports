       Cogito - version control system

Cogito is a version control system layered on top of the git tree history
storage system.

The GIT itself is merely an extremely fast and flexible filesystem-based
database designed to store directory trees with regard to their history.
The top layer is a SCM-like tool Cogito which enables human beings to work
with the database in a manner to a degree similar to other SCM tools (like
CVS, BitKeeper or Monotone).
