This module was created as an alternative to use fields,
and uses Class::Accessor::Fast as a base

Creates accessors at compiletime

Have own default new method: it creates object as a blessed hash,
then locks keys to defined field list, and invoke init.
So, recommended usage inside packages, is access by hash keys
(it's 3 times faster then accessor). Since keys are locked,
you will not suffer from autovivification. Public interface
recommended to be documented as accessors.

Uses Class::C3
