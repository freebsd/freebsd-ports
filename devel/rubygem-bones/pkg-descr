Mr Bones is a handy tool that creates new Ruby projects from a code skeleton.
The skeleton contains some starter code and a collection of rake tasks to ease
the management and deployment of your source code. Several Mr Bones plugins are
available for creating git repositories, creating GitHub projects, running
various test suites and source code analysis tools.
