Pijul is a version control system based on patches, that can mimic the
behaviour and workflows of both Git and Darcs, but contrarily to those systems,
Pijul is based on a mathematically sound theory of patches.

Pijul was started out of frustration that no version control system was at the
same time fast and sound:

- Git has non-associative merges, which might lead to security problems.
  Concretely, this means that the commits you merge might not be the same as
  the ones you review and test.

- Handling of conflicts: Pijul has an explicit internal representation of
  conflicts, a rock-solid theory of how they behave, and super-fast data
  structures to handle them.

- Speed! The complexity of Pijul is low in all cases, whereas previous attempts
  to build a mathematically sound distributed version control system had huge
  worst-case complexities. The use of Rust additionally yields a blazingly fast
  implementation.
