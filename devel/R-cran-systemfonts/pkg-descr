Provides system native access to the font catalogue.

As font handling varies between systems it is difficult to correctly locate
installed fonts across different operating systems.

The 'systemfonts' package provides bindings to the native libraries on Windows,
macOS and Linux for finding font files that can then be used further by e.g.
graphic devices.

The main use is intended to be from compiled code but 'systemfonts' also
provides access from R.
