Parse gdb machine interface string output and
return structured data types (Python dicts) that
are JSON serializable.
Useful for writing the backend to a gdb frontend.
For example, gdbgui uses pygdbmi on the backend.

Also implements a class to control gdb, GdbController,
which allows programmatic control of gdb using Python,
which is also useful if creating a front end.

To get machine interface output from gdb,
run gdb with the --interpreter=mi2 flag.
