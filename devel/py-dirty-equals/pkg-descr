dirty-equals is a python library that (mis)uses the __eq__ method to make python
code (generally unit tests) more declarative and therefore easier to read and
write.

dirty-equals can be used in whatever context you like, but it comes into its own
when writing unit tests for applications where you're commonly checking the
response to API calls and the contents of a database.
