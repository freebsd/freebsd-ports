This package implements a PerlIO layer, that adds read / write
timeout. This can be useful to avoid blocking while accessing a
handle (file, socket, ...), and fail after some time.

The timeout is implemented by using <select> on the handle before
reading/writing.

WARNING the handle won't timeout if you use sysread or syswrite on
it, because these functions works at a lower level. However if
you're trying to implement a timeout for a socket, see IO::Socket::Timeout
that implements exactly that.
