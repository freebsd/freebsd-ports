Term::ReadLine::Gnu (TRG) is an implementation of the interface to the GNU
Readline Library.

This module gives you input line editing facility, input history management
facility, word completion facility, etc. It uses the real GNU Readline Library
and has the interface with the almost all variables and functions which are
documented in the GNU Readline/History Library. So you can program your custom
editing function, your custom completion function, and so on with Perl.

TRG may be useful for a C programmer to prototype a program which uses the GNU
Readline Library.

TRG is upper compatible with Term::ReadLine included in Perl distribution.
Term::ReadLine uses TRG automatically when TRG is available.
You can enjoy full line editing feature with Perl debugger which uses
Term::ReadLine with no patch.
