Perl 5 ships with a module called Term::ReadLine which is an interface
to command line editing and recall.  The version that ships with Perl
is only a stub, and offers little functionality.

This module supplements Term::ReadLine so that it uses GNU readline,
which comes with FreeBSD.  Applications that use Term::ReadLine do
not need to be modified to gain the benefits of this package; it will
happen transparently upon installation.
