This is a role which provides an alternate constructor for creating objects
using parameters passed in from the command line.

This module attempts to DWIM as much as possible with the command line params
by introspecting your class's attributes. It will use the name of your
attribute as the command line option, and if there is a type constraint
defined, it will configure Getopt::Long to handle the option accordingly.
