IPC::Run allows you run and interact with child processes, files, pipes,
and pseudo-ttys.  Both event-loop and procedural techniques are
supported and may be mixed.  Likewise, functional and OO API styles are
both supported and may be mixed.

Currently, pseudo-ttys operations are not supported in FreeBSD.
