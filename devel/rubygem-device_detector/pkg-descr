DeviceDetector is a precise and fast user agent parser and device detector,
backed by the largest and most up-to-date user agent database.

DeviceDetector will parse any user agent and detect the browser, operating
system, device used (desktop, tablet, mobile, tv, cars, console, etc.), brand
and model.

DeviceDetector detects thousands of user agent strings, even from rare and
obscure browsers and devices.

DeviceDetector is optimized for speed of detection, by providing optimized code
and in-memory caching.
