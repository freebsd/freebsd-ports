A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation and statistical
computing in R that is extremely fast, flexible and parsimonious
to code with, class-agnostic and programmer friendly. It is well
integrated with base R, 'dplyr' / (grouped) 'tibble', 'data.table',
'plm' (panel-series and data frames), 'sf' data frames, and
non-destructively handles other matrix or data frame based classes
(such as 'ts', 'xts' / 'zoo', 'timeSeries', 'tsibble', 'tibbletime'
etc.)
