This module provides a monotonic() function which returns the value
(in fractional seconds) of a clock which never goes backwards. It
is compatible with Python 2 and Python 3.

On Python 3.3 or newer, monotonic will be an alias of time.monotonic
from the standard library. On older versions, it will fall back to
an equivalent implementation:
