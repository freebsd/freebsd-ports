============================================================================

Libinotify functionality on FreeBSD is missing support for

  - detecting a file being moved into or out of a directory within the
    same filesystem
  - certain modifications to a symbolic link (rather than the
    file it points to.)

in addition to the known limitations on all platforms using kqueue(2)
where various open and close notifications are unimplemented.

This means the following regression tests will fail:

Directory notifications:
   IN_MOVED_FROM
   IN_MOVED_TO
   
Open/close notifications:
   IN_OPEN
   IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE
   IN_CLOSE_WRITE
   
Symbolic Link notifications:
   IN_DONT_FOLLOW
   IN_ATTRIB
   IN_MOVE_SELF
   IN_DELETE_SELF

Kernel patches to address the missing directory and symbolic link
notifications are available from:

=============================================================================
You might want to consider increasing the kern.maxfiles tunable if you plan
to use this library for applications that need to monitor activity of a lot
of files.

If the default on your system is too low, add the following line to
/boot/loader.conf, then reboot the system:

    kern.maxfiles="25000"
