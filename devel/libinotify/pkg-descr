This library provides inotify-compatible interface for applications,
that need to monitor changes happening in a filesystem.  It can be useful
when porting Linux applications, which often use inotify interface.

The IN_OPEN, IN_CLOSE_WRITE and IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE events are not yet
implemented, so the relevant tests are known to fail.
