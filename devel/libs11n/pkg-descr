s11n (an abbreviation for serialization) is an Open Source project focused
on the generic serialization of objects (i.e., object persistence) in the
C++ programming language.

The project's flagship library, appropriately named libs11n, can easily
serialize all manner of PODs (Plain Old Data types), most STL containers,
and user-defined Serializable types. By taking advantage of relatively
new, advanced C++ techniques s11n turns this formerly-difficult task into
child's play. It supports literally hundreds of millions of combinations
of standard containers out of the box. libs11n is 100% data-format
agnostic, and currently includes support for many formats, including 3 XML
flavours. (As far as i am aware, this exceeds support provided by any
other serialization framework, regardless of the implementation language!)
