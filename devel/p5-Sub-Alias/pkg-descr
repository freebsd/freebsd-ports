This module does a compile-time code injection to let you define subroutine
aliases based on its name.

This differs from p5-Sub-Name in that it defines a typeglob in a more correct
way and keeps you from manipulating the symbols table directly. You can use
the subroutine as if it was defined the ordinary way then.

This is particularly useful in the cases when you need to have several
identical subroutines with different names.
