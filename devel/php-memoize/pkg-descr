php-memoize is a PHP extension which transparently caches PHP functions, much
like Perl's Memoize module.

It comes with the following storage modules which can be enabled at compile
time:

- memory: Simple per-request module with no dependencies.
          Since this is a per-request cache, neither TTLs specified in the
          `memoize()` call or `memoize.default_ttl` are used.
- memcached: Uses libmemcached or the memcached PHP extension
