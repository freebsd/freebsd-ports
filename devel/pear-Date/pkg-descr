PEAR generic classes for representation and manipulation of dates, times and
time zones without the need of timestamps, which is a huge limitation for php
programs. Includes time zone data, time zone conversions and many date/time
conversions.

It does not rely on 32-bit system date stamps, so you can display calendars
and compare dates that date pre 1970 and post 2038. This package also provides
a class to convert date strings between Gregorian and Human calendar formats.
