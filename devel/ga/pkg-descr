The Global Arrays (GA) toolkit provides a shared memory style programming
environment in the context of distributed array data structures (called
"global arrays"). From the user perspective, a global array can be used
as if it was stored in shared memory. All details of the data distribution,
addressing, and data access are encapsulated in the global array objects.
Information about the actual data distribution and locality can be easily
obtained and taken advantage of whenever data locality is important. The
primary target architectures for which GA was developed are massively-parallel
distributed-memory and scalable shared-memory systems.
