IO::All - IO::All combines all of the best Perl IO modules

IO::All combines all of the best Perl IO modules into a single Spiffy object
oriented interface to greatly simplify your everyday Perl IO idioms.
It exports a single function called io, which returns a new IO::All object.
And that object can do it all!
