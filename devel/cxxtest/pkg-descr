CxxTest is a JUnit/CppUnit/xUnit-like framework for C++.

Its advantages over existing alternatives are that it:
 - Doesn't require RTTI
 - Doesn't require member template functions
 - Doesn't require exception handling
 - Doesn't require any external libraries (including memory management,
   file/console I/O, graphics libraries)

This makes it extremely portable and usable.
