Numba gives you the power to speed up your applications with high performance 
functions written directly in Python. With a few annotations, array-oriented 
and math-heavy Python code can be just-in-time compiled to native machine 
instructions, similar in performance to C, C++ and Fortran, without having to 
switch languages or Python interpreters.
