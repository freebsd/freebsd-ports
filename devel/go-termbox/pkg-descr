Termbox is a library that provides a minimalistic API which allows the
programmer to write text-based user interfaces.  The library is
crossplatform and has both terminal-based implementations on *nix
operating systems and a winapi console based implementation for
windows operating systems.  The basic idea is an abstraction of the
greatest common subset of features available on all major terminals
and other terminal-like APIs in a minimalistic fashion.  Small API
means it is easy to implement, test, maintain and learn it, that's
what makes the termbox a distinct library in its area.
