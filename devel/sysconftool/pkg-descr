sysconftool is a development utility that helps to install application
configuration files. sysconftool allows an existing application to be
upgraded without losing the older version's configuration settings.

sysconftool is a script that is used by applications to update configuration
files when a new version of the application is installed. sysconftool reads
the new application configuration files, reads any older versions of those
files that are already installed, then replaces the old versions with the
new ones, but preserving any custom changes contained in the old versions.

For more information on sysconftool, and why applications need it, see
the installed manual pages: sysconftool(1) and sysconftool(7).  With most
versions of the man command: "man 1 sysconftool" and "man 7 sysconftool".
