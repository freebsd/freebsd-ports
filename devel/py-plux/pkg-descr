plux is the dynamic code loading framework used in LocalStack.

Plux builds a higher-level plugin mechanism around Python's entry point
mechanism. It provides tools to load plugins from entry points at run time, and
to discover entry points from plugins at build time (so you don't have to
declare entry points statically in your setup.py).
