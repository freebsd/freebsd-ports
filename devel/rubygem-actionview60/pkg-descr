Action View is a framework for handling view template lookup and rendering, and
provides view helpers that assist when building HTML forms, Atom feeds and more.
Template formats that Action View handles are ERB (embedded Ruby, typically used
to inline short Ruby snippets inside HTML), and XML Builder.
