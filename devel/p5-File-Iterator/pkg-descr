File::Iterator wraps a simple iteration interface around
the files in a directory or directory tree. It builds a
list of filenames, and maintains a cursor that points to
one filename in the list. The user can work through the
filenames sequentially by repeatedly doing stuff with
the next filename that the cursor points to until their
are no filenames left.
