Styx is a scanner/parser generator designed to address some
shortcomings of the traditional lex/yacc combination. 

It has unique features like automatic derivation of depth grammar,
production of the derivation tree including it's C interface,
preservation of full source information and pretty printing to
faciliate source-source translation, persistence to aid rapid
interpreter writing. 

For application in contemporary computing environments, it supports
unicode, reentrancy and offers thread-safeness.
