OcempGUI is a small toolkit, which comes with various modules suitable for
event management, user interfaces, 2D drawing and accessibility.

OcempGUI enables developers to enhance their python and/or pygame applications
and games easily with graphical UI elements such as buttons, entry boxes,
scrolling abilities and more as well as simple event brokers or features, which
enhance the program by adding accessibility to its objects.

It can save a developer much time by providing a broad range of drawing
routines and ready-to-use event capable object types. The developer can focus
on the main tasks instead of taking care about needed low-level components,
which are given to him with OcempGUI.
