Tie::iCal represents an RFC2445 iCalendar file as a Perl hash. Each key in the
hash represents an iCalendar component like VEVENT, VTODO or VJOURNAL. Each
component in the file must have a unique UID property as specified in the RFC
2445. A file containing non-unique UIDs can be converted to have only unique
UIDs (see samples/uniquify.pl).

The module makes very little effort in understanding what each iCalendar
property means and concentrates on the format of the iCalendar file only.
