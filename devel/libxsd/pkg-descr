libxsd is the runtime library for the XSD XML Schema to C++ data binding
compiler.

XSD is an open-source, cross-platform XML Schema to C++ data binding
compiler. Provided with an XML document specification (XML Schema), it
generates C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as well as XML
parsing and serialization code. You can then access the data stored in
XML using types and functions that semantically correspond to your
application domain rather than dealing with generic elements/attributes
and raw strings.
