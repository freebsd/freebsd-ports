json-py is a simple, pure-python implementation of a JSON (http://json.org)
reader and writer. JSON is used to exchange data across systems written in
various languages. It is particularly suited to dynamic languages like Python,
Javascript, etc. JSON = Javascript Object Notation implies it is suitable for
AJAX applications that exchange data from servers to Javascript applications
running on web browser clients.
