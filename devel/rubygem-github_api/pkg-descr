A Ruby client for the official GitHub API.

Supports all the API methods. It's built in a modular way. You can either
instantiate the whole API wrapper Github.new or use parts of it i.e.
Github::Client::Repos.new if working solely with repositories is your main
concern. Intuitive query methods allow you easily call API endpoints.
