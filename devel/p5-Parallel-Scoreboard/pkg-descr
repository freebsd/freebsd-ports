Parallel::Scoreboard is a pure-perl implementation of a process
scoreboard. By using the module it is easy to create a monitor for
many worker process, like the status module of the Apache HTTP server.

Unlike other similar modules, Parallel::Scoreboard is easy to use and
has no limitation on the format or the length of the statuses to be
stored. Any arbitrary data (like JSON or frozen perl object) can be
saved by the worker processes as their status and read from the
manager process.
