nxt-python is a python driver/interface for the Lego Mindstorms NXT robot. The
1.x releases aim to improve on NXT_Python's interface and should be compatible
with scripts which use it while the 2.x releases improve on the API in
backwards-incompatible ways and will not work with NXT_Python scripts.
