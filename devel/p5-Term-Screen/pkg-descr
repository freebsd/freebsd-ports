Term::Screen is a very simple screen positioning module that should work
wherever `Term::Cap' does. It is set up for Unix using stty's but these
dependencies are isolated by evals in the `new' constructor. Thus you may
create a child module implementing Screen with MS-DOS, ioctl, or other
means to get raw and unblocked input. This is not a replacement for
Curses -- it has no memory.  This was written so that it could be easily
changed to fit nasty systems, and to be available first thing.
