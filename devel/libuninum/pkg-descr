This is a library for converting Unicode strings to numbers.
Standard functions like strtoul and strtod do this for numbers
written in the usual Western number system using the Indo-Arabic
numerals, but they do not handle other number systems.
The main functions take as input a UTF-32 Unicode string and
compute the corresponding unsigned integer.
