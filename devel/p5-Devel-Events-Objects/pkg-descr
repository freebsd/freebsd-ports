The Perl 5 module Devel::Events::Objects provides an event generator
and a handler for Devel::Events, that facilitate leak checking.
There are two components of this module: Devel::Events::Generator::Objects,
and Devel::Events::Handler::ObjectTracker. The first one uses some
trickery to generate events for every object creation and destruction
in code loaded after it was loaded. The second one will listen on
these events, and track all currently living objects.
