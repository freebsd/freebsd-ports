Darcs is a free, open source revision control system. It is:

* Distributed: Every user has access to the full command set, removing
boundaries between server and client or committer and non-committers.

* Interactive: Darcs is easy to learn and efficient to use because it
asks you questions in response to simple commands, giving you choices in
your work flow. You can choose to record one change in a file, while
ignoring another. As you update from upstream, you can review each patch
name, even the full "diff" for interesting patches.

* Smart: Originally developed by physicist David Roundy, darcs is based
on a unique algebra of patches.

This smartness lets you respond to changing demands in ways that would
otherwise not be possible. Learn more about spontaneous branches with
