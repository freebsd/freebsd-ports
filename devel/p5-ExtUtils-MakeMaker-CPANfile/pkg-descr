ExtUtils::MakeMaker::CPANfile loads cpanfile in your distribution and modifies
parameters for WriteMakefile in your Makefile.PL. Just use it instead of
ExtUtils::MakeMaker (which should be loaded internally), and prepare cpanfile.

As of version 0.03, ExtUtils::MakeMaker::CPANfile also removes WriteMakefile
parameters that the installed version of ExtUtils::MakeMaker doesn't know, to
avoid warnings.
