This module iterates over files and directories to identify ones
matching a user-defined set of rules.  The API is based heavily on
File::Find::Rule, but with more explicit distinction between matching
rules and options that influence how directories are searched.  A
Path::Iterator::Rule object is a collection of rules (match criteria)
with methods to add additional criteria.  Options that control
directory traversal are given as arguments to the method that
generates an iterator.
