Ceres is a library that aims at dealing with data in general, and
software development data in particular.

The initial goal of Ceres is to parse information in several ways from
the Perceval tool in the GrimoireLab project.

However, the more code is added to this project, the more generic
methods are found to be useful in other areas of analysis.
