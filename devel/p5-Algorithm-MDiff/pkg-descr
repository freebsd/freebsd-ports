Algorithm::MDiff is another form of comparing two different perl objects.
M-difference works as follows:  Two strings are m-different if at least m
of the characters in the string differ; that is, if m=3, then there are at
least 3 indices (i, j, k) such that str1[i] != str2[i], str1[j] != str2[j],
and str1[k] != str2[k].
