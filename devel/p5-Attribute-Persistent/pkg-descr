This module provides a way of abstracting away persistence of array and hash
variables.

It's useful for quick hacks when you don't care about pulling in the right DBM
library and calling tie and so on. Its job is to reduce fuss for the lazy
programmer at the cost of flexibility.

It uses MLDBM, so you can use complex data structures in your arrays and
hashes. It uses AnyDBM_File, so if you really care about which DBM you get, you
can modify AnyDBM_File::ISA in a BEGIN block after loading this module.
