Hyperscan is a high-performance multiple regex matching library. It follows the
regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre library, yet functions
as a standalone library with its own API written in C. 

Hyperscan uses hybrid automata techniques to allow simultaneous matching of
large numbers (up to tens of thousands) of regular expressions, as well as
matching of regular expressions across streams of data.
