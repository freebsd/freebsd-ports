QDevelop is a development environment entirely dedicated to Qt4.
QDevelop is not a Kdevelop like or reduced. It's an independent IDE dedicated
to Qt and is totally independent of KDevelop. Less complete, but faster,
light and especially multi-platforms. QDevelop and KDevelop have different
code sources.
