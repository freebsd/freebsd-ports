LLDB is a next generation, high-performance debugger. It is built as a
set of reusable components which highly leverage existing libraries in
the larger LLVM Project, such as the Clang expression parser and LLVM
disassembler.

This is a meta port. The Clang compiler is installed by the
devel/llvm38 port.
