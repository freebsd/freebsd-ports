CodSpeed is a continuous benchmarking platform that allows you to track and
compare the performance of your codebase during development.

It uses a smart runtime engine to measure the performance of your code in an
accurate and reproducible way without creating a huge runtime overhead, unlike
traditional benchmarks. CodSpeed produces detailed performance reports, helping
you improve your codebase performance, directly within your repository
provider(Pull Requests comments, Merge checks, ...).
