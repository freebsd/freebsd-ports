The Microsoft Build Engine is a platform for building applications. This
engine, which is also known as MSBuild, provides an XML schema for a project
file that controls how the build platform processes and builds software. Visual
Studio uses MSBuild, but MSBuild does not depend on Visual Studio. By invoking
msbuild.exe on your project or solution file, you can orchestrate and build
products in environments where Visual Studio isn't installed.
