gpm is a minimalist package manager for Go that leverages 
the power of the go get command and the underlying version 
control systems used by it to set your Go dependencies to
desired versions, thus allowing easily reproducible 
builds in your Go projects.

Go Package Manager makes no assumptions about your 
dependencies and supports Git, Bazaar and Mercurial 
hosted Go packages, for a smoother workflow be sure to 
check out gvp - the Go Versioning Packager which provides 
dependency isolation for your projects.
