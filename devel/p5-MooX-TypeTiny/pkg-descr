This module optimizes Moo type checks when used with Type::Tiny to
perform better. It will automatically apply to isa checks and coercions
that use Type::Tiny. Non-Type::Tiny isa checks will work as normal.

This is done by inlining the type check in a more optimal manner that
is specific to Type::Tiny rather than the general mechanism Moo usually
uses.

With this module, setters with type checks should be as fast as an
equivalent check in Moose.
