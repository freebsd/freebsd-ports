The traittypes package provides a reference implementation of trait types for
common data structures used in the scipy stack such as
* numpy arrays
* pandas and xarray data structures
which are out of the scope of the main traitlets project but are a common
requirement to build applications with traitlets in combination with the scipy
stack.
