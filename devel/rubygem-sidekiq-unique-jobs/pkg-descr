If your application code creates duplicate jobs, sidekiq-unique-jobs can ensure
only a single copy of a job is in Redis.  For instance, perhaps you create a job
to sync an address change with a 3rd party system every time a form is
submitted. If the form is submitted twice, you don't need to create the second
job if the first job is still pending.
