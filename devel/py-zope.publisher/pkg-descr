zope.publisher allows you to publish Python objects on the web.
It has support for plain HTTP/WebDAV clients, web browsers as
well as XML-RPC and FTP clients. Input and output streams are
represented by request and response objects which allow for easy
client interaction from Python. The behaviour of the publisher
is geared towards WSGI compatibility.
