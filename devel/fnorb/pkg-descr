Fnorb is a CORBA 2.0 object request broker (ORB) written in Python.  It
supports all CORBA 2.0 datatypes (including Any's) and provides a full
implementation of IIOP.  Fnorb is Python and CORBA/IDL specific which makes
it simple, light-weight and easy to use.  Fnorb is ideal for prototyping
complex CORBA architectures, for use as a scripting tool, and for building
test harnesses for CORBA development projects.

Fnorb is being developed at the CRC for Distributed Systems Technology based
at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
