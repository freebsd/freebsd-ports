While Eiffel is widely regarded as the best language for creating fast,
robust, scalable applications, EiffelStudioTM is the only tool for realizing
the full power of the Eiffel Development FrameworkTM. It is available under a
Dual Licensing model. Users can use either commercial or Open Source
licensing.

EiffelStudio is more than just an IDE.

Imagine being able to model your system as you think - capturing your
requirements and your thought processes in Eiffel. Then, when you are ready to
Design, you build upon the model you just created, still in Eiffel. And then
you implement, in Eiffel. You never need to throw anything out and start over.
You don't need extra tools to be able to go back and make changes in
architecture safely. Roundtrip engineering? It's built in by design. Testing,
metrics and productivity tools? They're built in.

And debugging? Eiffel's native Design by ContractTM prevents 90% of the bugs
from ever occurring in the first place - and what bugs remain are easily
traced and repaired, typically within ten minutes.
