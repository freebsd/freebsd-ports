The Calibrator is a small C program that is supposed to analyze a computer's
memory system and extract the following parameters:

    * number of cache levels
    * for each cache level: size, linesize, access/miss latency 
    * main memory access latency, number of TLB levels
    * for each TLB level: capacity, pagesize, TLB miss latency 

The Calibrator is a by-product of our work on Main-Memory Databases within
the Monet project.  The Calibrator is freely available for download and usage,
but we kindly ask all users to include a reference to the Calibrator's home
page whenever they refer to the Calibrator or publish calibration results.
