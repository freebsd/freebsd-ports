This perhaps ridiculous-seeming module was created to test routines that
manipulate random numbers by providing a known output from rand. Given a list of
seeds with srand, it will return each in turn. After seeded random numbers are
exhausted, it will always return 0. Seed numbers must be of a form that meets
the expected output from rand as called with no arguments -- i.e. they must be
between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). In order to facilitate generating and
testing a nearly-one number, this module exports the function oneish, which
returns a number just fractionally less than one.

Depending on how this module is called with use, it will export rand to a
specified package (e.g. a class being tested) effectively overriding and
intercepting calls in that package to the built-in rand. It can also override
rand in the current package or even globally. In all of these cases, it also
exports srand and oneish to the current package in order to control the output
of rand.

Alternatively, this module can be used to generate objects, with each object
maintaining its own distinct seed array.
