=====================================================================

Qt4 can be built with optional support for:
 - Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS)
 - Network Audio System (NAS)
 - Qt style that renders using GTK (QGTKSTYLE)

In order to enable them, you need add
	QT4_OPTIONS=	CUPS NAS QGTKSTYLE
to your /etc/make.conf and compile devel/qt4-corelib and 
x11-toolkits/qt4-gui ports.

Attention! Whenever you change the QT4_OPTIONS both
devel/qt4-corelib and x11-toolkits/qt4-gui ports must be rebuilt!
