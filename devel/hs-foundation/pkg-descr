This package has the following goals:
  * provide a base like sets of modules that provide a consistent set of 
    features and bugfixes across multiple versions of GHC (unlike base).
  * provide a better and more efficient prelude than base's prelude.
  * be self-sufficient: no external dependencies apart from base.
  * provide better data-types: packed unicode string by default, arrays.
  * Better numerical classes that better represent mathematical thing 
    (No more all-in-one Num).
  * Better I/O system with less Lazy IO
  * Usual partial functions distinguished through type system
