===============================================================================

In order to use the File System read/write monitor, you must chmod
/dev/devstat so that all users can open it read-only.  For example:

# chmod 0444 /dev/devstat

In order for this to persist across reboots, add the following to
/etc/devfs.conf:

perm	devstat	0444
