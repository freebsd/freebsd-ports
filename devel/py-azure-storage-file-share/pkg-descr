Azure File Share storage offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are
accessible via the industry standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Azure
file shares can be mounted concurrently by cloud or on-premises deployments of
Windows, Linux, and macOS. Additionally, Azure file shares can be cached on
Windows Servers with Azure File Sync for fast access near where the data is
being used.

Azure file shares can be used to:
- Replace or supplement on-premises file servers
- "Lift and shift" applications
- Simplify cloud development with shared application settings, diagnostic share,
  and Dev/Test/Debug tools
