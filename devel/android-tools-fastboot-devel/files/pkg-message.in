The port installed fastboot(1) under %%PREFIX%%/bin. However, there's
a different fastboot(8) under /sbin. To avoid accidentally invoking
the wrong command make sure either to

- adjust PATH environment variable to have fastboot(1) found first
- create a shell alias with absolute path to fastboot(1)
- create a symlink with different name in PATH e.g., under ~/bin
