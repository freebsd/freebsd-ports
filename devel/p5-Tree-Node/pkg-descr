This module implements a memory-efficient node type (for trees, skip lists
and similar data structures) for Perl.

You may ask "Why bother implementing an ordered structure such as a tree
when Perl has hashes built-in?" Since Perl is optimized for speed over
memory usage, hashes (and lists) use a lot of memory.

So the purpose of this package is to provide a simple low-level Node class
which can be used as a base class to implement various kinds of tree
structures. Each node has a key/value pair and a variable number of
"children" pointers.

How nodes are organized or the algorithm used to organize them is for you
to implement.

There is no Pure-perl version because this package was written to overcome
limitations of Perl.
