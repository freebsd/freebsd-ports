CodeWorker is a parsing tool and a source code generator, available in Open
Source (distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License) devoted to
cover many aspects of the generative programming. Generative programming is
a software engineering approach for producing reusable, tailor-made, evolvable
and reliable IT systems with a high level of automation.

The tool interprets a scripting language that drives the processing of parsing
and source code generation in a quite familiar syntax for developers. It
insists on adapting the syntax of the language to the particularities of tasks
to resolve (parse, code generation, procedural) and on offering powerful
functionalities to do intensive source code generation.
