A collection of Python deprecation patterns and strategies that help you
collect your technical debt in a non-destructive manner.

The goal of this library is to provide well documented developer facing
deprecation patterns that start of with a basic set and can expand into
a larger set of patterns as time goes on. The desired output of these
patterns is to apply the warnings module to emit DeprecationWarning or
PendingDeprecationWarning or similar derivative to developers using
libraries (or potentially applications) about future deprecations.
