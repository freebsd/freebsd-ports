txaio is a helper library for writing code that runs unmodified
on both Twisted and asyncio / Trollius.

This is like six, but for wrapping over differences between
Twisted and asyncio so one can write code that runs unmodified
on both (aka source code compatibility). In other words: your
users can choose if they want asyncio or Twisted as a dependency.
