The libdisasm library provides basic disassembly of Intel x86 instructions
from a binary stream.  The intent is to provide an easy to use disassembler
which can be called from any application; the disassembly can be produced
in AT&T syntax and Intel syntax, as well as in an intermediate format which
includes detailed instruction and operand type information.
