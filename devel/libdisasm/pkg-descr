The libdisasm library provides basic disassembly of Intel x86
instructions from a binary stream. The intent is to provide an easy to
use disassembler which can be called from any application; the
disassembly can be produced in AT&T syntax and Intel syntax, as well as
in an intermediate format which includes detailed instruction and
operand type information.
