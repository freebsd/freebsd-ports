Pyqtree is a pure Python spatial index for GIS or rendering usage. It storesand
quickly retrieves items from a 2x2 rectangular grid area, and grows in depth and
detail as more items are added. The actual quad tree implementation is adapted
from Matt Rasmussen's compbio library and extended for geospatial use.
