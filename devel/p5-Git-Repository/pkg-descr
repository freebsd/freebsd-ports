Git::Repository is a Perl interface to Git, for scripted interactions
with repositories. It's a low-level interface that allows calling any
Git command, whether porcelain or plumbing, including bidirectional
commands such as git commit-tree.

A Git::Repository object simply provides context to the git commands
being run. Is it possible to call the command()and run() methods against
the class itself, and the context (typically current working directory)
will be obtained from the options and environment.
