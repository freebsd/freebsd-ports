Fast CRC routines written in assembly language, callable using the C and Pascal
calling conventions, as well as directly from assembly language programs.

This Unix port contains routines for the calculation of traditional CRC-32
used by Zmodem, Opus, Ethernet, and many other protocols.

It also contains routines for the POSIX 1003.2 32-bit CRC calculation.

See ${PREFIX}/share/doc/fastcrc/index.html for reference.

This port requires ELF. It creates libfcrc.so.1, and includes <fastcrc.h> for
C programmers.
