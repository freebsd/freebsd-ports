Cello is a library that brings higher level programming to C.

By acting as a modern, powerful runtime system Cello makes many things easy that
were previously impractical or awkward in C such as:

- Generic Data Structures
- Polymorphic Functions
- Interfaces / Type Classes
- Constructors / Destructors
- Optional Garbage Collection
- Exceptions
- Reflection

And because Cello works seamlessly alongside standard C you get all the other
benefits such as great performance, powerful tooling, and extensive libraries.
