A program that takes as input a series of C source files and produces a
LaTeX or HTML document containing a cross reference of the
files/functions/variables in the program, including documentation taken
from suitably formatted source code comments.

The documentation is stored in the C source file in specially formatted
comments, making it simple to maintain. The cross referencing includes
lists of functions called, callers of each function, usage of global
variables, header file inclusion, macro definitions and type
definitions. Works for ANSI C, including a few gcc extensions.
