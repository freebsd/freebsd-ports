Shake is a Haskell library for writing build systems - designed as a
replacement for make. To use Shake the user writes a Haskell program that
imports the Shake library, defines some build rules, and calls shake.
Thanks to do notation and infix operators, a simple Shake program is not
too dissimilar from a simple Makefile. However, as build systems get more
complex, Shake is able to take advantage of the excellent abstraction
facilities offered by Haskell and easily support much larger projects.
The Shake library provides all the standard features available in other
build systems, including automatic parallelism and minimal rebuilds. Shake
provides highly accurate dependency tracking, including seamless support
for generated files, and dependencies on system information (e.g. compiler
version).
