Resources are a way to specify information of interest to program or
packages.

Applications use resource files to specify and document the values of
quantities or attributes of interest.

Resources can be loaded from or saved to resource files. Methods are
provided to search, modify and create resources.  Packages use resources to
hardwire in their code the default values for their attributes, along with
documentation for the attibutes themselves.

Packages inherit resources when subclassed, and the resource names are
updated dynamically to reflect a class hierarchy.

Methods are provided for interactive resource inspection and editing.
