IPC::Shareable allows you to tie a variable to shared memory making it
easy to share the contents of that variable with other Perl processes.
Currently either scalars or hashes can be tied; tying of arrays remains
a work in progress. However, the variable being tied may contain
arbitrarily complex data structures - including references to arrays,
hashes of hashes, etc. See the "REFERENCES" entry in this man page below
for more information.
