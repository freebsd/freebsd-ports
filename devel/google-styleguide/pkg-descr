This project contains coding style guides used at Google.  There are style
guides for AngularJS, C++, Common Lisp, HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C,
Python, R, Shell, and Vimscript.  Also included is:

- cpplint, an automated checker to make sure a C++ file follows Google's C++
  style guide
- google-c-style.el, an Emacs minor mode to provide Google's C/C++ coding style
  within Emacs
- google_python_style.vim, which indents Python code in the Google way when
  using Vim.

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the included
"XML Document Format Style Guide" may be helpful.  In addition to actual style
rules, it also contains advice on designing your own versus adapting an existing
format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements versus attributes.
