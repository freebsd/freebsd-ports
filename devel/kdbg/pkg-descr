KDbg is a graphical user interface to gdb, the GNU debugger,
to provide an intuitive interface for setting breakpoints,
inspecting variables, and stepping through code. 

* Inspection of variable values in a tree structure. 
* Debugger at your finger tips: The basic debugger functions
  (step, next, run, finish, until, set/clear/enable/disable
  breakpoint) are bound to function keys F5 through F10.
* Of course, lots of other basic functions: View source code,
  search text, set program arguments and environment variables,
  display arbitrary expressions
* Debugging of core dumps, attaching to running processes is
  possible. 
* Conditional breakpoints.
