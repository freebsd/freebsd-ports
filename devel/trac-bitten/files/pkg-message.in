If your system is the build master, i.e. it is the system that runs
the Trac instance and integrates with the SCM, you need to configure
Trac to load the Bitten plugin and give permissions to the build
slaves.

To run a build slave (which can also be on the same host), you need
to configure it by editing %%ETCDIR%%/bitten-slave.conf.
It is recommended to use a password secured Trac instance and set
username and password appropriately for the build slaves.

For more detailed instructions please have a look at the documentation
at http://bitten.edgewall.org/wiki/Documentation/install.html
