File::Slurp::Tree provides functions for slurping and emitting trees of files
and directories.

 # an example of use in a test suite
 use Test::More tests => 1;
 use File::Slurp::Tree;
 is_deeply( slurp_tree( "t/some_path" ), { foo => {}, bar => "sample\n" },
            "some_path contains a directory called foo, and a file bar" );

The tree data structure is a hash of hashes. The keys of each hash are names of
directories or files. Directories have hash references as their value, files
have a scalar which holds the contents of the file.
