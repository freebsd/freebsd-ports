Luka is an exception handling and reporting framework. It's useful to
look at it as an event handling framework.

It comes from operational understanding of networks.

Scenario that Luka is addressing is following: on a network with
multiple hosts running multiple applications, it is very difficult to
track operational status of all the functionality that those
applications and hosts are meant to deliver. In order to make it
easier, we decided to specify the error handling and reporting data
model that each component delivering functionality has to conform to.
What is a component? In most cases, it is a script, often run from
cronjob, in some cases it is a class in an application. In all cases,
a component has to successfully complete a task on which functionality
of an application, or entire network, relies on.

It is common practice that programmers choose their way of handling
errors and reporting. Luka is an attempt to standardize that process.
Its primary goal is to make it easier for smaller number of people to
keep larger number of applications and networks running.
