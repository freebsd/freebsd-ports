Makes ANSI escape character sequences, for producing colored terminal text and
cursor positioning, work under MS Windows.

ANSI escape character sequences have long been used to produce colored terminal
text and cursor positioning on Unix and Macs. Colorama makes this work on
Windows, too. It also provides some shortcuts to help generate ANSI sequences,
and works fine in conjunction with any other ANSI sequence generation library,
such as Termcolor.
