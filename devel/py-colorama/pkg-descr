Colorama makes ANSI escape character sequences (for producing colored terminal
text and cursor positioning) work under MS Windows.

ANSI escape character sequences have long been used to produce colored terminal
text and cursor positioning on Unix and Macs. Colorama makes this work on
Windows, too, by wrapping stdout, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (which would
appear as gobbledygook in the output), and converting them into the appropriate
win32 calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other platforms, Colorama
does nothing.
