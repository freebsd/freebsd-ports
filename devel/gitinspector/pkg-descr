Gitinspector is a statistical analysis tool for git repositories. The default
analysis shows general statistics per author, which can be complemented with a
timeline analysis that shows the workload and activity of each author. Under
normal operation, it filters the results to only show statistics about a number
of given extensions and by default only includes source files in the statistical
analysis.
