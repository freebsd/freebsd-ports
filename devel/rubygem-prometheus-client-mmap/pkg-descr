This Prometheus library is fork of Prometheus Ruby Client that uses mmap'ed
files to share metrics from multiple processes.  This allows efficient metrics
processing for Ruby web apps running in multiprocess setups like Unicorn.

A suite of instrumentation metric primitives for Ruby that can be exposed
through a HTTP interface. Intended to be used together with a Prometheus server.
