'cook' serves the same purpose as make(1), but uses a much more sane syntax,
and includes additional features that make it powerful enough to maintain a
single dependency graph for large projects (as things should be done in an
ideal world).  Don't be put off by 'cook' not being commonly available on
target machines, since 'cook' can automatically generate shell scripts that
make installing 'cook' on target machines unnecessary.
