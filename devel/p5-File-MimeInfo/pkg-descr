This module can be used to determine the mime type of a file. It
tries to implement the freedesktop specification for a shared
MIME database.

For this module shared-mime-info-spec 0.12 was used.

This package only uses the globs file. No real magic checking is
used. The File::MimeInfo::Magic package is provided for magic typing.

If you want to detemine the mimetype of data in a memory buffer
you should use File::MimeInfo::Magic in combination with IO::Scalar.
