The App::Cache module lets an application cache data locally. There are a
few times an application would need to cache data: when it is retrieving
information from the network or when it has to complete a large
calculation.

For example, the Parse::BACKPAN::Packages module downloads a file off the
net and parses it, creating a data structure. Only then can it actually
provide any useful information for the programmer.
Parse::BACKPAN::Packages uses App::Cache to cache both the file download
and data structures, providing much faster use when the data is cached.

This module stores data in the home directory of the user, in a dot
directory. For example, the Parse::BACKPAN::Packages cache is actually
stored underneath "~/.parse_backpan_packages/cache/". This is so that
permissions are not a problem - it is a per-user, per-application cache.
