The App::Cache module lets an application cache data locally. There are a 
few times an application would need to cache data: when it is retrieving 
information from the network or when it has to complete a large 
calculation.

For example, the Parse::BACKPAN::Packages module downloads a file off the 
net and parses it, creating a data structure. Only then can it actually 
provide any useful information for the programmer. 
Parse::BACKPAN::Packages uses App::Cache to cache both the file download 
and data structures, providing much faster use when the data is cached.

This module stores data in the home directory of the user, in a dot 
directory. For example, the Parse::BACKPAN::Packages cache is actually 
stored underneath "~/.parse_backpan_packages/cache/". This is so that 
permissions are not a problem - it is a per-user, per-application cache.
