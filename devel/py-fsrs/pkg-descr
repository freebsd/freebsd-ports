Py-FSRS is a Python implementation of the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler
(FSRS) algorithm. FSRS is a modern spaced repetition algorithm that is more
accurate than SM-2 (used by Anki) in predicting memory states.

Features:
- Implements FSRS-5 algorithm
- Predicts memory stability and retrievability
- Optimizes review scheduling for better retention
- Used by Anki 23.10+ as an alternative scheduler

This library allows you to build your own spaced repetition system or
integrate FSRS into existing applications.
