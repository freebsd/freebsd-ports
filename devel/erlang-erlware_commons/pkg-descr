Erlware commons can best be described as an extension to the stdlib
application that is distributed with Erlang. These are things that
we at Erlware have found useful for production applications but are
not included with the distribution. We hope that as things in this
library prove themselves useful, they will make their way into the
main Erlang distribution. However, whether they do or not, we hope
that this application will prove generally useful.
