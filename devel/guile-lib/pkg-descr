Guile-Lib is intended as an accumulation place for pure-scheme Guile modules,
allowing for people to cooperate integrating their generic Guile modules into
a coherent library. Think "a down-scaled, limited-scope CPAN for Guile".

Also, it can be seen as a code staging area for Guile; the Guile developers
could decide to integrate some of the code into guile-core. An example for a
possible candidate is SRFI-35.
