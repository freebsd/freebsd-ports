asteval provides a numpy-aware, safe(ish) 'eval' function Emphasis is on
mathematical expressions, and so numpy ufuncs are used if available. Symbols
are held in the Interpreter symbol table 'symtable': a simple dictionary
supporting a simple, flat namespace. Expressions can be compiled into ast node
for later evaluation, using the values in the symbol table current at evaluation
time.
