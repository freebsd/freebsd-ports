The Apache Portable Runtime is a library of C data structures and routines, 
forming a system portability layer that covers as many operating systems as 
possible, including Unices, Win32, BeOS, and OS/2.

This port also includes the APR-Util package, which contains some useful 
utilities built on top of APR.
