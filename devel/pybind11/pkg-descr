A lightweight header-only library to create Python bindings of existing
C++ code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent Boost.Python
library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in traditional
extension modules by inferring type information using compile-time
introspection.

This is the cmake part of pybind11.
