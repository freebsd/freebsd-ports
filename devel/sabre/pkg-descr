This project provides the Java-based implementation of the
Simple API for Binary REpresentations (SABRE). The library
defines observer-pattern interfaces for processing hierarchically
structured, binary-oriented documents, comparable to the Simple
API for XML (SAX). Processing can be modularized into a streaming
pipeline composed of separate stages, enabling the parsing,
transformation and serialization of large binary documents.

UDFLib is a Java-based implementation for creating UDF filesystem
images for DVDs according to ISO 13346, also known as ECMA-167.
