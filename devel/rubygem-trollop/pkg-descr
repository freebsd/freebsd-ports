Trollop is a commandline option parser for Ruby that gets out of your way.  One
line of code per option is all you need to write. For that, you get a nice
automatically-generated help page (fit to your screen size!), robust option
parsing, command subcompletion, and sensible defaults for everything you don't
specify.
