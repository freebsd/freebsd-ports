Abstract C99 library which implements a VT220 or xterm-like terminal
emulator. It doesn't use any particular graphics toolkit or output
system, instead it invokes callback function pointers that its
embedding program should provide it to draw on its behalf. It
avoids calling malloc() during normal running state, allowing it
to be used in embedded kernel situations.
