xxHash is an extremely fast non-cryptographic hash algorithm, working at speeds
close to RAM limits. It is proposed in two flavors, 32 and 64 bits. It
successfully completes the SMHasher test suite which evaluates collision,
dispersion and randomness qualities of hash functions. Code is highly portable,
and hashes are identical on all platforms (little / big endian).
