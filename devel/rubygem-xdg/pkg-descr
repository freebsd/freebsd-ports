XDG provides an easy to use Ruby library for working with XDG standards.

Presently, it only supports the XDG Base Directory Standard.

If your program utilizes user or system-wide support files (e.g. configuration
files), you owe it to yourself to checkout the XDG base directory standard.

You can learn more about the standard at:
