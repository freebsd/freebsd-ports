You have a lot of version control repositories. Sometimes you want to
update them all at once. Or push out all your local changes. You use
special command lines in some repositories to implement specific workflows.
Myrepos provides a `mr` command, which is a tool to manage all your version
control repositories.

It supports git, svn, mercurial, bzr, darcs, cvs, fossil and veracity.
