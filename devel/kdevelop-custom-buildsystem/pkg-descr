This plugin allows to handle arbitrary custom build systems with
KDevelop.

It supports setting up commands and arguments to build, configure,
clean, 'dist-clean' and install the project, so that KDevelop's
actions work as expected.

Additionally, it allows to setup include directories (or
import-directories) and defines for the project on a per-directory
basis.  This allows the C++ support and other language plugins to
find file-references without manually adding them via the
include-assistant.

This should help all those that have a special build setup to still
be able to embrace the features that KDevelop has to offer.
