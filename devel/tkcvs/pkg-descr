TkCVS is a Tcl/Tk-based graphical interface to the CVS, and Subversion
configuration management systems. It will also help with RCS. The user
interface is consistent across Unix/Linux, Windows, and MacOS X. TkDiff
is included for browsing and merging your changes.

It shows the status of the files in the current working directory, and
has tools for tagging, merging, importing, exporting, checking in/out,
and other user operations. TkCVS also aids in browsing the repository.
For Subversion, the repository tree is browsed like an ordinary file
tree. For CVS, the CVSROOT/modules file is read. TkCVS extends CVS with
a method to produce a "user friendly" listing of modules by using special
comments in the CVSROOT/modules file.
