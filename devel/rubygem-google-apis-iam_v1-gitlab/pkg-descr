This is the simple REST client for Identity and Access Management (IAM) API V1.
Simple REST clients are Ruby client libraries that provide access to Google
services via their HTTP REST API endpoints. These libraries are generated and
updated automatically based on the discovery documents published by the service,
and they handle most concerns such as authentication, pagination, retry, timeouts,
and logging. You can use this client to access the Identity and Access
Management (IAM) API, but note that some services may provide a separate modern
client that is easier to use.
