When using Sprockets 2.0 with Sass you will eventually run into a pretty big
issue. `//= require` directives will not allow Sass mixins, variables, etc.
to be shared between files. So you'll try to use `@import`, and that'll also
blow up in your face. `sprockets-sass` fixes all of this by creating a
Sass::Importer that is Sprockets aware.
