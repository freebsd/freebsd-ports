Create, read and write GEXF (Graph Exchange XML Format) graph files
(used in Gephi and others). Using the XML package, it allows the
user to easily build/read graph files including attributes, GEXF
viz attributes (such as color, size, and position), network dynamics
(for both edges and nodes) and edge weighting. Users can build/handle
graphs element-by-element or massively through data-frames, visualize
the graph on a web browser through "sigmajs" (a javascript library)
and interact with the igraph package.
