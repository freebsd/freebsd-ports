This module generates accessors for your class in the same spirit as
Class::Accessor does. While the latter deals with accessors for scalar values,
this module provides accessor makers for arrays, hashes, integers, booleans,
sets and more.

As seen in the synopsis, you can chain calls to the accessor makers. Also,
because this module inherits from Class::Accessor, you can put a call to one of
its accessor makers at the end of the chain.

The accessor generators also generate documentation ready to be used with
Sub::Documentation.
