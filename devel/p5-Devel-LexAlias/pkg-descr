Description from the home page:

Devel::LexAlias provides the ability to alias a lexical variable in a
subroutines scope to one of your choosing.

If you don't know why you'd want to do this, I'd suggest that you skip
this module. If you think you have a use for it, I'd insist on it.

Still here?

lexalias( $where, $name, $variable )

    $where refers to the subroutine in which to alias the lexical, it
     can be a coderef or a call level such that you'd give to caller

    $name is the name of the lexical within that subroutine

    $variable is a reference to the variable to install at that location
