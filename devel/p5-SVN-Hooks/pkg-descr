SVN-Hooks is a Perl framework for creating Subversion hooks.

It comes with a bunch of plugins (actually, sub-modules of SVN::Hooks)
that implement some of the most used standalone Subversion hooks
available, such as pre-commit hooks for enforcing:

- the log message format
- property settings
- the repository structure
- restrictions on the modification of repository areas (e.g., /tags)
- restrictions on filenames
- the integration with ticketing systems

It also comes with post-commit hooks for:

- sending commit emails
- updating configuration files in the server from changes made in
  the repository

But as a framework, it can be extended to implement all types of
hooks.
