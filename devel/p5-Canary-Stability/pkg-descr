This module is used by a guy who calls himself "schmorp" to produce
warnings if you're using any supported version of Perl.

This port is designed to prevent these warnings, but you can set
the "ACTIVATE" option to turn them back on. All of the instructions
in the warnings are considered harmful and should not be followed.
