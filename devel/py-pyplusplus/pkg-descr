Py++ is an object-oriented framework for creating a code generator for
Boost.Python library and ctypes package.

Py++ uses few different programming paradigms to help you to expose C++
declarations to Python. This code generator will not stand on your way.
It will guide you through the whole process. It will raise warnings in the case
you are doing something wrong with a link to the explanation. And the most
important it will save your time - you will not have to update code generator
script every time source code is changed.
