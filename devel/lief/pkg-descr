The purpose of this project is to provide a cross-platform library to parse,
modify and abstract ELF, PE and MachO formats.

Main features:
- Parsing: LIEF can parse ELF, PE, MachO, COFF, OAT, DEX, VDEX, ART and provides
  an user-friendly API to access to internals.
- Modify: LIEF can use to modify some parts of these formats (adding a section,
  changing a symbol's name, ...)
- Abstract: Three formats have common features like sections, symbols, entry
  point... LIEF factors them.
- API: LIEF can be used in C++, Python, Rust, C and Node.js (unofficial,
  AI-generated)

Extended features:
- DWARF/PDB Support
- Objective-C Metadata
- Dyld Shared Cache with support for extracting Dylib
- Disassembler: AArch64, x86/x86-64, ARM, RISC-V, Mips, PowerPC, eBPF
- Assembler: AArch64, x86/x86-64
