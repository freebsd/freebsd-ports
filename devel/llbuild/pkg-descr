llbuild is a set of libraries for building build systems. Unlike most build
system projects which focus on the syntax for describing the build, llbuild
is designed around a reusable, flexible, and scalable general purpose build
engine capable of solving many "build system"-like problems. The project
also includes additional libraries on top of that engine which provide
support for constructing bespoke build systems (like swift build) or for
building from Ninja manifests.
