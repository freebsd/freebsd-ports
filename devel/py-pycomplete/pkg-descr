With pycomplete, one can generate a completion script for CLI application that
is compatible with a given shell. The script outputs the result onto stdout,
allowing one to re-direct the output to the file of their choosing.

pycomplete accepts different types of objects depending on which CLI framework
you are using. For argparse, argparse.ArgumentParser is expected while for
click, either click.Command or click.Context is OK. pycomplete knows what to do
smartly.

Where you place the file will depend on which shell, and which operating system
you are using. Your particular configuration may also determine where these
scripts need to be placed.

Note that pycomplete needs to be installed in the same environment as the target
CLI app to work properly.
