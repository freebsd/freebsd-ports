Ultra-lightweight library to guess whether a file is binary or text, using a
heuristic similar to Perl's pp_fttext and its analysis. Tests are available for
these file types:

- Text formats: .txt, .css, .json, .svg, .js, .lua, .pl, .rst

- Binary formats: .png, .gif, .jpg, .tiff, .bmp, .DS_Store, .eot, .otf, .ttf,
		  .woff, .rgb

It has also tests for numerous encodings.
