gsubfn is an R package used for string matching, substitution and parsing. A
seemingly small generalization of gsub, namely allow the replacement string to
be a replacement function, list, formula or proto object, can result in
increased power and applicability. The resulting function, gsubfn is the
namesake of this package.
