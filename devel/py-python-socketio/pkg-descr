Python implementation of the Socket.IO realtime server.

Features
    Fully compatible with the Javascript, Swift, C++ and Java
        official Socket.IO clients, plus any third party clients that
        comply with the Socket.IO specification.
    Compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+.
    Supports large number of clients even on modest hardware when
        used with an asynchronous server based on asyncio, eventlet or gevent.
        For development and testing,
        any WSGI compliant multi-threaded server can be used.
    Includes a WSGI middleware that integrates Socket.IO traffic
        with standard WSGI applications.
    Uses an event-based architecture implemented with decorators
        that hides the details of the protocol.
    Implements HTTP long-polling and WebSocket transports.
    Supports XHR2 and XHR browsers as clients.
    Supports text and binary messages.
    Supports gzip and deflate HTTP compression.
    Configurable CORS responses to avoid cross-origin problems with browsers.
