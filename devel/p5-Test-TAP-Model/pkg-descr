This module is a subclass of Test::Harness::Straps.

It uses callbacks in the straps object to construct a deep structure,
with all the data known about a test run accessible within.

It's purpose is to ease the processing of test data, for the purpose of
generating reports, or something like that.

The niche it fills is creating a way to access test run data, both from
a serialized and a real source, and to ease the querying of this data.
