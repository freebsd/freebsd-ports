Data::Printer is meant to do one thing and one thing only: display Perl
variables and objects on screen, properly formatted (to be inspected by a
human).

Here's what Data::Printer has to offer to Perl developers, out of the box:
- Very sane defaults (I hope!)
- Highly customizable (in case you disagree with me :)
- Colored output by default
- Human-friendly output, with array index and custom separators
- Full object dumps including methods, inheritance and internals
- Exposes extra information such as tainted data and weak references
- Ability to easily create filters for objects and regular structures
- Ability to load settings from a .dataprinter file so you don't have to write
  anything other than "use DDP;" in your code!
