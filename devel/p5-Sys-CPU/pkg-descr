Sys::CPU - Perl extension for getting CPU information.
In responce to a post on perlmonks.org, a module for counting
the number of CPU's on a system. Support has now also been
added for type of CPU and clock speed. While much of the code
is from UNIX::Processors, Win32 support has been added
(but not tested).
