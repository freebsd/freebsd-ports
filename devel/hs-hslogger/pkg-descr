hslogger is a logging framework for Haskell, roughly similar to Python's
logging module.

hslogger lets each log message have a priority and source be associated
with it.  The programmer can then define global handlers that route or
filter messages based on the priority and source.  hslogger also has a
syslog handler built in.
