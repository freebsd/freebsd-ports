The VT102 class provides emulation of most of the functions of a DEC
VT102 terminal. Once initialised, data passed to a VT102 object is
processed and the in-memory "screen" modified accordingly. This
"screen" can be interrogated by the external program in a variety of
ways.

This allows your program to interface with full-screen console
programs by running them in a subprocess and passing their output to a
VT102 class. You can then see what the application has written on the
screen by querying the class appropriately.
