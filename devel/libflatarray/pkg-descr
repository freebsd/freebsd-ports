LibFlatArray acts as a highly efficient multi-dimensional array of
arbitrary objects (array of structs, AoS), but really uses a struct of
arrays (SoA) memory layout. It's great for writing vectorized code and
its lightning-fast iterators give you access to neighboring elements
with zero address generation overhead.
