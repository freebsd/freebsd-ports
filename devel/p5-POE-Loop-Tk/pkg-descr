POE::Loop::Tk implements the interface documented in POE::Loop. Therefore it has
no documentation of its own. Please see POE::Loop for more details.

POE::Loop::Tk is one of two versions of the Tk event loop bridge. The other,
POE::Loop::TkActiveState accommodates behavior differences in ActiveState's
build of Tk. Both versions share common code in POE::Loop::TkCommon.
POE::Loop::Tk dynamically selects the appropriate bridge code based on the
runtime enviroment.
