Language::Expr defines a simple, Perl-like expression minilanguage. It supports
mathematical and string operators, arrays, hashes, variables, and functions. See
Language::Expr::Manual::Syntax for description of the language syntax.

This distribution consists of the language parser (Language::Expr::Parser), some
interpreters (Language::Expr::Interpreter::*), and some compilers
(Language::Expr::Compiler::*).
