Boost.MPI is a library for message passing in high-performance parallel applications.

A Boost.MPI program is one or more processes that can communicate either via sending
and receiving individual messages (point-to-point communication) or by coordinating
as a group (collective communication). Unlike communication in threaded environments
or using a shared-memory library, Boost.MPI processes can be spread across many 
different machines, possibly with different operating systems and underlying architectures.

Boost.MPI provides an alternative MPI interface from the Python programming language
via the boost.mpi module. 

The Boost.MPI Python bindings, built on top of the C++ Boost.MPI using
the Boost.Python library, provide nearly all of the functionality of
Boost.MPI within a dynamic, object-oriented language.
