MooseX::NonMoose allows for easily subclassing non-Moose classes with
Moose, taking care of the annoying details connected with doing this,
such as setting up proper inheritance from Moose::Object and installing
(and inlining, at make_immutable time) a constructor that makes sure
things like BUILD methods are called. It tries to be as non-intrusive
as possible - when this module is used, inheriting from non-Moose classes
and inheriting from Moose classes should work identically, aside from the
few caveats mentioned below. One of the goals of this module is that
including it in a Moose::Exporter-based package used across an entire
application should be possible, without interfering with classes that
only inherit from Moose modules, or even classes that don't inherit from
anything at all.
