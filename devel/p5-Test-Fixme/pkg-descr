When coding it is common to come up against problems that need to be addressed
but that are not a big deal at the moment. What generally happens is that the
coder adds comments like:

# FIXME - what about windows that are bigger than the screen?
# FIXME - add checking of user priviledges here.

Test::Fixme allows you to add a test file that ensures that none of these get
forgotten in the module.
