py-repoze.what-pylons is an extras plugin for repoze.what
which provides optional and handy utilities for Pylons
applications using this authorization framework.

Some of the features of the plugin include:
    * The utilities are ready to use: There's nothing
additional to be configured before using.
    * 100% documented. Each component is documented along
with code samples.
    * The test suite has a coverage of 100% and it will
never decrease -- if it ever does, report it as a bug!
    * TurboGears 2 is officially supported as well.
