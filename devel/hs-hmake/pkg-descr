Hmake is an intelligent compilation management tool for Haskell
programs.  It automatically extracts dependencies between source
modules, and issues the appropriate compiler commands to rebuild only
those that have changed, given just the name of the program or module
that you want to build.  Yes, you need never write a Makefile again! 

A particular benefit is that hmake knows about interface (.hi) files.
Even though a source module has changed, if its interface file has not
changed, then other modules which import it do not need to be
recompiled. 

Hmake is compiler-independent, although it is based on some earlier
compiler-specific tools (hbcmake, lmlmake, nhc13make).  The
installation process automatically detects which Haskell compilers you
have, and sets up hmake to use any of them.
