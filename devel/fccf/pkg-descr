fccf is a command-line tool that quickly searches through C/C++ source code in
a directory based on a search string and prints relevant code snippets that
match the query.

Highlights:
 * Quickly identifies source files that contain a search string.
 * For each candidate source file, builds an abstract syntax tree (AST).
 * Visits the nodes in the AST, looking for function declarations, classes,
   enums, variables etc., that match the user's request.
 * Pretty-prints the identified snippet of source code to the terminal.
