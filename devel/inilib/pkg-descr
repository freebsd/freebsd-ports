inilib is a C++ library which provides a method of saving the "state"
of a program. inilib provides a means of storing a number of arbitrary
settings in memory with an easy access interface, as well providing
means for saving the information to and loading it from disk. Data is
stored in an easy to read format, allowing the user to modify any of the
information with a simple text editor.

inilib benefits the programmer by providing a simple, intuitive means to
store any data that can be expressed in std::string, int, double, or bool
types. In addition, inilib handles any conversion that may be necessary
to convert from one type to the other. Saving all information stored in
inilib to disk or loading information from disk requires only one command.
