Folsom is an Erlang based metrics system inspired by Coda Hale's
metrics. The metrics API's purpose is to collect real-time metrics
from your Erlang applications and publish them via Erlang APIs and
output plugins. folsom is not a persistent store. There are 6 types
of metrics: counters, gauges, histograms (and timers), histories,
meter_readers and meters.
