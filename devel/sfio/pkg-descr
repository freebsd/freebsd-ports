This is a portable library for performing stream I/O.  It provides similar
functionality to the ANSI C Standard I/O functions collectively known as
Stdio.  However, it is generally faster and more robust than most Stdio
implementations.

This version of the library has been ported to all known UNIX platforms
including various flavors of IRIX, SUNOS, Solaris, Ultrix, Linux, BSDI,
and MVS/OpenEdition.  The library handles 64-bit streams on platforms that
support 64-bit files.

A set of regression tests is available in the subdirectory
$(WRKDIR)/src/lib/sfio/Sfio_t.  These tests can be exercised by running
the shell script runtest after building the library.
