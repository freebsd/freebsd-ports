This package defines the type class MonadBaseControl, a subset of
MonadBase into which generic control operations such as catch can be
lifted from IO or any other base monad.  Instances are based on monad
transformers in MonadTransControl, which includes all standard monad
transformers in the transformers library except ContT.
