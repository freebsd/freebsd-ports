Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins jobs in YAML or JSON
format and uses them to configure Jenkins. You can keep your job descriptions
in human readable text format in a version control system to make changes and
auditing easier. It also has a flexible template system, so creating many
similarly configured jobs is easy.
