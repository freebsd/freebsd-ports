Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) offers a rich and complete
approach to expressing parallelism in a C++ program. It is a library
that helps you take advantage of multi-core processor performance
without having to be a threading expert. Threading Building Blocks
is not just a threads-replacement library. It represents a higher-level,
task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading
mechanism for performance and scalability.
