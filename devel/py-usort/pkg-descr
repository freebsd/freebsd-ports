usort is a safe, minimal import sorter. Its primary goal is to make no
"dangerous" changes to code. This is achieved by detecting distinct "blocks" of
imports that are the most likely to be safely interchangeable, and only
reordering imports within these blocks without altering formatting. Code style
is left as an exercise for linters and formatters.
