This is a specialized POD viewer to extract embedded tests and code
examples from POD. It doesn't do much more than that. pod2test does the
useful work.

After creating a Pod::Tests object, you parse the POD by calling one of
the available parsing methods documented below. You can call parse as many
times as you'd like, all examples and tests found will stack up inside the
object.

Once extracted, the tests can be built into stand-alone testing code using
the build_tests() and build_examples() methods. However, it is recommended
that you first look at the pod2test program before embarking on this.
