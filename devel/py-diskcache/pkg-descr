DiskCache is an Apache2 licensed disk and file backed cache library, written in
pure-Python, and compatible with Django.

The cloud-based computing of 2021 puts a premium on memory. Gigabytes of empty
space is left on disks as processes vie for memory. Among these processes is
Memcached (and sometimes Redis) which is used as a cache.
