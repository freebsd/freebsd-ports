LuaRocks allows you to install Lua modules as self-contained packages
called rocks, which also contain version dependency information. This
information can be used both during installation, so that when one
rock is requested all rocks it depends on are installed as well, and
also optionally at run time, so that when a module is required, the
correct version is loaded. LuaRocks supports both local and remote
repositories, and multiple local rocks trees.
