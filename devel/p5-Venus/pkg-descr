Venus provides an object-orientation framework and extendible standard library
for Perl 5, built on top of the Mars architecture with classes which wrap most
native Perl data types. Venus has a simple modular architecture, robust library
of classes, methods, and roles, supports pure-Perl autoboxing, advanced
exception handling, "true" and "false" functions, package introspection,
command-line options parsing, and more. This package will always automatically
exports true and false keyword functions (unless existing routines of the same
name already exist in the calling package or its parents), otherwise exports
keyword functions as requested at import.
