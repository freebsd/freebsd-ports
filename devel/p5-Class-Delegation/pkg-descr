The Class::Delegation module simplifies the creation of delegation-based
class hierarchies, allowing a method to be redispatched:
	* to a single nominated attribute,
	* to a collection of nominated attributes in parallel, or
	* to any attribute that can handle the message.

These three delegation mechanisms can be specified for:
	* a single method
	* a set of nominated methods collectively
	* any as-yet-undelegated methods
	* all methods, delegated or not.
