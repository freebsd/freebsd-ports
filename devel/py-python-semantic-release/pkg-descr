Python Semantic Release provides automatic semantic versioning for Python
projects. This is a Python implementation of semantic-release for JS by Stephan
BÃ¶nnemann.

The general idea is to be able to detect what the next version of the project
should be based on the commits. This tool will use that to automate the whole
release, upload to an artifact repository and post changelogs to GitHub. You can
run the tool on a CI service, or just run it locally.
