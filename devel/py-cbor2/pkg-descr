This library provides encoding and decoding for the Concise Binary Object
Representation (CBOR) (RFC 7049) serialization format.

There exists another Python CBOR implementation (cbor) which is faster on
CPython due to its C extensions. On PyPy, cbor2 and cbor are almost identical
in performance. The other implementation also lacks documentation and a
comprehensive test suite, does not support most standard extension tags and is
known to crash (segfault) when passed a cyclic structure (say, a list 
containing itself).
