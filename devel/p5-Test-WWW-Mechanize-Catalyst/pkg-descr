Test::WWW::Mechanize is a subclass of WWW::Mechanize that incorporates
features for web application testing. The Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst
module meshes the two to allow easy testing of Catalyst applications
without needing to starting up a web server.

Testing web applications has always been a bit tricky, normally
requiring starting a web server for your application and making real
HTTP requests to it. This module allows you to test Catalyst web
applications but does not require a server or issue HTTP requests.
Instead, it passes the HTTP request object directly to Catalyst. Thus
you do not need to use a real hostname: "http://localhost/" will do.
However, this is optional. The following two lines of code do exactly
the same thing:
