Shed Skin is an experimental compiler, that can translate pure, but implicitly
statically typed Python (2.4-2.6) programs into optimized C++. It can generate
stand-alone programs or extension modules that can be imported and used in
larger Python programs.

Besides the typing restriction, programs cannot freely use the Python standard
library (although about 25 common modules, such as `random' and `re', are
currently supported). Also, not all Python features, such as nested functions
and variable numbers of arguments, are supported.
