This module makes it easy to build classes using array based objects.
It's main goal is to allow one to create less memory hungry programs,
notably in memory-sensitive contexts such as mod_perl.

This module is little more than a cute way of defining constant subs in
your own package.  Constant subs are very useful when dealing with array
based objects because they allow one to access array slots by name
instead of by index.
