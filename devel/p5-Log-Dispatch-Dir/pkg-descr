Log::Dispatch::Dir provides a simple object for logging to directories under the
Log::Dispatch::* system, and automatically rotating them according to different
constraints. Each message will be logged to a separate file the directory.

Logging to separate files can be useful for example when dumping whole network
responses (like HTTP::Response content).
