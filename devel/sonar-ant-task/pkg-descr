The SonarQube Scanner for Ant is an Ant Task that is wrapper of SonarQube
Scanner, which works by invoking SonarQube Scanner and passing to it all
properties named following a sonar.* convention. This has the downside of not
being very Ant-y, but the upside of providing instant availability of any new
analysis parameter introduced by a new version of a plugin or of SonarQube
itself.
