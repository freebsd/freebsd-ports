B::Keywords supplies seven arrays of keywords: @Scalars, @Arrays, @Hashes,
@Filehandles, @Symbols, @Functions and @Barewords. The @Symbols array includes
the contents of each of @Scalars, @Arrays, @Hashes and @Filehandles. Similarly,
@Barewords adds a few non-function keywords (like __DATA__, NULL) to the
@Functions array.

All additions and modifications are welcome.
