QuickCheck++ is a tool for testing C++ programs automatically,
inspired by QuickCheck, a similar library for Haskell programs.

In QuickCheck++, the application programmer provides a specification
of parts of its code in the form of properties which this code must
satisfy. Then, the QuickCheck++ utilities can check that these
properties holds in a large number of randomly generated test cases.

Specifications, i.e. properties, are written in C++ by deriving
from the quickcheck::Property class. This class contains members
not only to express the specification but also to observe the
distribution of test data and to write custom test data generators.

The framework also allows the specification of fixed test data, as
can be done with more traditional unit testing frameworks.
