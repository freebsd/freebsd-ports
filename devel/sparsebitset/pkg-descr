Basically, if you need to set a large number of bits, or bits at extremely high
offsets, you probably want to use this Sparse BitSet. All other alternatives are
essentialy off the table; the Java BitSet class is a non-starter. Performance is
superior in almost all cases to the standard Java BitSet.
