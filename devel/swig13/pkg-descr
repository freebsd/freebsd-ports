SWIG is a tool for automatically generating the wrapper code needed
to link collections of functions written in C/C++ with interpreted
scripting languages.    Currently, SWIG supports :

        - Tcl
        - Python
        - Perl5
        - Java
        - Guile
        - MzScheme
        - Ruby
        - CSharp
        - Modula-3
        - Allegro CL
        - Chicken

Using SWIG, it is possible to greatly simplify interface development
and to put interesting interfaces on existing applications with
little effort.
