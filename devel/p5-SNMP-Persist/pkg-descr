The SNMP-Persist module is a backend for pass_persist feature of
net-snmp.

It simplifies the process of sharing user-specified data via SNMP and
development of persistent net-snmp applications controlling a chosen MIB
subtree.

It is particularly useful if data gathering process takes too long. The
responder is a separate thread, which is not influenced by updates of
MIB subtree data. The answer to a snmp request is fast and doesn't rely
on potentially slow source of data.
