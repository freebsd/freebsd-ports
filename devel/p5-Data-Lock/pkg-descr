Data::Lock makes the specified variable immutable like Readonly. Unlike Readonly
which implements immutability via tie, Data::Lock makes use of the internal flag
of perl SV so it imposes almost no penalty.

Like Readonly, Data::Lock locks not only the variable itself but also elements
therein. You can Data::Lock objects as well.
