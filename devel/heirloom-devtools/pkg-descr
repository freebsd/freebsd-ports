The Heirloom Development Tools package provides yacc, lex, m4, make,
and SCCS as portable derivatives of the utilities released by Sun
as part of OpenSolaris.  The OpenSolaris utilities were in turn
derived from the original Unix versions, and are assumed be conforming
implementations of the POSIX standard.
