List::Gen provides higher order functions, list comprehensions, generators,
iterators, and other utility functions for working with lists. walk lists with
any step size you want, create lazy ranges and arrays with a map like syntax
that generate values on demand. there are several other hopefully useful
functions, and all functions from List::Util are available.
