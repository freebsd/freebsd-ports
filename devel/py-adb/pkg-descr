py-adb is mainly targeted to users that need to communicate with
Android devices in an automated fashion, such as in automated
testing. It does not have a daemon between the client and the device,
and therefore does not support multiple simultaneous commands to the
same device. It does support any number of devices and never
communicates with a device that it wasn't intended to, unlike the
Android project's ADB.
