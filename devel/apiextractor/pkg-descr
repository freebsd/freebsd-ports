API Extractor library to build PySide

The API Extractor library is used by the binding generator to parse headers
of a given library and merge this data with information provided by
typesystem (XML) files, resulting in a representation of how the API should be
exported to the chosen target language. The generation of source code for the
bindings is performed by specific generators using the API Extractor library.

The API Extractor is based on QtScriptGenerator
