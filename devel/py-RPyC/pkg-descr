RPyC(pronounced like 'are-pie-see'), or Remote Python Call, is a
transparent and symmetrical python library for remote procedure
calls, clustering and distributed-computing. RPyC makes use of
object-proxying, a technique that employs python's dynamic nature,
to overcome the physical boundaries between processes and computers,
so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they were local.
