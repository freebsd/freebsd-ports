Cross platform GUI for D. Widgets, layouts, styles, themes, unicode, i18n, 
OpenGL based acceleration

- Crossplatform (Win32, OSX, Linux, FreeBSD and Android are supported in 
  current version)
- Mostly inspired by Android UI API (layouts, styles, two phase layout, ...)
- Supports highly customizable UI themes and styles
- Supports internationalization
- Hardware acceleration using OpenGL (when built with version USE_OPENGL)
- Fallback to pure Win32 API / SDL / X11 when OpenGL is not available (e.g. 
  opengl dynamic library cannot be loaded)
- Actually it's a port (with major refactoring) of GUI library for cross 
  platform OpenGL based implementation of Cool Reader app project from C++.
- Non thread safe - all UI operations should be preformed in single thread
- Simple 3d engine - allows to embed 3D scenes within GUI
