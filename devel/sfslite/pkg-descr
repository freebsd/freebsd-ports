This is a port of the SFS-Lite development libraries.  The SFS toolkit
was developed to support the SFS distributed file system (see
http://www.fs.net).  But because others use the toolkit for other
reasons, we're making SFS's libraries available as a separate,
lightweight package.  sfslite compiles much faster and can be
installed as different non-conflicting build modes (such as
sfslite-dbg or sfslite-noopt) so might be better for some applications
that need the SFS libraries but not SFS.

Maintained as port of the OKWS distribution by Maxwell Krohn.
