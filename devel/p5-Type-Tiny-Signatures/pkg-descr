This module uses Function::Parameters to extends Perl with keywords that
let you define methods and functions with parameter lists which can be
validated using Type::Tiny type constraints. The type constraints can be
provided by the Type::Tiny standard library, Types::Standard, or any
supported user-defined type library which can be a Moose, MooseX::Type,
MouseX::Type, or Type::Library library.
