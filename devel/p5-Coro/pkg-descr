This module collection manages coroutines. Coroutines are similar to
threads but don't run in parallel.

In this module, coroutines are defined as "callchain + lexical variables
+ @_ + $_ + $@ + $^W + C stack), that is, a coroutine has it's own
callchain, it's own set of lexicals and it's own set of perl's most
important global variables.
