sh is a full-fledged subprocess replacement for Python 3.8 - 3.11, and PyPy that
allows you to call any program as if it were a function.

sh is not a collection of system commands implemented in Python.

sh relies on various Unix system calls and only works on Unix-like operating
systems - Linux, macOS, BSDs etc.
