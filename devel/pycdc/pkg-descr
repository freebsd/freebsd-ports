NOTE: pycdc is also known as Decompyle++

Decompyle++ aims to translate compiled Python byte-code back into valid
and human-readable Python source code. While other projects have achieved
this with varied success, Decompyle++ is unique in that it seeks to
support byte-code from any version of Python.

Decompyle++ includes both a byte-code disassembler (pycdas) and a
decompiler (pycdc).
