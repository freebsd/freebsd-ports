The pyface project contains a toolkit-independent GUI abstraction
layer, which is used to support the "visualization" features of the
Traits package. Thus, you can write code in terms of the Traits API
(views, items, editors, etc.), and let pyface and your selected
toolkit and back-end take care of the details
of displaying them.

The following GUI backends are supported:
 * wxPython
 * PyQt
 * PySide
