omniORBpy is an object request broker (ORB) for Python which implements
specification 2.6 of the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA).
omniORBpy is implemented as a Python extension module (written in C++) to
provide bindings for omniORB4, a high performance C++ ORB.

This is the legacy version, based upon omniORB-4.1.
