This is a line editing library. It can be linked into almost any program to
provide command-line editing and history. It is call-compatible with the FSF
readline library, but is a fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).

The editline library was created by Simmule Turner and Rich Salz back in 1992.
At the time they chose to distribute the code under a "C News-like" copyright,
see the file LICENSE for details.

The small size (<30k), lack of dependencies (no ncurses needed!) and the free
license should make this library interesting to many embedded developers
