The autodie pragma provides a convenient way to replace functions
that normally return false on failure with equivalents that throw
an exception on failure.

The autodie pragma has lexical scope, meaning that functions and
subroutines altered with autodie will only change their behaviour
until the end of the enclosing block, file, or eval.

If system is specified as an argument to autodie, then it uses
IPC::System::Simple to do the heavy lifting. See the description
of that module for more information.
