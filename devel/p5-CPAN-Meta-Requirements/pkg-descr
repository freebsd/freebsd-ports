A CPAN::Meta::Requirements object models a set of version constraints like those
specified in the META.yml or META.json files in CPAN distributions. It can be
built up by adding more and more constraints, and it will reduce them to the
simplest representation.

Logically impossible constraints will be identified immediately by thrown
exceptions.
