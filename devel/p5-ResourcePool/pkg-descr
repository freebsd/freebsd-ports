The ResourcePool is a generic connection caching and pooling management
facility. It might be used in an Apache/mod_perl environment to support
connection caching like Apache::DBI for non-DBI resources
(e.g. Net::LDAP). It's also useful in a stand alone perl application
to handle connection pools.

The key benefit of ResourcePool is the generic design which makes it
easily extensible to new resource types.

The ResourcePool has a simple check mechanism to detect and close broken
connections (e.g. if the database server was restarted) and opens new
connections if possible.

If you are new to ResourcePool you should go to the ResourcePool::BigPicture
documentation which provides the best entry point to this module.

The ResourcePool itself handles always exactly equivalent connections
(e.g. connections to the same server with the same user-name and password)
and is therefore not able to do a load balancing. The
ResourcePool::LoadBalancer is able to do a advanced load balancing across
different servers and increases the overall availability by applying a
failover policy if there is a server breakdown.
