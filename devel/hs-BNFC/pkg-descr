The BNF Converter is a compiler construction tool generating a compiler
front-end from a Labelled BNF grammar. It was originally written to generate
Haskell, but starting from Version 2.0, it can also be used for generating
Java, C++, and C. Given a Labelled BNF grammar the tool produces: an
abstract syntax as a Haskell/C++/C module or Java directory, a case skeleton
for the abstract syntax in the same language, an Alex, JLex, or Flex lexer
generator file, a Happy, CUP, or Bison parser generator file, a pretty-printer
as a Haskell/Java/C++/C module, a Latex file containing a readable
specification of the language.
