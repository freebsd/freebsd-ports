HTML_Template_IT:
Simple template API.
The Isotemplate API is somewhat tricky for a beginner although it is the best
one you can build. template::parse() [phplib template = Isotemplate] requests
you to name a source and a target where the current block gets parsed into.
Source and target can be block names or even handler names.

Features :
  * Nested blocks
  * Include external file
  * Custom tags format (default {mytag})

HTML_Template_ITX :
With this class you get the full power of the phplib template class.
You may have one file with blocks in it but you have as well one main file
and multiple files one for each block. This is quite useful when you have
user configurable websites. Using blocks not in the main template allows
you to modify some parts of your layout easily.
