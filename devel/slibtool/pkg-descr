`slibtool` is an independent reimplementation of the widely used libtool,
written in C. `slibtool` is designed to be a clean, fast, easy-to-use
libtool drop-in replacement, and is accordingly aimed at package authors,
distro developers, and system integrators. `slibtool` maintains compatibility
with libtool in nearly every aspect of the tool's functionality as well as
semantics, leaving out (or turning into a no-op) only a small number of
features that are no longer needed on modern systems.

Being a compiled binary, and although not primarily written for the sake of
performance, building a package with `slibtool` is often faster than with its
script-based counterpart. The resulting performance gain would normally vary
between packages, and is most noticeable in builds that invoke libtool a large
number of times, and which are characterized by the short compilation duration
of individual translation units.
