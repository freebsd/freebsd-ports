radian is an improved console for the R program with multiline editing and
rich syntax highlight and more...

Under the hood, radian is built on top of the python library prompt-toolkit.
One would consider radian as a ipython clone for R, though its layout and
keybinds are actually more similar to those of julia.

radian is still under active developement, users should use it at their own
risks.
