Dulwich project aims to provide an interface to git repos (both local and
remote) that doesn't call out to git directly but instead uses pure Python.

By default, Dulwich' setup.py will attempt to build and install the optional C
extensions. The reason for this is that they significantly improve the
performance since some low-level operations that are executed often are much
slower in CPython.
