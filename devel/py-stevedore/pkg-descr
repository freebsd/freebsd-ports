Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure
and extend your application by discovering and loading extensions
("plugins") at runtime. Many applications implement their own library
for doing this, using __import__ or importlib. Stevedore avoids
creating yet another extension mechanism by building on top of setuptools
entry points.
