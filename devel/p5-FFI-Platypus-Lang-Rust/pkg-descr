This module provides native Rust types for FFI::Platypus in order to
reduce cognitive load and concentrate on Rust and forget about C
types. This document also documents issues and caveats that I have
discovered in my attempts to work with Rust and FFI.

Note that in addition to using pre-compiled Rust libraries, you can
bundle Rust code with your Perl distribution using FFI::Build and
FFI::Build::File::Cargo.
