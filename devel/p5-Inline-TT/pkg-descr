Inline::TT provides Inline access to version 2.0 and higher of the
Template Toolkit. This allows you to house your templates inside the
source code file, while retaining the ability to cache compiled
templates on the disk (via Inline's caching mechanism).

The names of the blocks in the template are exported as functions.
Call these with a reference to a hash of values, which will be used
for interpolation in the templates. This hash reference is the same as
the second argument to the process method of any Template object. The
output from template toolkit will be returned to you as a single
string. Note that leading and trailing spaces are trimmed, further the
template toolkit options PRE_CHOMP and POST_CHOMP are set. Currently,
there is no way to change these behaviors.
