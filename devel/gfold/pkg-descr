CLI tool to help keep track of your Git repositories, written in Rust

This app displays relevant information for multiple Git repositories
in one to many directories. While this tool might seem limited in scope
and purpose, that is by design.

By default, gfold looks at every Git repository via traversal from
the current working directory. If you would like to target another directory,
you can pass its path (relative or absolute) as the first argument
or change the default path in the config file.

After traversal, gfold leverages rayon to perform concurrent,
read-only analysis of all Git repositories detected.
Analysis is performed by leveraging the git2-rs library.
