Scalar::Util::Numeric::PP is written mainly for the convenience of Data::Sah, as
a drop-in pure-perl replacement for the XS module Scalar::Util::Numeric, in the
case when Data::Sah needs to generate code that uses PP modules instead of XS
ones.

Not all functions from Scalar::Util::Numeric have been provided.
