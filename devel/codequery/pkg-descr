This is a tool to index, then query or search C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Go
and Javascript source code. It builds upon the databases of cscope and
Exuberant ctags. It can also work with Universal ctags, which is a drop-in
replacement for Exuberant ctags.

The databases of cscope and ctags would be processed by the cqmakedb tool
to generate the CodeQuery database file.

The CodeQuery database file can be viewed and queried using the codequery
GUI tool.
