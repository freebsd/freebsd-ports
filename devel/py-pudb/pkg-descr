PuDB is a full-screen, console-based visual debugger for Python.

Its goal is to provide all the niceties of modern GUI-based debuggers in a more
lightweight and keyboard-friendly package. PuDB allows you to debug code right
where you write and test it--in a terminal. If you've worked with the excellent
(but nowadays ancient) DOS-based Turbo Pascal or C tools, PuDB's UI might look
familiar.
