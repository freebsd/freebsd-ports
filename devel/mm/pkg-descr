OSSP mm is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies
the usage of shared memory between forked (and this way strongly
related) processes under Unix platforms. On the first layer it
hides all platform dependent implementation details (allocation
and locking) when dealing with shared memory segments and on the
second layer it provides a high-level malloc(3)-style API for a
convenient and well known way to work with data-structures inside
those shared memory segments.
