The phpDocumentor tool is a standalone auto-documentor similar to JavaDoc
written in PHP. It differs from PHPDoc in that it is MUCH faster, parses a much
wider range of php files, and comes with many customizations including 11 HTML
templates, Windows help file CHM output, PDF output, and XML DocBook peardoc2
output for use with documenting PEAR. In addition, it can do PHPXref source
code highlighting and linking.
