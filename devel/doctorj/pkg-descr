DoctorJ is a set of applications that analyze Java code. Documentation is 
verified for compliance with the standard and for accuracy against the 
code, beyond what javadoc does. Statistics for a file or project can be 
generated, including the number of lines of code per class and method, 
and the overall total. A syntax analyzer is in development.
