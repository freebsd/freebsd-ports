IO::Prompt::Tiny is an extremely simple prompting module, based on the extremely
simple prompt offered by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.In many cases, that's all you need
and this module gives it to you without all the overhead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker
just to prompt for input.

It doesn't do any validation, coloring, menus, timeouts, or any of the wild,
crazy, cool stuff that other prompting modules do. It just prompts with a
default. That's it!
