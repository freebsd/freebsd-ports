Class::Spiffy is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented
(OO) programming in Perl. Class::Spiffy combines the best parts of
Exporter.pm, base.pm, mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation
class. It attempts to fix all the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO,
in a clean, straightforward and (perhaps someday) standard way.
