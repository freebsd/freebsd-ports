MultiJSON is a generic swappable back-end for JSON handling.

Lots of Ruby libraries parse JSON and everyone has their favorite JSON coder.
Instead of choosing a single JSON coder and forcing users of your library to be
stuck with it, you can use MultiJSON instead, which will simply choose the
fastest available JSON coder.
