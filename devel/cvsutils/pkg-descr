CVSU: CVS Utilites

The idea of CVS Utilities is to facilitate working with the files in
the working directory of a developer using CVS.

cvsu:       cvs update offline
cvsco:      cruel checkout
cvsdiscard: discard local changes
cvsdo:      simulates some of the CVS commands
cvspurge:   make maintainer-clean
cvsdiff:    cvs diff offline
cvschroot:  change CVS/Root recursively
cvsrmadm:   remove all CVS directories recursively
