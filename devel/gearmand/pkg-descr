Gearman provides a generic framework to farm out work to other
machines or dispatch function calls to machines that are better suited
to do the work. It allows you to do work in parallel, to load balance
processing, and to call functions between languages. It can be used in
a variety of applications, from high-availability web sites to the
transport for database replication.
