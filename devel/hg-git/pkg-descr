The Hg-Git plugin is an extension for Mercurial, adding the ability to push to
and pull from a Git server repository from Mercurial. This means you can
collaborate on Git based projects from Mercurial, or use a Git server as a
collaboration point for a team with developers using both Git and Mercurial.

The Hg-Git plugin can convert commits / changesets losslessly from one system
to another, so you can push via a Mercurial repository and another Mercurial
client can pull it. In theory, the changeset IDs should not change, although
this may not hold true for complex histories.

This plugin is implemented entirely in Python - there are no Git binary
dependencies, you do not need to have Git installed on your system.

*** WARNING: Do not use this software in data critical production environments,
only in safe test environments! This software is still BETA! ***

The plugin is basically functional and usable now, but there are still some
edge cases. However, there are several people using it effectively, so please
test it yourself and report encountered bugs upstream (see website). Thanks!
