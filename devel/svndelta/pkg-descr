svndelta helps control Subversion-managed projects. svndelta summarizes
project changes (including lines of code) and also adds to and removes
from Subversion the files that have been added and removed locally.

svndelta filters project changes by using .svnignore files, both
system-wide and locally. Thus, for example, svndelta will not attempt to
add backup files or object files to a project, or include them in
summaries of changes.

Requires ruby.
