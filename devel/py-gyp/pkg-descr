GYP is a Meta-Build system: a build system that generates other
build systems.  It is intended to support large projects that need
to be built on multiple platforms (e.g., Mac, Windows, Linux), and
where it is important that the project can be built using the IDEs
that are popular on each platform as if the project is a "native" one.
