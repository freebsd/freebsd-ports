Distribute is intended to replace Setuptools as the standard method
for working with Python module distributions.

    The project has two goals:

    - Providing a backward compatible version to replace Setuptools
      and make all distributions that depend on Setuptools work as
      before, but with less bugs and behavioral issues.

    - Re-factoring the code, and releasing it in several distributions.
      This work is being done in the 0.7.x series but not yet released.
