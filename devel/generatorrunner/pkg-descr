GeneratorRunner is a tool that eases the development of binding generators
for C++ and Qt-based libraries by providing a framework to help automating
most of the process. It uses the ApiExtractor library to parse the header
files and manipulate the classes information while generating the binding
code using front-end modules provided by the user.

GeneratorRunner is based on the QtScriptGenerator project
