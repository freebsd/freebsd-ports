The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is a very useful collection of
Perl code. It has several indices of the files that it hosts, including a file
named "02packages.details.txt.gz" in the "modules" directory. This file
contains lots of useful information and this module provides a simple interface
to the data contained within.
