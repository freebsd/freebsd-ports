This package provides Python bindings for the ISA-L library. The Intel(R)
Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library (ISA-L) implements several key
algorithms in assembly language. This includes a variety of functions to provide
zlib/gzip-compatible compression.

python-isal provides the bindings by offering four modules:
- isal_zlib: A drop-in replacement for the zlib module that uses ISA-L to
  accelerate its performance.
- igzip: A drop-in replacement for the gzip module that uses isal_zlib instead
  of zlib to perform its compression and checksum tasks, which improves
  performance.
- igzip_threaded offers an open function which returns buffered read or write
  streams that can be used to read and write large files while escaping the GIL
  using one or multiple threads. This functionality only works for streaming,
  seeking is not supported.
- igzip_lib: Provides compression functions which have full access to the API of
  ISA-L's compression functions.
