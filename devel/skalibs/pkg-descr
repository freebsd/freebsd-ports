skalibs is a package centralizing the public-domain C development files
used for building other skarnet.org software.

skalibs can also be used as a sound basic start for C development.
There are a lot of general-purpose libraries out there;
but if your main goal is to produce small and secure C code,
you will like skalibs.

skalibs contains exclusively public-domain code.
So you can redistribute it as you want, and it does not prevent you
from distributing any of your executables.
