Gitblit is an open-source, pure Java stack for managing, viewing,
and serving Git repositories. It's designed primarily as a tool for
small workgroups who want to host centralized repositories.

Gitblit WAR is what you should download if you already have a servlet
container available that you wish to use. Jetty 6/7/8 and Tomcat
6/7 are known to work. Generally, any Servlet 2.5 or Servlet 3.0
container should work.

Gitblit can be used as a dumb repository viewer with no administrative
controls or user accounts. Gitblit can be used as a complete Git
stack for cloning, pushing, and repository access control. Gitblit
can be used without any other Git tooling (including actual Git)
or it can cooperate with your established tools.
