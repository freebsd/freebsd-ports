This is the cons-test regression test suite for the Cons software
construction utility.

Cons is a Perl-based make replacement.  It is not compatible with make,
but has a number of powerful capabilities not found in other software
construction systems, including make.

This package contains only the tests, not Cons itself.  You should
look for the "cons" package that corresponds to the version number of
this package.  See that package for all the details about Cons.
