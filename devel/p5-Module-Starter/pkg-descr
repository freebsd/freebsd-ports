Module::Starter - a simple starter kit for any module

Module::Starter is used to create a skeletal CPAN distribution,
including basic builder scripts, tests, documentation, and module code.

If you're not looking to extend or alter the behavior of this module,
you probably want to look at module-starter instead.
