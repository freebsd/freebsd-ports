SFML is a portable and easy to use multimedia API written in C++.
You can see it as a modern, object-oriented alternative to SDL.

SFML is composed of several packages to perfectly suit your needs.
You can use SFML as a minimal windowing system to interface with
OpenGL, or as a fully-featured multimedia library for building games
or interactive programs.
