This module define a subroutine that let you evaluate Perl code in a specific
context. The code can be passed directly as a string or as a file name to read
from. It also provides some subroutines to let you define and optionally share
variables and subroutines between your code and the code you wish to evaluate.
Finally there is some support for running your code in a safe compartment.
