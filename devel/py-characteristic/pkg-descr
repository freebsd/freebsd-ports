characteristic is a Python package with class decorators that ease the
chores of implementing the most common attribute-related object protocols.

You just specify the attributes to work with and characteristic gives you
any or all of:
  a nice human-readable __repr__,
  a complete set of comparison methods,
  immutability for attributes,
  and a kwargs-based initializer
without writing dull boilerplate code again and again.
