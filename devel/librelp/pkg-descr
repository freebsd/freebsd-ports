librelp is an easy to use library for the RELP protocol. RELP in turn
provides reliable event logging over the network (and consequently
RELP stands for Reliable Event Logging Protocol).

RELP (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even
when connections break and a peer becomes unavailable. The current
version of RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message
duplication after a session has been broken due to network problems.
In this case, a few messages may be duplicated (a problem that also
exists with plain TCP syslog). Future versions of RELP will address
this shortcoming.
