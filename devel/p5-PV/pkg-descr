INTRO
=====

I needed a basic text-mode GUI framework to implement some
nice-looking proggies on Linux. Didn't find any around, so necessity
became the mother of PerlVision. And this beast kept growing as I made
love to Perl, so now it's far from 'basic'. Provides 90% of the
features you'd want for a user interface, including check boxes,
radio buttons, three different styles (!) of pushbuttons, single and
multiple selection list boxes, an extensible edit box that does
auto-wrapping, a scrollable viewbox, single line text entry fields, a
menu bar with pulldown menus, and full pop-up dialog boxes with multiple
controls.

This version of PerlVision uses Will Setzer's Curses.pm dynaload
module for Perl, so you need to get and compile that first, from
ftp://ftp.ncsu.edu/pub/math/wsetzer/cursperl<whatever>.

PerlVision will only work with Perl 5+ of-course (upgrade || die()!).
