rebar is an Erlang build tool that makes it easy to compile and test Erlang
applications, port drivers and releases.

rebar is a self-contained Erlang script, so it's easy to distribute or even
embed directly in a project. Where possible, rebar uses standard Erlang/OTP
conventions for project structures, thus minimizing the amount of build
configuration work. rebar also provides dependency management, enabling
application writers to easily re-use common libraries from a variety of
locations (git, hg, etc).
