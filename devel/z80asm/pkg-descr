z80asm is an assembler for the Z80 microprcessor. The assembler aims to be
portable and complete. Of course it assembles all official mnemonics, but it
also aims to assemble the unofficial mnemonics.

The assembler features the output of listing files which show the source with
the assembled codes and address next to it.

It also allows outputting of label files, in a format which can be included by
other assembler source files.

Other noteworthy features are complete calculation capabilities, conditional
assembling of parts of the code, and inclusion of other source files.

The assembler was written with the MSX computer in mind as the target platform,
but it can be used for any system with a Z80 in it. The original idea was to
make header files with labels of MSX specific addresses (BIOS, BDOS, system
variables), but nothing like this has been done yet.
