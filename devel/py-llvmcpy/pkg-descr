The main goal of llvmcpy is to provide Python bindings for the LLVM project
that are fast and require the lowest possible maintainance effort. To achive
this, we use CFFI to parse the (slightly adapted) header files for the LLVM-C
API and automatically generate a set of classes and functions to interact with
them in a Pythonic way.
