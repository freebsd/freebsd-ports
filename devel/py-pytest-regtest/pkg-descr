pytest-regtest is a pytest-plugin for implementing regression tests.
Compared to functional testing a regression test does not test if
software produces correct results, instead a regression test checks
if software behaves the same way as it did before introduced changes.

pytest-regtest allows capturing selected output which then can be
compared to the captured output from former runs.
