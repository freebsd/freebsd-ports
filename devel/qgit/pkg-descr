QGit is a git GUI viewer built on Qt/C++.
With qgit you will be able to browse revisions history, view patch content and
changed files, graphically following different development branches.

Features :
- View revisions, diffs, files history, files annotation, archive tree.
- Commit changes visually cherry picking modified files.
- Apply or format patch series from selected commits, drag and drop commits
between two instances of qgit.
- Associate commands sequences, scripts and anything else executable to a
custom action. Actions can be run from menu and corresponding output is grabbed
by a terminal window. qgit implements a GUI for the most common StGIT commands
like push/pop and apply/format patches. You can also create new patches or
refresh current top one using the same semantics of git commit,
i.e. cherry picking single modified files.
