POE::Component::Syndicator is a base class for POE components which need to
handle a persistent resource (e.g. a connection to an IRC server) for one or
more sessions in an extendable way.

This module (as well as Object::Pluggable, which this module inherits from)
was born out of POE::Component::IRC, the guts of which quickly spread to
other POE components. Now they can all inherit from this module instead.

The component provides an event queue, which can be managed with the methods
documented below. It handles delivery of events to the object itself, all
interested plugins, and all interested sessions.
