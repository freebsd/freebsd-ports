The "findlib" library provides a scheme to manage reusable software
components (packages), and includes tools that support this
scheme. Packages are collections of OCaml modules for which
metainformation can be stored. The packages are kept in the filesystem
hierarchy, but with strict directory structure. The library contains
functions to look the directory up that stores a package, to query
metainformation about a package, and to retrieve dependency
information about multiple packages. There is also a tool that allows
the user to enter queries on the command-line. In order to simplify
compilation and linkage, there are new frontends of the various OCaml
compilers that can directly deal with packages.
