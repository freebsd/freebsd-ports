The Storable package brings you persistency for your perl data
structures containing SCALAR, ARRAY, HASH or REF objects, i.e. anything
that can be convenientely stored to disk and retrieved at a later time.

It can be used in the regular procedural way by calling store with a
reference to the object to store, and providing a file name. The routine
returns undef for I/O problems or other internal error, a true value
otherwise.  Serious errors are propagated as a die exception.

To retrieve data stored to disk, you use retrieve with a file name, and
the objects stored into that file are recreated into memory for you, and
a reference to the root object is returned. In case an I/O error
occurred while reading, undef is returned instead. Other serious errors
are propagated via die.
