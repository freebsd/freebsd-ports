MouseX::App::Cmd marries App::Cmd with MouseX::Getopt. It is a direct port of
MooseX::App::Cmd to Mouse.

Use it like App::Cmd advises (especially see App::Cmd::Tutorial), swapping
App::Cmd::Command for MouseX::App::Cmd::Command.

Then you can write your Mouse commands as Mouse classes, with MouseX::Getopt
defining the options for you instead of opt_spec returning a
Getopt::Long::Descriptive spec.
