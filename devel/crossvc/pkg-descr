CrossVC is a graphical interface for the cvs client command line tool
on the Unix, Windows and Mac OS X platform.

It allows to load modules from a server (checkout), create modules on
the server (import), as well as checking the state of directories and
individual files or updating them. Basic operations like add, remove
and commit are supported as matter of course, just like showing the
actual differences between the server version and the local sandbox,
graphical display of the version tree, and manifoldy graphical support
of project maintenance. All actions are logged on the cvs server
(configurable via history), and are therewith comprehensible.
