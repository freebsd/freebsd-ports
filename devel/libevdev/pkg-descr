libevdev is a wrapper library for evdev devices. It moves the common
tasks when dealing with evdev devices into a library and provides a
library interface to the callers, thus avoiding erroneous ioctls, etc.

The eventual goal is that libevdev wraps all ioctls available to evdev
devices, thus making direct access unnecessary.
