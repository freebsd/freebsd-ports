Java-Readline is a port of GNU Readline for Java. Or, to be more
precise, it is a JNI-wrapper to Readline. It is distributed under the
LGPL.

You must call Readline.load(ReadlineLibrary lib); before using any
other methods.  If you omit the call to the load()-method, the pure
Java fallback solution is used.  Possible values for lib are:

ReadlineLibrary.PureJava
ReadlineLibrary.GnuReadline
ReadlineLibrary.Editline
ReadlineLibrary.Getline

Note that all programs using GnuReadline will fall under the GPL,
since Gnu-Readline is GPL software!
