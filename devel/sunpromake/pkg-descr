SunPro Make is a parallel make program from SUN Microsystems.
This package was derived from the SunPro Make sources from
OpenSolaris.  While the distributed make functionality has
never been open-sourced and is missing from this version of
SunPro Make, the parallel make functionality was succesfully
reconstructed from the present source.
