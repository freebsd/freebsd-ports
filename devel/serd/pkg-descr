Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading
and writing Turtle and NTriples.

Serd (and the included serdi tool) can be used to stream abbreviated
Turtle. Serd can serialise an unbounded amount of abbreviated
Turtle using a fixed amount of memory, and it does so very quickly.

Serd is written to the Turtle, NTriples and URI specifications, and
includes a comprehensive test suite which includes all the tests
from the Turtle specification.
