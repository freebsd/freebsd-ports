ConstantResolver resolves partially qualified constant reference to the fully
qualified name and the path of the file defining it. It does not load the files
to do that, its inference engine purely works on file paths and constant names.

ConstantResolver uses the same assumptions as Rails' code loader, Zeitwerk to
infer constant locations. Please see Zeitwerk's documentation on file structure
and inflection for more information.
