FncCheck is a library which generates profiles for C/C++ programs.
A profile is a list of informations about your functions, such as
time spend in functions, number of calls and other things.

In order to use FncCheck, you have to compile your .o files
with '-finstrument-functions -g' switches (gcc V2.95.2 and higher).
You have then to link your executable with the library 'libfnccheck.so'.
