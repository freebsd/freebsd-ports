Provides a publish-subscribe API to facilitate event-based or message-based
architecture in a single-process application. It is pure Python and works on
Python 3.3+. It is centered on the notion of a topic; senders publish messages
of a given topic, and listeners subscribe to messages of a given topic, all
inside the same process. The package also supports a variety of advanced
features that facilitate debugging and maintaining topics and messages in larger
desktop- or server-based applications.
