Pipenv -- the officially recommended Python packaging tool from Python.org, free
(as in freedom).

Pipenv is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler,
composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. Windows is a first-class
citizen, in our world.

It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as
adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages. It
also generates the ever-important Pipfile.lock, which is used to produce
deterministic builds.
