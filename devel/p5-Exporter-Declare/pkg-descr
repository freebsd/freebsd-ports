Exporter::Declare is a meta-driven exporting tool. Exporter::Declare
tries to adopt all the good features of other exporting tools, while
throwing away horrible interfaces. Exporter::Declare also provides
hooks that allow you to add options and arguments for import. Finally,
Exporter::Declare's meta-driven system allows for top-notch
introspection.
