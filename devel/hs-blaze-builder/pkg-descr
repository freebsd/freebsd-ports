This library provides an abstraction of buffered output of byte streams and
several convenience functions to exploit it. For example, it allows to
efficiently serialize Haskell values to lazy bytestrings with a large average
chunk size. The large average chunk size allows to make good use of cache
prefetching in later processing steps (e.g. compression) and reduces the sytem
call overhead when writing the resulting lazy bytestring to a file or sending
it over the network.
