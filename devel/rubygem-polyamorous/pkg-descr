Polyamorous is an extraction of shared code from the Active Record Hackery gems
Ransack, Squeel and MetaSearch by Ernie Miller and maintained by Ryan Bigg,
Xiang Li, Jon Atack and a great little group of contributors.

It is an internal library for extending various versions of Active Record with
polymorphism. There is no public API, so it's :nodoc:. Move along. Nothing to
see here.
