From the documentation:
 The kjbuckets module defines three data types for Python: kjSet,
 kjGraph, and kjDict. These types come with a number of associated
 methods, including common set theoretical operations such as union,
 intersection, difference, composition, transposition, reachability
 sets, and transitive closure.

 For suitably large compute intensive uses these types should provide
 up to an order of magnitude speedup versus an implementation that uses
 analogous operations implemented directly in Python.
