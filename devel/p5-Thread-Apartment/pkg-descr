Thread::Apartment provides an apartment threading wrapper
for Perl classes. "Apartment threading" is a method for
isolating an object (or object hierarchy) in its own thread,
and providing external interfaces via lightweight client
proxy objects. This approach is especially valuable in the
Perl threads environment, which doesn't provide a direct
means of passing complex, nested structure objects between
threads, and for non-threadsafe legacy object architectures,
e.g., Perl/Tk.

By using lightweight client proxy objects that implement the
Thread::Queue::Queueable interface, with Thread::Queue::Duplex
objects as the communication channel between client proxies
and apartment threads (or between threads in general), a more
thread-friendly OO environment is provided, ala Java, i.e.,
the ability to pass arbitrary objects between arbitrary threads.

Thread::Apartment is a fundamental component of the PSiCHE
framework (http://www.presicient.com/psiche).
