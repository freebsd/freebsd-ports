This package was originally the reference implementation for PEP 615,
which proposes support for the IANA time zone database in the standard
library, and now serves as a backport to Python 3.6+ (including PyPy).

This exposes the backports.zoneinfo module, which is a backport of the
zoneinfo module. The backport's documentation can be found on readthedocs.

The module uses the system time zone data if available, and falls back
to the tzdata package (available on PyPI) if installed.
