PCL-CVS is a front-end to CVS.  It integrates the most frequently
used CVS commands into emacs.

For VC users, PCL-CVS can be thought of as a VC-dired specially designed
for CVS.  PCL-CVS is not a replacement for VC and is supposed to interact
well with it.  It provides a global view of your project and allows
execution of cvs commands on several files at a time.
