File::ShareDir::PAR provides the same functionality as File::ShareDir but tries
hard to be compatible with PAR packaged applications.

The problem is, that the concept of having a distribution or module specific
share directory becomes a little hazy when you're loading everything from
a single file. PAR uses an @INC hook to intercept any attempt to load a module.
File::ShareDir uses the directory structure that is typically found in the
directories that are listed in @INC for storing the shared data. In a PAR
enviroment, this is not necessarily possible.

WARNING:
This module contains highly experimental code. If you want to load
modules from .par files using PAR and then access their shared directory
using File::ShareDir, you probably have no choice but to use it.
