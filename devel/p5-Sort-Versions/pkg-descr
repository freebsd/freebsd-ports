       Sort::Versions allows easy sorting of mixed non-numeric
       and numeric strings, like the "version numbers" that many
       shared library systems and revision control packages use.
       This is quite useful if you are trying to deal with shared
       libraries. It can also be applied to applications that
       intersperse variable-width numeric fields within text.
       Other applications can undoubtedly be found.

       For an explanation of the algorithm, it's simplest to look
       at these examples:

         1.1   <  1.2
         1.1a  <  1.2
         1.1   <  1.1.1
         1.1   <  1.1a
         1.1.a <  1.1a
         1     <  a
         a     <  b
         1     <  2
         1     <  0002
         1.5   <  1.06
