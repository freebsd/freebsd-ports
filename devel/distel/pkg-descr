Distel extends Emacs Lisp with Erlang-style processes and message
passing, and the Erlang distribution protocol. With this you can
write Emacs Lisp processes and have them communicate with normal
Erlang processes in real nodes. Includes some useful applications
(Dynamic TAGS, debugger, process list, profiler and more).
