LBPP is a front end to the GNU Common Compiler (GCC) that produces C
source code from Liberty Basic source code.  This code then is fed to
GCC to produce an executable.  It is similiar to C++ compilers that
produce C code that then is compiled.  It can be thought of either as
a GCC extension or a C translator.  The architecture of LBPP was
designed to allow statements to be added dynamically without requiring
a recompile of the source.  It accomplishes this by defining a
standard interface between C and Liberty Basic that allows C functions
to access all of the internal data of a Liberty Basic program.  The
fact that all of the functionality of is based in a C library, porting
LBPP to a new platform requires only porting the library to the native
GUI system along with necessary modifications to allow the code to
compile.  The translator should be ANSI C so porting should not be an
issue.
