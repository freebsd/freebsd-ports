While protocol buffers effectively guarantee the types of structured data, they
cannot enforce semantic rules for values. This package is a python
implementation of protoc-gen-validate, which allows for runtime validation of
various semantic assertions expressed as annotations on the protobuf schema. The
syntax for all available annotations is in validate.proto. Implemented Python
annotations are listed in the rules comparison.
