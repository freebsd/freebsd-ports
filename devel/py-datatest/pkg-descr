Datatest provides testing tools for data validation and analysis. It supports
both pytest and unittest style testing.

You can use datatest for validation, test driven data-wrangling, auditing,
logging discrepancies, and checklists for measuring progress. It encourages a
structured approach for checking and tidying data.
