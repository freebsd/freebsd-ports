Shader debugger lets you easily find bugs in your shader code. It is simple to
use - you just need to pause the preview and select the pixel that you want to
debug. After starting the debugger, you will be able to:
* step through your shader code line by line
* run immediate expressions
* add watches
* place (conditional) breakpoints
* see list of all variables and their values
* hover over expressions and see their value
