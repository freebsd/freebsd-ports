This module provides thread-safe FIFO queues that can be accessed safely
by any number of threads.

Any data types supported by threads::shared can be passed via queues:
- Ordinary scalars
- Array refs
- Hash refs
- Scalar refs
- Objects based on the above

Ordinary scalars are added to queues as they are.
