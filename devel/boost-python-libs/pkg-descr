The Boost Python Library is a framework for interfacing Python and
C++. It allows you to quickly and seamlessly expose C++ classes
functions and objects to Python, and vice-versa, using no special
tools -- just your C++ compiler.

The python 2 port is called boost-python-libs
The python 3 port is called boost-python3-libs
