PCRE2 is the name used for a revised API for the PCRE library, which is
a set of functions, written in C, that implement regular expression
pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl, with just
a few differences. Some features that appeared in Python and the
original PCRE before they appeared in Perl are also available using the
Python syntax. There is also some support for one or two .NET and
Oniguruma syntax items, and there are options for requesting some minor
changes that give better ECMAScript (aka JavaScript) compatibility.
