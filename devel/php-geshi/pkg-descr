GeSHi started as an idea to create a generic syntax highlighter
for the phpBB forum system, but has been generalised to this project.
GeSHi aims to be a simple but powerful highlighting class,
with the following goals:

 * Support for a wide range of popular languages
 * Easy to add a new language for highlighting
 * Highly customisable output formats
