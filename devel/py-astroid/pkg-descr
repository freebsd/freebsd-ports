The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of python
source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse, pylint... Well, actually
the development of this library is essentially governed by pylint's needs. It
used to be called logilab-astng.

It provides a compatible representation which comes from the _ast module. It
rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by recursively walking
down the AST and building an extended ast. The new node classes have additional
methods and attributes for different usages. They include some support for
static inference and local name scopes. Furthermore, astroid builds partial
trees by inspecting living objects.
