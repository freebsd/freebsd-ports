The libopencm3 project aims to create an open-source firmware library for
various ARM Cortex-M3 microcontrollers.

Currently (at least partly) supported microcontrollers:

 - ST STM32F1 series
 - ST STM32F2 series
 - ST STM32F4 series
 - NXP LPC1311/13/42/43

The library is written completely from scratch based on the vendor datasheets,
programming manuals, and application notes. The code is meant to be used
with a GCC toolchain for ARM (arm-elf or arm-none-eabi), flashing of the
code to a microcontroller can be done using the OpenOCD ARM JTAG software.

This port depends on devel/gcc-arm-embedded toolchain.
