This package provides semi-portable access to hardware provided atomic memory
operations.  These might allow you to write code:

  - That does more interesting things in signal handlers
  - Makes more effective use of multiprocessors by allowing you to write
    clever lock-free code.  Note that such code is very difficult to get
    right, and will unavoidably be less portable than lock-based code.  It
    is also not always faster than lock-based code.  But it may occasionally
    be a large performance win
  - To experiment with new and much better thread programming paradigms, etc.
