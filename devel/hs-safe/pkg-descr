A library wrapping Prelude/Data.List functions that can throw exceptions,
such as head and !!.

This package is divided into three modules:

 * Safe contains safe variants of Prelude and Data.List functions.
 * Safe.Foldable contains safe variants of Foldable functions.
 * Safe.Exact creates crashing versions of functions like zip (errors if the
   lists are not equal) and take (errors if there are not enough elements),
   then wraps them to provide safe variants.
