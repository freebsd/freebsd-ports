GH - Layered GitHub API client

This is a highly flexible, layered, low-level GitHub client library, trying to
get out of your way and let you get to the GitHub data as simple as possible.
Unless you add layers, you will end up with Hashes and Arrays. The approach and
API should be familiar from projects like Rack or Faraday.
