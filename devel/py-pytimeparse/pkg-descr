The single function pytimeparse.timeparse.timeparse, defined in the library,
(also available as pytimeparse.parse) parses time expressions like the following:

32m
2h32m
3d2h32m
1w3d2h32m

...

It returns the time as a number of seconds (an integer value if possible, otherwise a floating-point number):

>>> from pytimeparse import parse
>>> parse('1.2 minutes')
72
