This class may be used for sending email messages for Subversion repos-
itory activity.  There are a number of different modes supported, and
SVN::Notify is fully subclassable, to easily add new functionality.  By
default, a list of all the files affected by the commit will be assem-
bled and listed in a single message.  An additional option allows diffs
to be calculated for the changes and either appended to the message or
added as an attachment.
