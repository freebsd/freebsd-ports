Pegex is an Acmeist parser framework. It allows you to easily create parsers
that will work equivalently in lots of programming languages! The inspiration
for Pegex comes from the parsing engine upon which the postmodern programming
language Perl 6 is based on. Pegex brings this beauty to the other justmodern
languages that have a normal regular expression engine available.

Pegex gets it name by combining Parsing Expression Grammars (PEG), with Regular
Expessions (Regex). That's actually what Pegex does.

PEG is the cool new way to elegantly specify recursive descent grammars. The
Perl 6 language is defined in terms of a self modifying PEG language called Perl
6 Rules. Regexes are familiar to programmers of most modern programming
languages. Pegex defines a simple PEG syntax, where all the terminals are
regexes. This means that Pegex can be quite fast and powerful.

Pegex attempts to be the simplest way to define new (or old) Domain Specific
Languages (DSLs) that need to be used in several programming languages and
environments. Things like JSON, YAML, Markdown etc. It also great for writing
parsers/compilers that only need to work in one language.
