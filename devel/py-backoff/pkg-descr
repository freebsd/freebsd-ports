The backoff Python module provides function decorators which can be used to wrap
a function such that it will be retried until some condition is met. It is meant
to be of use when accessing unreliable resources with the potential for
intermittent failures i.e. network resources and external APIs. Somewhat more
generally, it may also be of use for dynamically polling resources for
externally generated content.
