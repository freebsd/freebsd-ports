Ouch provides a class for exception handling that doesn't require a
lot of boilerplate, nor any up front definition.  If Exception::Class
is working for you, great! But if you want something that is faster,
easier to use, requires less typing, and has no prereqs, but still
gives you much of that same functionality, then Ouch is for you.
