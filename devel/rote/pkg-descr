ROTE is a simple C library for VT102 terminal emulation.  It allows the
programmer to set up virtual 'screens' and send them data.  The virtual
screens will emulate the behavior of a VT102 terminal, interpreting escape
sequences, control characters and such.  The library supports ncurses as
well so that you may render the virtual screen to the real screen when you
need to.
