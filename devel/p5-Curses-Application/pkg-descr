Curses::Application is designed to provide a flexible framework for rapid
application development of Curses-based console applications in Perl. Based
on Curses::Widgets and Curses::Forms, Curses::Application provides a flexible
OO framework to manage forms, widgets, and dialogs, without (hopefully) ever
having to deal directly with Curses calls.
