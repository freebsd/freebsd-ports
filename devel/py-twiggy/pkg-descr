Twiggy is a Pythonic logger.

As near as I can tell, Twiggy is the first totally new design for a logger
since log4j was developed in 1996. Let me say that again: Twiggy is the first
new logger in 15 years.

Twiggy:

  * Uses new-style format strings by default. Way nicer than %s (printf).
  * Includes easy support for structured logging
  * Loosely couples loggers and outputs for configuration
  * Supports asynchronous logging using the multiprocessing module
  * Solves Your Problems. Pets Your Puppy.
