trailrunner is a simple library for walking paths on the filesystem, and
executing functions for each file found. trailrunner obeys project level
.gitignore files, and runs functions on a process pool for increased
performance. trailrunner is designed for use by linting, formatting, and other
developer tools that need to find and operate on all files in project in a
predictable fashion with a minimal API.
