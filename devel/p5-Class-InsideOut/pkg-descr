This is a simple, safe and streamlined toolkit for building inside-out
objects. Unlike most other inside-out object building modules already
on CPAN, this module aims for minimalism and robustness:

    * Does not require derived classes to subclass it
    * Uses no source filters, attributes or CHECK blocks
    * Supports any underlying object type including foreign inheritance
    * Does not leak memory on object destruction
    * Overloading-safe
    * Thread-safe for Perl 5.8 or better
    * mod_perl compatible
    * Makes no assumption about inheritance or initializer needs

It provides the minimal support necessary for creating safe inside-out
objects and generating flexible accessors.
