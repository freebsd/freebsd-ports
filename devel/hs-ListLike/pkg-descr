Generic support for list-like structures in Haskell.

The ListLike module provides a common interface to the various Haskell types
that are list-like. Predefined interfaces include standard Haskell lists,
Arrays, ByteStrings, and lazy ByteStrings. Custom types can easily be made
ListLike instances as well.

ListLike also provides for String-like types, such as String and ByteString,
for types that support input and output, and for types that can handle
infinite lists.
