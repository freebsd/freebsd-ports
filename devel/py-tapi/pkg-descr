Tapi is a tool to automate the testing of your Application Programmer Interfaces
(APIs).  Features:

- Test you API without writing any code (only edit a json file)
- Test you APIs in a much more 'natural' way by specifying urls/verbs and what
  the output should be
- Verify anything from response status codes, headers, body content etc
- Also allows verification by issuing another API call to a different endpoint
  to ensure a prior API call worked
- Execute arbitrary python scripts to populate request paramaters e.g. custom
  headers
- Execute arbitrary python scripts to verify response from endpoint is valid
- Tests your APIs using your own APIs
