GitHub CLI brings GitHub to your terminal.

It reduces context switching, helps you focus, and enables
you to more easily script and create your own workflows.

It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts
to the terminal next to where you are already working with
git and your code.

The release version supports GitHub Enterprise Server in
addition to GitHub.com.
