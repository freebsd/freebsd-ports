This module is an interface to the C Clustering Library, a general
purpose library implementing functions for hierarchical clustering
(pairwise simple, complete, average, and centroid linkage),
along with k-means and k-medians clustering, and 2D self-organizing maps.
The library is distributed along with Cluster 3.0, an enhanced version
of the famous Cluster program originally written by Michael Eisen
while at Stanford University. The C clustering library was written
by Michiel de Hoon.

This module is a Perl wrapper for the C clustering library for
cDNA microarray data, Copyright (C) 2002 Michiel Jan Laurens de Hoon.
