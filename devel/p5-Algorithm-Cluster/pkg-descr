This module is an interface to the C Clustering Library, a general 
purpose library implementing functions for hierarchical clustering 
(pairwise simple, complete, average, and centroid linkage), 
along with k-means and k-medians clustering, and 2D self-organizing maps. 
The library is distributed along with Cluster 3.0, an enhanced version 
of the famous Cluster program originally written by Michael Eisen 
while at Stanford University. The C clustering library was written 
by Michiel de Hoon.

This module is a Perl wrapper for the C clustering library for 
cDNA microarray data, Copyright (C) 2002 Michiel Jan Laurens de Hoon.
