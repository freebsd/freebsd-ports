Nuxi CloudABI is an application binary interface for UNIX-like operating
systems built around the concept of capability-based security. In a
nutshell, it means that you can run processes directly on top of a UNIX
kernel while keeping complete control over the actions the process is
allowed to perform.

This port installs a set of header files that contain the definitions
that describe the ABI itself: all of the constants, types, structures
and system calls.
