The PEAR::HTML_Page2 package provides a simple interface for generating an
XHTML compliant page:
  * supports virtually all HTML doctypes, from HTML 2.0 through XHTML 1.1 and
    XHTML Basic 1.0 plus preliminary support for XHTML 2.0
  * namespace support
  * global language declaration for the document
  * line ending styles
  * full META tag support
  * support for stylesheet declaration in the head section
  * support for script declaration in the head section
  * support for linked stylesheets and scripts
  * full support for header link tags
  * body can be a string, object with toHtml or toString methods or an array
    (can be combined)

Ideas for use:
  * Use to validate the output of a class for XHTML compliance
  * Quick prototyping using PEAR packages is now a breeze.
