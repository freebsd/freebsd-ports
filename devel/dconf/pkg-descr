GConf extends the concept of a configuration registry.  It provides
a simple way for applications and administrators to store data;
often GConf is used to store preferences for applications.

Some of the features of GConf are:
GConf provides:

    * Documentation for each configuration key, so that administrators
      can better modify the value.

    * Notifications to interested applications when configuration data
      is changed.  The notification service works across networks,
      affecting all login sessions for a single user.

    * Proper locking so that configuration data doesn't get corrupted
      when accessed by multiple applications at the same time.
