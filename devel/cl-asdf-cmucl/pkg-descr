asdf is Another System Definition Facility for Common Lisp. It intends
to solve the same class of problems as mk-defsystem - compiling and
installing Lisp libraries -, but internally it takes advantage of
modern CL features like pathname support etc., and uses CLOS for
extensibility.

This package installs binaries compiled for CMU Common Lisp.
