Simple command line runner on top of python-daemon, a library which implements
the well-behaved daemon specification of PEP 3143, ???Standard daemon process
library.

A well-behaved Unix daemon process is tricky to get right, but the required
steps are much the same for every daemon program. A DaemonContext instance
holds the behaviour and configured process environment for the program; use
the instance as a context manager to enter a daemon state.

Simple example of usage:

import daemon

from spam import do_main_program

with daemon.DaemonContext():
    do_main_program()

Customisation of the steps to become a daemon is available by setting options
on the DaemonContext instance; see the documentation for that class for each
option.
