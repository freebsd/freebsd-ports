Blessings lifts several of curses' limiting assumptions, and it makes
your code pretty

Use styles, color, and maybe a little positioning without necessarily
clearing the whole screen first.  Leave more than one screenful of
scrollback in the buffer after your program exits, like a well-behaved
command-line app should.  Get rid of all those noisy, C-like calls to
tigetstr and tparm, so your code doesn't get crowded out by terminal
bookkeeping.  Act intelligently when somebody redirects your output to a
file, omitting the terminal control codes the user doesn't want to see.
