This library provides C++11 bindings/wrapper over a subset of SDL2
functions with extra features proided with modern C++ such as:

* RAII-style initialization and destruction
* Full error checking: exception is thrown if any SDL function
  fails. Exception itself allows to retrieve SDL error string
* C++11 move semantics support, which allow you to store SDL objects
  in containers and pass/return them by value with no overhead
