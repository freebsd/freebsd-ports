Dir::Project provides a way to locate a source-controlled directory
(CVS, Subversion, Perforce, etc) using only the current working
directory (cd). This prevents users from having to set other
environment variables when they switch between areas, and allows
scripts and such inside the directory to be executed without changing
the user's PATH.
