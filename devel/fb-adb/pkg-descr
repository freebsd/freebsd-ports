fb-adb is a tool for interacting with Android systems. It does much of
what adb does, but with better remote shell support and, hopefully,
fewer bugs. Differences between adb and fb-adb are that fb-adb:

  * is binary clean (no LF -> CRLF mangling)
  * transmits and updates window size
  * distinguishes standard output and standard error
  * properly muxes streams with independent flow control
  * allows for ssh-like pty allocation control
  * propagates program exit status instead of always exiting
    with status 0
  * properly escapes program arguments
  * kills remote program
  * provides a generic facility to elevate to root without re-escaping
