Test::DependentModules is intended as a tool for module authors who would like
to easily test that a module release will not break dependencies. This is
particularly useful for module authors (like myself) who have modules which are
a dependency of many other modules.

WARNING: The tests this module does should *NEVER* be included as part of a
normal CPAN install!
