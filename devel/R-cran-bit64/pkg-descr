Package 'bit64' provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed)
integers that can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames.
Methods are available for coercion from and to logicals, integers,
doubles, characters and factors as well as many elementwise and
summary functions. Many fast algorithmic operations such as 'match'
and 'order' support interactive data exploration and manipulation
and optionally leverage caching.
