Connexion is a modern Python web framework that makes spec-first and api-first
development easy. You describe your API in an OpenAPI (or Swagger) specification
with as much detail as you want and Connexion will guarantee that it works as
you specified.

It works either standalone, or in combination with any ASGI or WSGI-compatible
framework.
