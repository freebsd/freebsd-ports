sse2neon is a translator of Intel SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions)
intrinsics to Arm NEON, shortening the time needed to get an Arm working
program that then can be used to extract profiles and to identify hot
paths in the code. The header file sse2neon.h contains several of the
functions provided by Intel intrinsic headers such as <xmmintrin.h>,
only implemented with NEON-based counterparts to produce the exact
semantics of the intrinsics.
