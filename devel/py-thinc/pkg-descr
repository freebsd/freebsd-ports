Thinc is a lightweight deep learning library that offers an elegant,
type-checked, functional-programming API for composing models, with support for
layers defined in other frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow and MXNet. You
can use Thinc as an interface layer, a standalone toolkit or a flexible way to
develop new models. Previous versions of Thinc have been running quietly in
production in thousands of companies, via both spaCy and Prodigy.
