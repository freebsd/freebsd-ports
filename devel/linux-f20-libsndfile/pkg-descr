libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing sound files such as
AIFF, AU, WAV, and others through one standard interface. It can
currently read/write 8, 16, 24 and 32-bit PCM files as well as 32 and
64-bit floating point WAV files and a number of compressed formats. It
compiles and runs on *nix, MacOS, and Win32.

Brought in from Fedora 20.
