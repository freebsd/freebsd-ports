QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of closed and open
quantum systems. The QuTiP library depends on the excellent Numpy, Scipy, and
Cython numerical packages. In addition, graphical output is provided by
Matplotlib. QuTiP aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical
simulations of a wide variety of quantum mechanical problems, including those
with Hamiltonians and/or collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence,
commonly found in a wide range of physics applications. QuTiP is freely
available for use and/or modification on all common platforms. Being free of
any licensing fees, QuTiP is ideal for exploring quantum mechanics in research
as well as in the classroom.
