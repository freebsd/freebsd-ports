Poslib is a portable C++ DNS library, a part of Posadis project.
It consists of two parts: a client library and a server library.

Using the client library, you can simply develop applications that use
the Domain Name System (DNS). It includes many functions for resolving,
domain-name manipulation and Resource Record (RR) creation.

The server library, based on the client core, can be used to develop
DNS servers. By implementing a query entry-point function using the
Poslib library of functions, you can easily create DNS servers,
without worrying about low-level details such as DNS message compilation,
domain-name compression and UDP/TCP transmission.
