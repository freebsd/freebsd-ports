pycount helps you with a simple analysis of Python code, categorizing it into
comments, doc strings, blank lines and real code. It creates simple lines
counts for individual or multiple files, but can also be used to strip
comments from a source file, say. See a sample output of pycount running on
itself in verbose mode.
