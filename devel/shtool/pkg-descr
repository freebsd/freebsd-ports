shtool -- Portable Shell Tool
Copyright (c) 1994-1999 Ralf S. Engelschall, All rights reserved.

This is a compilation of small but very stable and portable shell scripts
into a single shell tool. All ingredients were in successful use over many
years in various Open Source projects. The compiled shtool program is
intended to be used inside the source tree of Open Source packages.  There it
can overtake various (usually non-portable) tasks related to the building and
installation of an Open Source package.
