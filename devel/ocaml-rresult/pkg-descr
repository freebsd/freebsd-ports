This library defines cominators to operate on the standard Result type
(introduced in OCaml 4.03). Using Result as return type of a
computation that can fail forces explicit handling of error, as oposed
to e.g. raising an exception.

As the author puts it: "OCaml 4.08 provides the Stdlib.Result module
which you should prefer to Rresult."
