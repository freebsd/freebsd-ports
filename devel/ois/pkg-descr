Object Oriented Input System (OIS) is meant to be a cross platform,
simple solution for using all kinds of Input Devices (KeyBoards,
Mice, Joysticks, etc) and feedback devices (e.g. forcefeedback).
Written in C++ using Object Oriented Design patterns.

NOTE: this ports lacks joystick support. For now.
