HPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for
parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a
unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources
to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability. This library strictly adheres to
the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to
use, highly optimized, and very portable. HPX is developed for conventional
architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q,
as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.
