Tenacity is an Apache 2.0 licensed general-purpose retrying library, written in
Python, to simplify the task of adding retry behavior to just about anything. It
originates from a fork of retrying which is sadly no longer maintained. Tenacity
isn't api compatible with retrying but adds significant new functionality and
fixes a number of longstanding bugs.
