Config::JFDI is an implementation of Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader
that exists outside of Catalyst.

Essentially, Config::JFDI will scan a directory for files matching a
certain name. If such a file is found which also matches an extension
that Config::Any can read, then the configuration from that file will
be loaded.
