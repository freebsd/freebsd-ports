Per Conor McBride, the Newtype typeclass represents the packing and unpacking
of a newtype, and allows you to operatate under that newtype with functions
such as ala. Generics support was added in version 0.4, making this package a
full replacement for the original newtype package, and a better alternative to
newtype-th.
