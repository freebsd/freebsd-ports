JE is a pure-Perl ECMAScript (JavaScript) engine that seamlessly
integrates JavaScript's dynamic capabilities into Perl projects. It
stands out for its compatibility with serialization tools, allowing the
runtime environment to be easily serialized. The engine is highly
customizable, with a parser that can be tailored to support a wide range
of language features according to project needs. Additionally, JE offers
direct manipulation of JavaScript datatypes from Perl, utilizing
overloaded operators for a smooth interoperability. This feature set
makes JE particularly useful for developers looking to enhance their
Perl applications with JavaScript functionality, providing a bridge
between the two languages' ecosystems.
