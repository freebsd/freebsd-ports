Kwiki is perhaps the simplest, most modular and easy to extend wiki. A wiki
allows users to freely create and edit web pages in any web browser. Kwiki
is Open Source Software and is available on CPAN.

The overall design goal of CGI::Kwiki is simplicity and extensibility.
Even so, Kwiki will have some killer built in features not available in
most wikis:

    * KwikiSlideShow
    * KwikiBlog
    * KwikiSisters
    * KwikiHotKeys
    * KwikiFit
    * KwikiPod
    * KwikiPrivacy

Each feature is implemented as a separate plugin class. This keeps things
simple and extensible.
