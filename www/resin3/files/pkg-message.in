Resin is now installed in %%APP_HOME%%

You may want to activate it in /etc/rc.conf:

%%APP_NAME%%_enable="YES"

Then start it:

env - %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/%%APP_NAME%% start

For this control script to run seamlessly, it is recommended to increase the
maximum length of commands displayed by ps(1).  Please append the following
setting to /etc/sysctl.conf:

  # Do not truncate command line arguments in ps(1) listing
  kern.ps_arg_cache_limit=10000

This setting will take effect at next reboot, however it is possible to have
immediate effect with the following command as root:

  # sysctl kern.ps_arg_cache_limit=10000

If you wish to skip this setting, please note that the `stop', `restart' and
`status' will not function properly with %%APP_NAME%%.sh.

Once Resin is started, point your web browser to the default home page at
http://localhost:%%PORT%%/ to read the documentation and test the samples.

Resin configuration is located at %%PREFIX%%/etc/%%APP_NAME%%/resin.xml
Enjoy!
