Python Paste brings consistency to Python web development and web
application installation, providing tools for both developers and
system administrators.

These provide several pieces of "middleware" (or filters) that can be
nested to build web applications. Each piece of middleware uses the
WSGI (PEP 333) interface, and should be compatible with other
middleware based on those interfaces.
