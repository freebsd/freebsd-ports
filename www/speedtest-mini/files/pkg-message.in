Speedtest Mini has been installed into:

     %%WWWDIR%%

Please edit php.ini to suit your needs.

To make speedtest available through your web site, I suggest
that you add something like the following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /speedtest/ "%%WWWDIR%%/"

    <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%/">
	Options none
	DirectoryIndex index.html
	AllowOverride All

	Order Deny,Allow
	Deny from all
	Allow from 127.0.0.1 .example.com
    </Directory>
