Please edit php.ini to suit your needs.

To make speedtest available through your web site, I suggest
that you add something like the following to httpd.conf:

    Alias /speedtest/ "/usr/local/www/speedtest-mini/"

    <Directory "/usr/local/www/speedtest-mini/">
	Options none
	DirectoryIndex index.html
	AllowOverride All
	
	Order Deny,Allow
	Deny from all
	Allow from 127.0.0.1 .example.com
    </Directory>
