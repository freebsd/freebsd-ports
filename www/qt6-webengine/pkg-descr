The Qt WebEngine module provides a web browser engine that makes it easy to
embed content from the World Wide Web into your Qt application on platforms
that do not have a native web engine.

Qt WebEngine provides C++ classes and QML types for rendering HTML, XHTML, and
SVG documents, styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripted with
JavaScript. HTML documents can be made fully editable by the user through the
use of the contenteditable attribute on HTML elements.
