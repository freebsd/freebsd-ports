With Speed Dial, you can easily access your most used websites. To
show the Speed Dial tab, use the Speed Dial button (which can be added
to the toolbar), or enter "chrome://speeddial/content" in your
location bar.

Speed Dial will be automatically loaded in blank new windows.  It can
also load in blank new tabs. To configure this, and other options, use
the extension settings panel.

To assign one website to Speed Dial, use the new "Set as Speed Dial"
option in the bookmarks menu, or right click on the tab you want to
add, and choose "Set as Speed Dial". That option is also available in
the contextual area menu.
