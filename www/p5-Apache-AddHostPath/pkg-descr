Apache::AddHostPath is a perl module that can transform a requested URI based
on the hostname and port number from the http request header.  It allows you
to manage an arbitrary number of domains/subdomains all pointed at the same
document root, but for which you want a combination of shared and distinct
files.  Essentially, the module implements Apache's URI translation phase by
attempting to use some or all of the URL hostname and port number as the base
of the URI.  It simply does file and directory existence tests on a series
of URIs (from most-specific to least-specific) and sets the URI to the
most specific match.
