A Python utilities collection for building WSGI applications.

Werkzeug does not try to be a framework, and instead started as a simple
collection of various utilities useful for building WSGI applications.
It has since become one of the most advanced collections of its kind.

It includes a powerful debugger, fully featured request and response
objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control headers,
HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL routing
system and a bunch of community contributed add-on modules.
