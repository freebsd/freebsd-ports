HTTPX is a full featured Python HTTP library with both sync and async APIs
designed to be a next generation HTTP client for Python. This library is a
port of Requests GSSAPI to HTTPX which adds optional GSSAPI authentication
support and supports mutual authentication.

Basic GET usage:

>>> import httpx
>>> from httpx_gssapi import HTTPSPNEGOAuth
>>> r = httpx.get("http://example.org", auth=HTTPSPNEGOAuth())

Both the sync and async HTTPX APIs should be fully supported.
