POST-INSTALL CONFIGURATION FOR MAHARA
=====================================

1) Create a user and a database for MAHARA to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   ### For Apache earlier than 2.4.

   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%MAHARADIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%MAHARADIR%%/>
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
   </Directory>

3) Make sure that magic_quotes_gpc is off and register_globals is off
in your PHP.ini file.

4) Change into the directory %%PREFIX%%/%%MAHARADIR%% and copy the
file config-dist.php to config.php, then go through the file and make
changes where appropriate.

5) Now you can navigate to the Mahara website using your web browser.
Log into the system with user "admin", password "mahara".
