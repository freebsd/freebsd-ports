eAccelerator is a free open-source PHP accelerator & optimizer. It increases
the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in their compiled state, so
that the overhead of compiling is almost completely eliminated. It also
optimizes scripts to speed up their execution. eAccelerator typically reduces
server load and increases the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.
