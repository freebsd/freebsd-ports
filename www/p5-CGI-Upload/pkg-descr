This module has been written to provide a simple and secure
manner by which to handle files uploaded in multipart/form-data
requests through a web browser. The primary advantage which this
module offers over existing modules is the single interface
which it provides for the most often required information
regarding files uploaded in this manner.

This module builds upon primarily the CGI and File::MMagic
modules and offers some tidy and succinct methods for the
handling of files uploaded via multipart/form-data requests.
