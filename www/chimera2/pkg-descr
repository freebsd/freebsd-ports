Chimera is a program which allows a user to access World-Wide Web servers
and other information servers.  It presents the user with a point-and-click
graphical interface using the X Window System and the Athena Widgets.

While it does NOT do Frames, Java, JavaScript, or even embedded Tcl
(yet at least), it *is* designed to be ``Wilbur'' (HTML v3.2) compliant,
and handles .gif, .jpg and quite a number of other image formats
internally.  Yet image handling is a little odd, as compared to other
browsers.  Each image is *often* surrounded by scrollbars, rather than
being resized to a specified size.  Hence it makes a good visual tool
for proper sizing information.

THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION - so don't be surprised if something doesn't
properly work OTOH, it *does* do tables and forms, and multiple windows.

Unlike version 1.65 previously distributed, it is an all-in-one binary
and depends upon X- resources settings for configuration.  It may
be touchy about interrupted image fetches, or other things, as well.
Each user is expected to create a ~/.chimera subdirectory for 
bookmarks and personal preferences, and a ~/.chimera/cache (which may
be a symlink to somewhere else).
