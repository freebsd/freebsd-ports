django-ldapdb is an LDAP database backend for Django. It allows one to
manipulate LDAP entries using Django's models.

Declaring models using the LDAP backend is very staightforward, one simply
inherit from ldapdb.models.Model and declare the fields in the same way as for
regular models. One can even edit the LDAP entries using Django's admin
interface.
