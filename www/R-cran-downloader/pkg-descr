Provides a wrapper for the download.file function, making it possible
to download files over HTTPS on Windows, Mac OS X, and other Unix-like
platforms. The 'RCurl' package provides this functionality (and
much more) but can be difficult to install because it must be
compiled with external dependencies. This package has no external
dependencies, so it is much easier to install.
