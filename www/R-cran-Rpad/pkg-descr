Rpad is an interactive, web-based analysis program. Rpad pages are
interactive workbook-type sheets based on R, an open-source
implementation of the S language. Rpad is an analysis package, a
web-page designer, and a gui designer all wrapped in one. Rpad makes
it easy to develop powerful data analysis applications that can be
shared with others (most likely on an intranet). The user doesn't
have to install anything--everything's done through a browser.
