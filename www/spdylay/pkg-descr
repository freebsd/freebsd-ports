Spdylay - SPDY C Library

This is an experimental implementation of Google's SPDY protocol in C. This
library provides SPDY version 2 and 3 framing layer implementation. It does not
perform any I/O operations. When the library needs them, it calls the callback
functions provided by the application. It also does not include any event
polling mechanism, so the application can freely choose the way of handling
events. This library code does not depend on any particular SSL library (except
for example programs which depend on OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later).

This project also develops SPDY client, server and proxy on top of Spdylay
library.
