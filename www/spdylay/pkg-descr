Spdylay - SPDY C Library

This is an experimental implementation of Google's SPDY protocol in C. This
library provides SPDY version 2, 3 and 3.1 framing layer implementation. It does
not perform any I/O operations. When the library needs them, it calls the
callback functions provided by the application. It also does not include any
event polling mechanism, so the application can freely choose the way of
handling events. This library code does not depend on any particular SSL library
(except for example programs which depend on OpenSSL 1.0.1 or later).

This project also develops SPDY client, server and proxy on top of Spdylay
library.
