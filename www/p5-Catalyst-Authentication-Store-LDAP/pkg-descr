This plugin implements the Catalyst::Authentication v.10 API.

This plugin uses Net::LDAP to let your application authenticate against
an LDAP directory.  It has a pretty high degree of flexibility, given
the wide variation of LDAP directories and schemas from one system to
another.

It authenticates users in two steps:

1) A search of the directory is performed, looking for a user object
that matches the username you pass.  This is done with the bind
credentials supplied in the "binddn" and "bindpw" configuration options.

2) If that object is found, we then re-bind to the directory as that
object.  Assuming this is successful, the user is Authenticated.
