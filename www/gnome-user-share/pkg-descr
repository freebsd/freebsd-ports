gnome-user-share is a small package that binds together various free
software projects to bring easy to use user-level file sharing to the
masses.

The program is meant to run in the background when the user is logged
in, and when file sharing is enabled a webdav server is started that
shares the $HOME/Public folder. The share is then published to all
computers on the local network using mDNS/rendezvous, so that it shows
up in the Network location in Gnome.
