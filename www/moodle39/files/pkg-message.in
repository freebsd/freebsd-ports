1) Create a user and a database for Moodle to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).
   It doesn't matter what the database or user names are,
   as this will be configured in a later step.
   NOTE: this package assumes that either the phpX-pgsql,
   phpX-mysql, or phpX-mssql packages are installed.

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration file
   httpd.conf, and restart the server:

   Alias /moodle %%PREFIX%%/%%MOODLEDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%MOODLEDIR%%/>
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
   </Directory>

3) Visit your Moodle site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/moodle/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up Moodle, creating an admin account, etc.

   At one step, you will get a message saying that the
   installer script was not able to automatically create
   the config.php file. Just download it and copy it to
   %%PREFIX%%/%%MOODLEDIR%%/config.php. Beware that it
   will contain the database password in cleartext, so
   set up whatever file permissions you deem more adequate.
   For instance, user=root, group=www, mask=640.

4) Set up a cron task to invoke the file admin/cron.php
   every five minutes or so. For instance:
   */5 * * * * fetch http://your.server.com/moodle/admin/cron.php

For more information, see the INSTALL DOCUMENTATION:

   http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle

It may be worth reading the installation docs even if Moodle seems
to be working at first, to ensure your PHP settings and database
configuration will allow Moodle to operate properly.
