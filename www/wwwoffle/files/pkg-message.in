If you are upgrading from an old version of wwwoffle, you may need to
convert the cache directory structure to work with the new version.  You
can find programs in the WWWOFFLE distribution tarball to do this, along
with instructions about what is needed.  A more common requirement is to
run the `upgrade-config.pl' script, so you will find a copy of this in
%%WWWOFFLE_SPOOL%%/upgrade-config.pl.  You should run this on your
configuration file, e.g.:

     $ perl %%WWWOFFLE_SPOOL%%/upgrade-config.pl \
            %%PREFIX%%/etc/wwwoffle.conf
