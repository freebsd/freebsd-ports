For a quick Guacamole setup and test:
	Guacamole-client requires authentication to start.
	cp %%ETCDIR%%/user-mapping.xml.sample \
	%%ETCDIR%%/user-mapping.xml

	Once tomcat8 and guacd are running
	http://localhost:8080/guacamole

For upgrading guacamole, this is a reminder to upgrade
the auth-extensions. (and database if jdbc is used)
