guacamole-client is the superproject containing all Maven-based
projects that make Guacamole, an HTML5 web application that provides
access to your desktop using remote desktop protocols.

guacamole-client is used to build the subprojects that make up
Guacamole, and to provide a common central repository. Each project
contained here is completely independent of guacamole-client and
can be built separately, though the others may have to be built
first. If all projects are built using guacamole-client, Maven will
take care of the proper build order.
