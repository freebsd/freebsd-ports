Graphite is a highly scalable real-time graphing system. As a user,
you write an application that collects numeric time-series data that
you are interested in graphing, and send it to Graphite's processing
backend, carbon, which stores the data in Graphite's specialized
database. The data can then be visualized through graphite's web
interfaces.
