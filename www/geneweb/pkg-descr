GeneWeb is a genealogy software program with a Web interface
originally developed by Daniel de Rauglaudre, but currently
maintained by fabien@geneanet.org. It can be used off-line
or in a Web environment. It uses very efficient techniques
of relationship and consanguinity computing, developed in
collaboration with Didier Remy, research Director at INRIA.

Feel free to enable option GTK2 to try the new GUI. It's
only disabled by default to avoid accidental GTK2 dependencies.
