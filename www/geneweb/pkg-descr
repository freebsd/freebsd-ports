GeneWeb is a genealogy software program with a Web interface
originally developed by Daniel de Rauglaudre, but currently
maintained by fabien@geneanet.org. It can be used off-line
or in a Web environment. It uses very efficient techniques
of relationship and consanguinity computing, developed in
collaboration with Didier Remy, research Director at INRIA.
