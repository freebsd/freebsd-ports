aiobreaker is a Python implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern, described
in Michael T. Nygard's book Release It!.

Circuit breakers exist to allow one subsystem to fail without destroying the
entire system. This is done by wrapping dangerous operations (typically
integration points) with a component that can circumvent calls when the system
is not healthy.
