HTML::GenToc generates anchors and a table of contents for
HTML documents.  Depending on the arguments, it will insert
the information it generates, or output to a string, a separate file
or STDOUT.

While it defaults to taking H1 and H2 elements as the significant
elements to put into the table of contents, any tag can be defined
as a significant element.  Also, it doesn't matter if the input
HTML code is complete, pure HTML, one can input pseudo-html
or page-fragments, which makes it suitable for using on templates
and HTML meta-languages such as WML.

Also included in the distrubution is hypertoc, a script which uses the
module so that one can process files on the command-line in a
user-friendly manner.
