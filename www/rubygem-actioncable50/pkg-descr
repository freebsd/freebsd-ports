Action Cable â€“ Integrated WebSockets for Rails

Action Cable seamlessly integrates WebSockets with the rest of your Rails
application. It allows for real-time features to be written in Ruby in the same
style and form as the rest of your Rails application, while still being
performant and scalable. It's a full-stack offering that provides both a
client-side JavaScript framework and a server-side Ruby framework. You have
access to your full domain model written with Active Record or your ORM of
choice.
