Services_GeoNames is a PHP5 interface to the various webservices
offered by the GeoNames project.

The GeoNames database contains over 8,000,000 geographical names
corresponding to over 6,500,000 unique features. All features are
categorized into one out of nine feature classes and further
subcategorized into one out of 645 feature codes. Beyond names of
places in various languages, data stored include latitude, longitude,
elevation, population, administrative subdivision and postal codes.
All coordinates use the WGS84 system (World Geodetic System 1984).

Those data are accessible free of charge through a number of Web
services and a daily database export. The Web services include
direct and reverse geocoding,finding places through postal codes,
finding places next to a given place, and finding Wikipedia articles
about neighbouring places.
