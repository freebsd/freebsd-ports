Plugger is a multimedia plugin for Unix Netscape 3.0 or later that
handles Quicktime, MPEG, MP2, AVI, SGI-movie, Tiff, DL, IFF-anim,
MIDI, Soundtracker, AU, WAV and Commodore 64 audio files. Since
Plugger 3.0, MPEG audio and video can be streamed.

Plugger is a very small plugin, because plugger uses external programs
to show/play the different formats.
