The goal of this project is to create a new way of writing Django template tags
which is fully compatible with the current Django templating infrastructure.
This new way should be easy, clean and require as little boilerplate code as
possible while still staying as powerful as possible. Some features:
- Class based template tags.
- Template tag argument parser.
- Declarative way to define arguments.
- Supports (theoretically infinite) parse-until blocks.
- Extensible!
