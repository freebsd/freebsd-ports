Devd is a single statically compiled binary with no external dependencies.
No need to install gigantic frameworks like Node JS, just copy over the devd
binary and be done with it.

No config file, no daemonization, and logs that are designed to be read in the
terminal by a developer. Logs are colorized and log entries span multiple lines.
Devd's logs are detailed, warn about corner cases that other daemons ignore, and
can optionally include things like detailed timing information and full headers.

modd (devel/modd) is a sister-project of modd.
