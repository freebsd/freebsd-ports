CGI::Application::Plugin::AnyTemplate allows you to use any supported
Perl templating system using a single consistent interface.

Currently supported templating systems include HTML::Template,
HTML::Template::Expr, HTML::Template::Pluggable, Template::Toolkit and
Petal.

You can access any of these templating systems using the same
interface. In this way, you can use the same code and switch
templating systems on the fly.

This approach has many uses. For instance, it can be useful in
migrating your application from one templating system to another.
