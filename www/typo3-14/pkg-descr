We support each TYPO3 sprint release until the next minor version is published.
Once released in April 2026, the long-term support version of TYPO3 14 will
receive bug fixes until December 2027, and we will provide security updates until
June 2029.

We encourage users and agencies to install and use the sprint releases until
the LTS release is available. Further details about the releases and planned
release dates are available in the roadmap.
