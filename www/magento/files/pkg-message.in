POST-INSTALL CONFIGURATION FOR MAGENTO
=====================================

1) Create a MySQL user and a database for Magento to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   ### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30 or later.
   Alias /magento %%PREFIX%%/%%MAGENTODIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%MAGENTODIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

3) Visit your Magento site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/magento/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating the app/etc/local.xml file and then
   setting up Magento, creating an admin account, etc.

4) After installation consider setting app/etc back to mode 755 for security
   reasons.
