Mozilla gives a great flexibility and power to Javascript. This popular
client side scripting language can be used to create application level
logic and services for cross platform application development.

By creating libraries of common useful routines, application developers can
focus on creating original functionality for their own applications instead
of dealing w/ complex xpconnect wrapper objects and worrying about which
IDL methods do what and which are implemented on what platforms.

Goal: jslib has a simple goal, "Make life easier for Mozilla Application
Development by creating logical, easy to use API's for general purpose
routines that lend themselves to living in library code."
