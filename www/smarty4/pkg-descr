Smarty is a template engine for PHP. Many other template engines for PHP provide
basic variable substitution and dynamic block functionality. Smarty takes a step
further to be a "smart" template engine, adding features such as configuration
files, template functions, and variable modifiers, and making all of this
functionality as easy as possible to use for both programmers and template
designers. Smarty also converts the templates into PHP scripts, eliminating the
need to parse the templates on every invocation. This makes Smarty extremely
scalable and managable for large application needs.
