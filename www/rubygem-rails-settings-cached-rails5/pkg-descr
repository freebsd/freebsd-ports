Rails-settings-cached is a settings plugin that makes managing a table of global
key-value pairs easy. Think of it like a global hash stored in your database
that uses simple ActiveRecord-like methods for manipulation.

You can keep track of any global setting that you do not want to hard code into
your rails application.  You can store any kind of object including strings,
numbers, and arrays.
