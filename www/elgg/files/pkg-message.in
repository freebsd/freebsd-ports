POST-INSTALL CONFIGURATION FOR ELGG
===================================
1) Make sure your apache's mod_rewrite extension is working,
and change the AllowOverride setting of the DocumentRoot to
    AllowOverride all

2) Create a user and a empty database for Elgg to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

3) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   ### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30 or later.
   Alias /elgg %%WWWDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
      AllowOverride All
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

4) Visit your Elgg site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/elgg/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up Elgg.

   When ask for the site URL, please input:
       http://your.server.com/elgg/
   and for uploaded URL, please input:
       /usr/local/www/elggdata/
