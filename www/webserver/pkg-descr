The WebServer class provides the framework for a GNUstep program to act
as an HTTP or HTTPS server for simple applications.
It does not attempt to be a general-purpose web server, but is rather
intended to permit a program to easily handle requests from automated
systems which are intended to control, monitor, or use the services
provided by the program in which the class is embedded.
The emphasis is on making it robust/reliable/simple, so you can rapidly
develop software using it. It is a single-threaded, single-process
system using asynchronous I/O, so you can easily run it under debug
in gdb to fix any bugs in your delegate object.
