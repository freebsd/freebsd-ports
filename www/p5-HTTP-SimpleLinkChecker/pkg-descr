You don't have to know anything about objected-oriented Perl, LWP, or the 
HTTP module to be able to check your links. This module is designed for 
the casual user. It has one function, check_link, that returns the HTTP 
response code that it receives when it tries to fetch the web address 
passed to it. The undef value is returned for any non-HTTP failure and the 
$HTTP::SimpleLinkChecker::ERROR variable is set.

The HEAD method is tried first, although if anything other than a good 
status code (those less than 400) is received, another request is made 
with the GET method. Note, however, that even with the best code, no 
module can control how servers decide to respond to a check, or control 
any of the myriad things that can go wrong with the network between you 
and the remote server. Some may filter requests based on origin IP 
address, user-agent type, or any other arbitrary factor. Some servers may 
not respond correctly at all. Furthermore, some servers might be 
temporarily down or overloaded. I recommend that you recheck "broken" 
links a couple times over a long period (like a day or two) before you 
decide they are really broken.
