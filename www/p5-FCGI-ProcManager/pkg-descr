FCGI::ProcManager is used to serve as a FastCGI process manager.  By
re-implementing it in perl, developers can more finely tune performance in
their web applications, and can take advantage of copy-on-write semantics
prevalent in UNIX kernel process management.  The process manager should
be invoked before the caller''s request loop
