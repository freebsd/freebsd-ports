	Grail is an extensible Internet browser. It supports the
	protocols and file formats commonly found on the World-Wide
	Web, such as HTTP, FTP, and HTML, but, unlike most browsers,
	it is also easily extended to support other protocols or file
	formats, such as CNRI's handle protocol. Grail is distributed
	by CNRI free of charge, and can be freely redistributed
	(within reason).

	Grail is written and extensible in Python, a free
	object-oriented programming language. It also uses Tk, a free
	UI toolkit by John Ousterhout. Grail should run on any Unix
	system to which Python and Tk have been ported - i.e. almost
	all Unix systems supporting X11. In particular, Grail is one
	of the few web browsers that support Solaris for Intel x86
	processors. It now also runs on Windows and Macintosh, since
	there are now stable ports of Tk to those platforms. (You need
	a lot of RAM though.)
