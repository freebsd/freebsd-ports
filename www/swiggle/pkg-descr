swiggle is a small command line tool that generates HTML pages,
including thumbnail indexes, for given images
(a so called "web gallery").
It's intended to be easy to use, and since it is written in C,
it's quite speedy.

It uses libjpeg for decompression and compression of images,
libexif for getting EXIF information contained in the images,
and it caches scaled images so that subsequent runs don't need to
scale images again and are faster.
Of course, the original images aren't changed.

Currently, it only processes JPEG images, and it's thought
to be used primarily with images taken with digital cameras.
