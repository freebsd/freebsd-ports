oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third
party sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such
as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having
to parse the resource directly.  This gem is a simple-to-use and slim library to
work with oEmbed format. It has no external dependencies at runtime.  All you
need to have is Ruby itself.
