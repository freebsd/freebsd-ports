This is Apache version 1.3 plus mod_ssl which provides strong cryptography
via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS
v1) protocols by the help of the SSL/TLS implementation toolkit OpenSSL which
is based on SSLeay from Eric A. Young and Tim J. Hudson. The mod_ssl package
was created in April 1998 by Ralf S. Engelschall and was originally derived
from software developed by Ben Laurie for use in the Apache-SSL HTTP server
project. 

As a summary, here are its main SSL/TLS-related features:
   o  Open-Source software (BSD-style license)
   o  Useable for both commercial and non-commercial use
   o  Available for both Unix and Win32 (Windows 95/98/NT) platforms 
   o  128-bit strong cryptography world-wide
   o  Support for SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLSv1 protocols
   o  Support for both RSA and Diffie-Hellman ciphers
   o  Clean reviewable ANSI C source code 
   o  Clean Apache module architecture
   o  Integrates seamlessly into Apache through an Extended API (EAPI)
   o  Full Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support
   o  Advanced pass-phrase handling for private keys
   o  X.509 certificate based authentication for both client and server
   o  X.509 certificate revocation list (CRL) support
   o  Support for per-URL renegotiation of SSL handshake parameters
   o  Support for explicit seeding of the PRNG from external sources
   o  Additional boolean-expression based access control facility
   o  Backward compatibility to other Apache SSL solutions
   o  Inter-process SSL session cache (DBM and Shared Memory based)
   o  Powerful dedicated SSL engine logging facility
   o  Simple and robust application to Apache source trees
   o  Fully integrated into the Apache 1.3 configuration mechanism
   o  Additional integration into the Apache Autoconf-style Interface (APACI)
   o  Assistance in X.509v3 certificate generation (both RSA and DSA)
   o  Experimental support for external Crypto Devices (OpenSSL ENGINE)
