This is a Ruby implementation of a RDF Normalize for RDF.rb.  It is a Graph
normalizer for the RDF.rb library suite.  It generates normalized output for an
RDF Dataset using the algorithm defined in RDF Normalize.  It also implements an
RDF Writer interface, which can be used to serialize normalized statements.
