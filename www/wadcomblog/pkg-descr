WadcomBlog is a simple open-source static blog engine written in Python
by Vlad Skvortsov and distributed under BSD license.
It doesn't use any backend database but instead reads a set of plain i
text files (in RFC2822 format) and creates a tree of interlinked HTML pages
that may be then published. To update a blog one just needs to add a file
to the source tree and run the command-line WadcomBlog script
to regenerate the output.
