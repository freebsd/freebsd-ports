urlgrabber is a pure python package that drastically simplifies
the fetching of files. It is designed to be used in programs that
need common (but not necessarily simple) url-fetching features.
It is extremely simple to drop into an existing program and provides
a clean interface to protocol-independant file-access. Best of all,
urlgrabber takes care of all those pesky file-fetching details, and
lets you focus on whatever it is that your program is written to do!
