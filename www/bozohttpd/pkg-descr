Bozohttpd is a small and secure HTTP version 1.1 server. Its main feature
is the lack of features, reducing the code size and improving verifiability.

It supports CGI/1.1, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/0.9, ~user translations,
virtual hosting support, as well as multiple IP-based servers on a single
machine. It is capable of services pages via the IPv6 protocol. It has no
configuration file by design. Recently added features are htpasswd, SSL,
and dynamic redirection, that can be easily disabled.
