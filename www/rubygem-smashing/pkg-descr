Smashing, the spiritual successor to Dashing, is a Sinatra-based framework that
lets you build excellent dashboards. You write a bit of ruby code to gather data
from some services and let Smashing handle the rest - displaying that data in a
wonderfully simple layout. Built for developers and hackers, Smashing is highly
customizable while maintaining humble roots that make it approachable to
beginners.
