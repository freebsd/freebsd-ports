***********************************************************
  To start Privoxy on boot, add: privoxy_enable="YES"
  to /etc/rc.conf.

  To start Privoxy manually, run:
  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/privoxy forcestart
  The script understands most of the commands listed
  in rc(8), it also contains a list of other rc
  variables you can use.

  Privoxy's example files were copied to:
  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%

  For documentation see:
  %%DOCSDIR%%/user-manual or 'man privoxy'

  Note that default.filter and default.action get
  overwritten with each Privoxy update. Instead of
  changing them you should use your own action and
  filter files as described in Privoxy's manual.

  If you installed Privoxy as package and are using the
  default configuration, you have to make sure the
  directories /var/log/privoxy and /var/run/privoxy
  exist and are owned by privoxy:privoxy.
