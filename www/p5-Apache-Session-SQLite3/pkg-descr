This module is an implementation of Apache::Session. 
It uses the DBD::SQLite backing store. It requires DBD::SQLite 
version 1.00 or above, due to its use of SQLite3 API for BLOB support. 
Also, an extra LastUpdated field is populated with the current time().

There is no need to create the data source file beforehand; 
this module creates the session table automatically.
