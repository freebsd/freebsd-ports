   o  To run Cherokee at startup or using the rc script, you need
      to add

      cherokee_enable="YES"

      in either /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or
      /etc/rc.conf.d/cherokee.

   o  To start the Cherokee administrative interface, run (as root)

      cherokee-admin

      For more information on cherokee-admin(1), please refer to
      the official documentation and manpage.


   o  By default, the cherokee daemon runs as www:www user.
      If you need it to run as another user, you'll need to manually
      adjust Makefile and recompile the port.
