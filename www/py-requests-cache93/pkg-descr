requests-cache is a transparent, persistent cache that provides an easy way to
get better performance with the python requests library.

Features:
- Ease of use: Keep using the requests library you're already familiar with. Add
  caching with a drop-in replacement for requests.Session, or install globally
  to add caching to all requests functions.
- Performance: Get sub-millisecond response times for cached responses. When
  they expire, you still save time with conditional requests.
- Persistence: Works with several storage backends including SQLite, Redis,
  MongoDB, and DynamoDB; or save responses as plain JSON files, YAML, and more
- Customization: Works out of the box with zero config, but with a robust set of
  features for configuring and extending the library to suit your needs
- Expiration: Keep your cache fresh using Cache-Control, eagerly cache
  everything for long-term storage, use URL patterns for selective caching, or
  any combination of strategies
- Compatibility: Can be combined with other popular libraries based on requests
