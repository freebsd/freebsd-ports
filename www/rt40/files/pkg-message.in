=====================================================================

To complete the installation of this port, please follow these steps:

1. Edit %%RT_ETC_PATH%%/RT_SiteConfig.pm, by referring to
   the default config file (%%RT_ETC_PATH%%/RT_Config.pm).
2. Configure the email and web gateways.  Please refer to
   'SETTING UP THE MAIL GATEWAY' in %%DOCSDIR%%/README
3. Restart Apache.
4. Do remember to *CHANGE* the root's password for the web interface.
   The default is "password" (without the quotes.)
5. Configure RT per the instructions at
   http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/docs.html

If you're upgrading RT then it is worth reading the UPGRADING document
at this point. Some extension you're using may have been integrated
into core. It's recommended to use new clean directory when you're
upgrading to new major release (for example from 3.8.x to 4.0.x).

To upgrade your database schema, preserving ticket history:

1. Backup your RT database.
2. If upgrading to a new major release, create a new database named
   rt4 with appropriate rights for the rt_user and reload your
   database backup into it.
3. Run:

# /usr/local/sbin/rt-setup-database \
     --datadir %%DOCSDIR%%/upgrade \
     --action upgrade --prompt-for-dba-password

and answer the prompts.

RT does not work with perl taint mode (-T) you must disable it.
Note, some other ports like devel/bugzilla have you add this to your
httpd.conf.  This isn't actually a flaw of RT, but of a subset of the
CPAN modules that RT uses.

$ sudo perl rt-setup-database --action init --dba dba --dba-password X
$ sudo perl rt-setup-database --action drop --dba dba --dba-password X

See the TODO section at the top of the port's Makefile
