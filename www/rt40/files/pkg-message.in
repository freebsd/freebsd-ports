=====================================================================

To complete the installation of this port, please follow these steps:

1. Edit %%RT_ETC_PATH%%/RT_SiteConfig.pm, by referring to
   the default config file (%%RT_ETC_PATH%%/RT_Config.pm).
2. Configure the email and web gateways.  Please refer to
   'SETTING UP THE MAIL GATEWAY' in %%DOCSDIR%%/README
3. Restart Apache.
4. Do remember to *CHANGE* the root's password for the web interface.
   The default is "password" (without the quotes.)
5. Configure RT per the instructions at
   http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/docs.html

If you're upgrading RT then it worth to read UPGRADING document at this
moment. Some extension you're using may have been integrated into 
core. It's recommended to use new clean directory when you're
upgrading to new major release (for example from 3.8.x to 4.0.x).

RT does not work with perl taint mode (-T) you must disable it.
Note, some other ports like devel/bugzilla have you add this to your
httpd.conf.  This isn't actually a flaw of RT, but of a subset of the
CPAN modules that RT uses.

$ sudo perl rt-setup-database --action init --dba dba --dba-password X
$ sudo perl rt-setup-database --action drop --dba dba --dba-password X

See the TODO section at the top of the port's Makefile
