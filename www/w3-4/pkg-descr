w3-2.2.26 package is WWW browser package for emacs.

Info path and elisp load path would be set as follows :

    Info path - /usr/local/info
    load path - /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/w3

You may be happy by adding following lines to your .emacs file:

	(setq url-keep-history t)
	(setq url-be-asynchronous t)
	(setq w3-default-homepage
		"file://localhost/usr/share/doc/handbook/handbook.html")

and copying .mosaic-hotlist-default file from /usr/local/share/examples/w3
directory to your home directory.

Setting above user environment would be only executed by
/usr/local/share/examples/w3/user-install on your home directory. 

If you want to get an typesetting manual, copy Makefile and w3.texi from
/usr/local/share/doc/w3 and 'make w3.dvi'.

If you have installed correctly, type "M-x w3". Enjoy!
