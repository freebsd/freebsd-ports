Emacs/W3 is a full-featured web browser, written entirely in Emacs-Lisp,
that supports all the bells and whistles you will find in use on the web
today, including frames, tables, stylesheets, and much more. Emacs/W3
runs on most major operating systems, including almost any flavor of Unix,
Windows NT/95, AmigaDOS, OS/2, and VMS. 

Emacs/W3 4.0 is the first major release of Emacs/W3 in almost a year, and
is a major upgrade. Please read the documentation carefully if you are
upgrading. If you run into any problems, please read the FAQ to see if
you have run into a common problem.
