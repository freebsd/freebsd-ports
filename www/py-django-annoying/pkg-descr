This is a django application that tries to eliminate annoying
things in the Django framework.

Features:

    render_to decorator - reduce typing in django views.
    signals decorator - allow use signals as decorators.
    ajax_request decorator - returns JsonResponse with this dict as content.
    autostrip decorator - strip text form fields before validation.
    get_object_or_None function - similar to get_object_or_404, but
	returns None if object not found.
    get_config function - get settings from django.conf if exists,
	return default value otherwise.
    AutoOneToOne field - creates related object on first call if it
	doesn't exist yet.
    HttpResponseReload - reload and stay on same page from where request
	was made.
    StaticServer middleware - instead of configuring urls.py, just
	add this middleware and it will serve you static files.
    JSONField - custom field that lets you easily store JSON data in one of
	your model fields.
