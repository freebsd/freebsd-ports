Read and write JSON Web Keys (JWK, rfc7517), generate and verify JSON Web
Signatures (JWS, rfc7515) and encode/decode JSON Web Tokens (JWT, rfc7519)
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/documents/>. These standards provide
modern signing and encryption formats that are natively supported by browsers
via the JavaScript WebCryptoAPI <https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#jose>, and
used by services like OAuth 2.0, LetsEncrypt, and Github Apps.
