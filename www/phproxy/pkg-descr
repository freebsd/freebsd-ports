PHProxy is a web HTTP (for now; FTP is not supprted yet)
proxy programmed in PHP designed to bypass firewalls and
other proxy restrictions through a web interface very similar
to the popular CGIProxy.

The server that this script runs on simply acts as a medium
that retrives resources for you. The only IP address shown
will be the server's IP address. So basically, it is indirect
browsing. The only catch being that the server has to has access
to those otherwise inaccessible resources.
