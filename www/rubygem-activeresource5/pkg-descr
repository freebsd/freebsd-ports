Active Resource

Active Resource attempts to provide a coherent wrapper object-relational
mapping for REST web services. It follows the same philosophy as
Active Record, in that one of its prime aims is to reduce the amount of
code needed to map to these resources.  This is made possible by relying
on a number of code- and protocol-based conventions that make it easy for
Active Resource to infer complex relations and structures.

These conventions are outlined in detail in the documentation
for ActiveResource::Base.
