Complete instructions for installing and configuring Drupal can be found here:

%%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.txt

You need to create the DB where Drupal is going to live, and depending on
which database you intend to use, you should consult one of the following
documents:

 %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.mysql.txt
 %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.pgsql.txt
 %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.sqlite.txt

You also need to add appropriate configuration directives to your apache
configuration file (%%PREFIX%%/etc/apache(2)/httpd.conf).

A typical configuration might read:

    Alias /drupal "%%WWWDIR%%"
    <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%">
	Options Indexes FollowSymlinks MultiViews
	AllowOverride all
	Require all granted
    </Directory>

Please see http://drupal.org/cron for important information on setting up
periodic maintenance tasks in Drupal.
