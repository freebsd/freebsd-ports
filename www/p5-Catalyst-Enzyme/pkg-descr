Catalyst::Enzyme is a layer on top of the Catalyst framework providing
CRUD functionality for Class::DBI models.

Enzyme uses convention and configuration to provide e.g. extensible
CRUD out-of-the-box, and a common way of dealing with error handling
etc.

It's not completely unlike Maypole in this regard. However, at this
point Enzyme isn't as feature-rich as Maypole.

Enzyme is one way of bringing many Catalyst modules and concepts
together into a unified whole. There are other ways to do this
(obviously. This is, like... uh, Perl).
