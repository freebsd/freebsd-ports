POST-INSTALLATION NOTES:

Before you can use NanoBlogger, you will have to create a global configuration
file to set default information and paths to template files.

A sample configuration file has been installed in:
 %%PREFIX%%/etc/nb.conf.sample

If no global configuration file is already present, it has been installed as:
 %%PREFIX%%/etc/nb.conf

Otherwise, since there are already some sensible default settings, you can
overwrite it and begin with a fresh one:
 # cp %%PREFIX%%/etc/nb.conf.sample %%PREFIX%%/etc/nb.conf

The provided documentation and the preferred upgrade path (in the README
file) can be found in the additional documentation directory:
  %%DOCSDIR%%/*

SIDE NOTES FOR OLD USERS:

As always with new release, don't forget to read the documentation and to
update your weblog configuration file, e.g. ${blog_dir}/blog.conf.
