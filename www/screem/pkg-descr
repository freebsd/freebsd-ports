SCREEM (Site CReating and Editing EnvironMent) is a VERY nice
GUI-based HTML editor, much like bluefish. It even imports bluefish
functions from your bluefish installation!

SCREEM makes a rather ideal GUI HTML editor, especially for
Unixheads who like using CVS to manage source trees, as SCREEM
has functional CVS interaction.
