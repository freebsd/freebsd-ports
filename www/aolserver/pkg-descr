AOLserver is a highly-optimized multi-threaded web server. 
It is used by America Online to power the busiest sites on the internet
such as AOL.com, Netscape.com, Mapquest.com and Moviefone.com.
AOLserver is similar in scope to servers such as BEA Weblogic, 
IBM's Websphere and Apache's Tomcat.

The features that make it a strong server include
- a multi-threaded architecture for extremely efficient performance
  in high demand environments
- native database APIs for simplified database access
- pooled database connections for fast, readily available database connectivity 
- an embedded scripting language (Tcl) for rapid development of business logic.

AOLserver is also open source and freely available.
