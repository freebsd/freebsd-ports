Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve fast
clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take advantage of
features in Unix/Unix-like kernels. Slow clients should only be served by
placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering both the request and
response in between Unicorn and slow clients.
