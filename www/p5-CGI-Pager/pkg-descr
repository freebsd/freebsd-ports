CGI::Pager performs the "dirty work" necessary to program paginated
data display in a web application.

Based on given resultset size, page size, and offset value sensed from
current URI, it constructs links for navigation between results pages.

It can be used conveniently from a templating system, has both OO and
functional interface, and can optionally generate necessary HTML
itself.
