A fast and easy way to integrate your apps with Facebook.

This is a Perl interface to the Facebook Graph API
http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api.  With this module you can
currently query public Facebook data, query privileged Facebook data,
and build a privileged Facebook application.  See the TODO for all
that this module cannot yet do.
