Kallithea is a fast and powerful management tool for Mercurial and Git with a
built-in push/pull server, full text search and code-review. It works on
http/https and has a built in permission/authentication system with the ability
to authenticate via LDAP or ActiveDirectory. Kallithea also provides simple API
so it's easy to integrate with existing external systems.

Kallithea is similar in some respects to GitHub or Bitbucket, however Kallithea
can be run as standalone hosted application on your own server. It is
open-source donationware and focuses more on providing a customised,
self-administered interface for Mercurial and Git repositories. Kallithea works
on Unix-like systems and Windows, and is powered by the vcs library created by
Lukasz Balcerzak and Marcin Kuzminski to uniformly handle multiple version
control systems.

Kallithea was forked from RhodeCode in July 2014 and has been heavily modified.
