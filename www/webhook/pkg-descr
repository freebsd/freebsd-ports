Easily create HTTP endpoints (hooks) to execute shell commands

webhook is a lightweight configurable tool written in Go, that allows you to
easily create HTTP endpoints (hooks) on your server, which you can use to
execute configured commands.  You can also pass data from the HTTP request
(such as headers, payload or query variables) to your commands.  webhook
also allows you to specify rules which have to be satisfied in order for the
hook to be triggered.
