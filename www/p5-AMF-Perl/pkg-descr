Flash Remoting is a way for Flash movies running in a web browser to
request structured data from the web server.  The following data types
are supported - strings, numbers, dates, arrays, dictionaries/hashes,
objects, recordsets.  Flash clients talk with the server using the AMF
protocol, which is proprietary to Macromedia.  However, it's not that
hard to decode.

Using Flash::FLAP it is possible to send arbitrary data between client
and server using very few lines of code.  There is no need to pack
complicated data structures into CGI form parameteres or XML strings.
The coding time can be spent on better things - data preparation and
graphical presentation, not data delivery.
