The "demjson" module, and the included "jsonlint" script, provide methods for
encoding and decoding JSON formatted data, as well as checking JSON data for
errors and/or portability issues.  The jsonlint command/script can be used from
the command line without needing any programming.  Although the standard Python
library now includes basic JSON support (which it did not when demjson was first
written), this module provides a much more comprehensive implementation with
many features not found elsewhere.  It is especially useful for error checking
or for parsing JavaScript data which may not strictly be valid JSON data.
