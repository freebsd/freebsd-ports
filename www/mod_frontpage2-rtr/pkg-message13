1.)

Check your httpd.conf, if you have included a ResourceConfig and
AccessConfig. If you do not have these files, you'll have to add
these lines to make the frontpage extensions work properly. These
lines are commented out in the default config, so you'll have to
activate them again. If you have a real ResourceConfig and
AccessConfig, you can skip this part.

ResourceConfig /dev/null
AccessConfig /dev/null


2.)

You'll need to change the AllowOverride directive under the
default web from None to at least "AuthConfig Limit Indexes Options".

<Directory "%%PREFIX%%/www/data">
:
AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit Indexes Options
:
</Directory>

Don't use "AllowOverride All" if you have a server environment
with customers, since this can be a security risk, as they
could modify the .htaccess files themselves.

You'll also need to change the AllowOverride Directive on all
virtual hosts that you are going to enable with Frontpage Extentions.


3.)

You can turn the extensions and the frontpage administration on/off
per site in httpd.conf and per virtual server.

FrontPage On/Off	# Allows/Disallows Client to publish with
			  FrontPage Extensions
FrontPageAdmin On/Off	# Allows/Disallows Administration of web site
			  with FrontPage Extensions

By default FrontPage Extentions and Administration are enabled.  If
the module has been compiled with WITH_DISABLED, then you need to
add one of the above directives.

If the module has been compiled with WITH_MODFP_COMPAT, then the
following directives from the Improved Mod_Frontpage are available:

FrontPageEnable         # Same as 'FrontPage On'
FrontPageDisable        # Same as 'FrontPage Off'
FrontPageAdminEnable    # Same as 'FrontPageAdmin On'
FrontPageAdminDisable   # Same as 'FrontPageAdmin Off'


4.)

If this is a fresh Apache install, you should remove the symbolic link
to the %%PREFIX%%/www/data directory, and create a real directory.

rm %%PREFIX%%/www/data
mkdir %%PREFIX%%/www/data


5.)

After you have made these changes, you'll need to execute:

%%PREFIX%%/frontpage/version5.0/fp_install.sh

to build the base apache/frontpage web site and to setup frontpage
users and admins.  You can also run this to add virtual hosts to
the apache/frontpage system.

NOTE: If you get this error:

    Error: An access setup description is required when creating the root web.

check the document root for .htaccess files.  Rename them, and then combine
them with the .htaccess files created by the frontpage install.


6.)

If you have installed the port in another PREFIX than "/usr/local"
you have to create a symlink. Microsoft has hardcoded the local
path in their binarys. If you do not use fp_install.sh, you have
to create the link manually:

ln -s %%PREFIX%%/frontpage /usr/local/frontpage


NOTE:

1. When using owsadm.exe, you need to specify the server type in the
   command.

    owsadm.exe -t apache-fp ...

2. To create the Global Administration web site use:

    owsadm.exe -o setadminport -p <PORT> -t apache-fp \
	-s %%PREFIX%%/etc/apache/httpd.conf -username <USERNAME> \
	-pw <PASSWORD>

    where PORT is not equal to any existing web servers port.

3. To remove the Global Administration web site use:

    owsadm -o deleteadminport -t apache-fp \
	-s %%PREFIX%%/etc/apache/httpd.conf
