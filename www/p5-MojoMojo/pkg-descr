Mojomojo is a sort of content managment system, borrowing many concepts
from wikis and blogs. It allows you to maintain a full tree-structure
of pages, and to interlink them in various ways. It has full version
support, so you can always go back to a previous version and see what's
changed with an easy AJAX- based diff system. There are also a bunch of
other features like bult-in fulltext search, live AJAX preview of editing,
and RSS feeds for every wiki page.

To find out more about how you can use MojoMojo, please visit

MojoMojo::Installation to try it out yourself.
