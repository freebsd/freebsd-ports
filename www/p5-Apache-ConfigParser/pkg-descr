The Apache::ConfigParser module is used to load an Apache configuration 
file to allow programs to determine Apache's configuration directives and 
contexts. The resulting object contains a tree based structure using the 
Apache::ConfigParser::Directive class, which is a subclass of 
Tree::DAG_node, so all of the methods that enable tree based searches and 
modifications from Tree::DAG_Node are also available. The tree structure 
is used to represent the ability to nest sections, such as <VirtualHost>, 
<Directory>, etc.

Apache does a great job of checking Apache configuration files for errors 
and this modules leaves most of that to Apache. This module does minimal 
configuration file checking. The module currently checks for:

Start and end context names match

    The module checks if the start and end context names match. If the end 
context name does not match the start context name, then it is ignored. 
The module does not even check if the configuration contexts have valid 
names.
