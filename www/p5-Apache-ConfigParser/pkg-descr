The Apache::ConfigParser module is used to load an Apache configuration
file to allow programs to determine Apache's configuration directives and
contexts. The resulting object contains a tree based structure using the
Apache::ConfigParser::Directive class, which is a subclass of
Tree::DAG_node, so all of the methods that enable tree based searches and
modifications from Tree::DAG_Node are also available. The tree structure
is used to represent the ability to nest sections, such as <VirtualHost>,
<Directory>, etc.

Apache does a great job of checking Apache configuration files for errors
and this modules leaves most of that to Apache. This module does minimal
configuration file checking. The module currently checks for:

Start and end context names match

    The module checks if the start and end context names match. If the end
context name does not match the start context name, then it is ignored.
The module does not even check if the configuration contexts have valid
names.
