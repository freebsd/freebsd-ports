Toadfarm is a module for configuring and starting your Mojolicious
applications. You can either combine multiple applications in one
script, or just use it as a init script.

Core features:

  * Wrapper around hypnotoad that provides an init script.

  * Advanced routing and virtual host configuration. Also support
    routing from behind another web server, such as nginx. This
    feature is very much like Mojolicious::Plugin::Mount on steroids.

  * Hijacking log messages to a common log file. There's also plugin,
    Toadfarm::Plugin::AccessLog, that allows you to log the requests
    sent to your server.
