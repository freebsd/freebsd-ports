Create easy to maintain HTML widgets!

Everything is optional, use validation only or just generate forms, you
can embed and merge them later.

The API was designed similar to other popular modules like Data::Form-
Validator and FormValidator::Simple, HTML::FillInForm is also built in
(and much faster).
