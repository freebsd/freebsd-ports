rust-wasm seeks to be a one-stop shop for building and working with rust-
generated WebAssembly that you would like to interop with JavaScript, in the
browser or with Node.js. `wasm-pack` helps you build rust-generated
WebAssembly packages that you could publish to the npm registry, or otherwise
use alongside any javascript packages in workflows that you already use, such
as webpack.
