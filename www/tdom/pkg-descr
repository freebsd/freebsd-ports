tDOM combines high performance XML data processing with easy and powerful Tcl
scripting functionality.

tDOM should be one of the fastest ways to manipulate XML with a scripting
language and uses very few memory (for example the DOM tree of the XML
recommendation in XML (160K) needs only about 450K in memory)!
