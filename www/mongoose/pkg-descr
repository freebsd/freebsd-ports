Mongoose is a small, fast and easy to use web server. It supports
CGI, SSI, SSL, Digest auth, Websocket, WEbDAV, Resumed download, URL
rewrite, file blacklist. Having SHTTPD as a predecessor, another
feature of mongoose is the ability to embed it into existing C/C++
applications. Embedded API is very clean and simple.
Mongoose has small memory footprint. Use it when other
web servers like Apache are too heavy for your tasks.
