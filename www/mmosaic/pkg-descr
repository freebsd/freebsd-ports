This is a Web browser based partly on NCSA Mosaic.  It supports
multiple windows, tables, PNG and JPEG images, and frames.
 
In this port, IPv6 does not work, nor do X resources.

Its components are licensed variously.  It may be used internally
in a business, but may not be sold.  Once compiled, the program
must not be distributed, because conflicts among the licenses.
Its source cannot be distributed if it is needed for a product
being sold by the person doing the distributing.  See
