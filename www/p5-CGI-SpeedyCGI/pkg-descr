SpeedyCGI is a way to run CGI perl scripts persistently, which usually
makes them run much more quickly. A script can be converted to
SpeedyCGI by changing the interpreter line at the top of the
script. After the script is initially run, instead of exiting,
SpeedyCGI keeps the perl interpreter running. During subsequent runs,
this interpreter is used to handle new requests instead of starting a
new perl interpreter for each execution.
