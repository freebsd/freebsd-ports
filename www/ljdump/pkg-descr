ljdump reads the journal entries from a LiveJournal (or compatible) blog
site and archives them in a subdirectory named after the journal name.
Both the journal entries and journal comments are downloaded.

The program may be run as often as needed to bring the backup copy up to
date.  Both new and updated items are downloaded.

ljdump uses only standard Python libraries, so it will work wherever
Python itself does (Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, etc).
