meld3 is an HTML/XML templating system for Python 2.3+ which keeps template
markup and dynamic rendering logic separate from one another. 

meld3 can deal with HTML or XML/XHTML input and can output well-formed HTML or 
XML/XHTML.

meld3 is a variation of Paul Winkler's Meld2, which is itself a variation of 
Richie Hindle's PyMeld.
