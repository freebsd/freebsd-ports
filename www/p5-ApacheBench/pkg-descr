This is ApacheBench version 0.62, the Perl API for Apache benchmarking
and regression testing.

This project is meant to be the foundation of a complete benchmarking
and regression testing suite for a transaction- processing mod_perl
site. We needed to be able to stress our server to its limit while also
having a way to verify the HTTP responses for correctness. We also
extended the single-URL ab model to a multiple-URL sequence model.

ApacheBench is based on the Apache 1.3.12 ab code (src/support/ab.c).
Since the initial release, I have made efforts to merge in all the
newest features of ab. Currently (v0.62) it has almost all the features
of Apache 1.3.22 ab.
