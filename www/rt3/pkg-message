===============================================================

To complete the installation of this port, you have to do the
following things:

1. Run %%PREFIX%%/rt2/etc/insertdata <last_version_of_rt> if you're
   upgrading from an older version.
2. Edit %%PREFIX%%/rt2/etc/config.pm
3. Configure the email and web gateways.  Please refer to 'SETTING UP
   THE MAIL GATEWAY' in %%PREFIX%%/rt2/README
4. Restart Apache.
5. Do remember to *CHANGE* the root's password for the web interface.
   The default is "password" (without the quotes.)
6. Configure RT per the instructions at http://www.fsck.com/rtfm/.

NOTE:   Please remember to use a statically compiled mod_perl,
	and configure mod_fastcgi for a faster rt2.
