This is the Beonex Communicator suite (Web browser, HTML editor, e-mail user
agent, news reader, address book, and spell-checker).  It is based on Mozilla,
but with extra emphasis on security and privacy.

Because of a security bug, the Chatzilla IRC client is not included in this
port.  Support for SVG and threading are disabled because of compilation
problems.  Java has not been tested.
