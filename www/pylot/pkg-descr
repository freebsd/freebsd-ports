Pylot is a free open source tool for testing performance and scalability of
web services. It runs HTTP load tests, which are useful for capacity planning,
benchmarking, analysis, and system tuning.

Pylot generates concurrent load (HTTP Requests), verifies server responses,
and produces reports with metrics. Tests suites are executed and monitored
from a GUI or shell/console.
