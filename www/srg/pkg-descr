SRG is a Squid Report Generator designed for the needs of CRCnet.
None of the existing report generators could provide the exact solution
that we required and we decided to start from scratch rather than trying
to modify an existing progamme. SRG is designed to be fast and easy
to integrate in to other authentication systems
(such as those that are driving Squid itself).

Features

    * PHP Output with built in authentication hooks
    * Fast Processing
    * Reporting right down the the location vistied
