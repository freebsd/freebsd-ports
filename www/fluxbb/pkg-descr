FluxBB is an open source forum application released under the
GNU General Public Licence. It is free to download and use and
will remain so. FluxBB was conceived and designed to be fast and
light with less of the "not so essential" features that some of
the other forums have whilst not sacrificing essential functionality
or usability.
