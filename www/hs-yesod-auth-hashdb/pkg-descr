This package is the Yesod.Auth.HashDB plugin, originally included in
yesod-auth, but now modified to be more secure and placed in a separate
package.

It provides authentication using hashed passwords stored in a database,
and works best in situations where an administrator is involved in
setting up a user with an initial password.

The complete login process, including a default form, is implemented by
this plugin, but the application developer must design the interfaces
for setting up users and allowing them to change their own passwords,
since only the low-level password-setting functions are provided by this
package.
