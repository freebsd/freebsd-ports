NoScript provides extra protection for your Mozilla/Firefox
or Flock browser: this extension allows JavaScript and Java
execution only for trusted domains of your choice (e.g. your
home-banking web site).

This whitelist based pre-emptive script blocking approach
prevents exploitation of security vulnerabilities (known and
even not known yet!) with no loss of functionality...
