We support each TYPO3 sprint release until the next minor version is published.
Once released in April 2023, the long-term support version of TYPO3 12 will receive
bug fixes until October 2024, and we will provide security updates until April 2026.

We encourage users and agencies to install and use the sprint releases until the
LTS release is available. Further details about the releases and planned release
dates are available in the roadmap.
