Passwd is the Horde password changing application. While it has been
released and is in production use at many sites, it is also under heavy
development in an effort to expand and improve the module.

Right now, Passwd provides fairly complete support for changing passwords
via Poppassd, LDAP, Unix expect scripts, the Unix smbpasswd command for
SMB/CIFS passwords, Kolab, ADSI, Pine, Serv-U FTP, VMailMgr, vpopmail,
and SQL passwords.
