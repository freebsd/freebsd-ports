POST-INSTALL CONFIGURATION FOR TYPO3
=====================================

1) Add the following to your Apache configuration file
   httpd.conf, and restart the server:

   For Apache versions earlier than 2.4:

   Alias /typo3 %%PREFIX%%/%%TYPO3WWW%%/%%TYPO3DIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%TYPO3WWW%%/%%TYPO3DIR%%>
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

   For Apache version 2.4.x or above:

   Alias /typo3 %%PREFIX%%/%%TYPO3WWW%%/%%TYPO3DIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%TYPO3WWW%%/%%TYPO3DIR%%/>
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
   </Directory>

3) Visit your Moodle site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/typo3/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up Moodle, creating an admin account, etc.
