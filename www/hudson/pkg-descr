Hudson monitors executions of repeated jobs, such as building a software
project or jobs run by cron. Among those things, current Hudson focuses on the
following two jobs:

  1. Building/testing software projects continuously, just like CruiseControl
  or DamageControl. In a nutshell, Hudson provides an easy-to-use so-called
  continuous integration system, making it easier for developers to integrate
  changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh
  build. The automated, continuous build increases the productivity.

  2. Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as cron jobs and
  procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine. For example, with
  cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that capture the output, and it is
  up to you to look at them diligently and notice when it broke. Hudson keeps
  those outputs and makes it easy for you to notice when something is wrong.
