Django-cron lets you run Django/Python code on a recurring basis providing
basic plumbing to track and execute tasks. The two most common ways in which
most people go about this is either writing custom python scripts or a
management command per cron (leads to too many management commands).

Along with that some mechanism to track success, failure etc. is also usually
necessary.

This app solves both issues to a reasonable extent. This is by no means a
replacement for queues like Celery etc.
