LessTif is a API compatible clone of the Motif.
Currently Motif (statically linked by Netscape4) has a critical bug
around multi-byte handling in TextWidget such as <input type=text>
and <textarea> fields. This port will solve the above problem of
linux-netscape (like www/libxpg4-ns for our native Netscape).

To activate this port, make sure that you use netscape-dynMotif instead
of communicator(navigator)-linux-x.xx.bin in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/netscape-linux/.
