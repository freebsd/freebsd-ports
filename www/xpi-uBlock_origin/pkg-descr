uBlock Origin is not an ad blocker; it's a general-purpose blocker. uBlock
origin blocks ads through its support of the Adblock Plus filter syntax.

It extends the syntax and is designed to work with custom rules and filters.
Furthermore, advanced mode allows uBlock origin to work in default-deny mode,
which mode will cause all 3rd-party network requests to be blocked by default,
unless allowed by the user.
