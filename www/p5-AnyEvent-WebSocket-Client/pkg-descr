This class provides an interface to interact with a web server that
provides services via the WebSocket protocol in an AnyEvent context.
It uses Protocol::WebSocket rather than reinventing the wheel. You could
use AnyEvent and Protocol::WebSocket directly if you wanted finer grain
control, but if that is not necessary then this class may save you some
time.
