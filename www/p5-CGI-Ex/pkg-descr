CGI::Ex provides a suite of utilities to make writing CGI scripts more
enjoyable. Although they can all be used separately, the main functionality of
each of the modules is best represented in the CGI::Ex::App module. CGI::Ex::App
takes CGI application building to the next step. CGI::Ex::App is not quite a
framework (which normally includes pre-built html) instead CGI::Ex::App is an
extended application flow that dramatically reduces CGI build time in most
cases. It does so using as little magic as possible. See CGI::Ex::App.

The main functionality is provided by several other modules that may be used
separately, or together through the CGI::Ex interface.
