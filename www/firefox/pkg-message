======================================================================

Some features available on other platforms are not implemented:
- Native audio (OSS backend is incomplete, doesn't support WebRTC)
- Encrypted Media Extensions (requires Widevine CDM binary)
- Process sandboxing (requires Capsicum backend)
- Reduced memory usage (requires mozjemalloc)
- Performance profiling (requires GeckoProfiler)
- Gamepad API (requires libusbhid backend)
- WebVR (requires open source runtime)
- U2F Security Keys (requires libusbhid backend)

======================================================================

To select non-default audio backend open about:config page and create
media.cubeb.backend preference. Supported values are: alsa, jack,
pulse, pulse-rust, oss, sndio. Currently used backend can be inspected
on about:support page.

======================================================================

smb:// issues (Gvfs/GIO option):
Network group, machine, and share browsing does not work correctly.

sftp:// (Gvfs/GIO option):
Only sftp access using public key authentication works.  To easily
setup public key authentication to "remote_host":

ssh-keygen
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_host "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

The SSH server on remote_host must allow pub key authentication.
