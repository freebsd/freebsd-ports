Twig is a modern template engine for PHP.

 * Fast: Twig compiles templates down to plain optimized PHP code. The
         overhead compared to regular PHP code was reduced to the very
         minimum.

 * Secure: Twig has a sandbox mode to evaluate untrusted template code.
           This allows Twig to be used as a template language for
           applications where users may modify the template design.

 * Flexible: Twig is powered by a flexible lexer and parser. This allows
             the developer to define its own custom tags and filters, and
             create its own DSL.
