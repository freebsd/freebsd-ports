This package helps to retrieve SourceForge site information in a perl script.

So far, can only get very basic information. The goal is to be able to fetch 
Tracker and Mailing list data. Please send any suggestions directly to me.

Use at your own risk, the author is not responsible to any damage caused by 
using this package.
