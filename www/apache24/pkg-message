To run apache www server from startup, add apache24_enable="yes"
in your /etc/rc.conf. Extra options can be found in startup script.

Your hostname must be resolvable using at least 1 mechanism in
/etc/nsswitch.conf typically DNS or /etc/hosts or apache might
have issues starting depending on the modules you are using.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- apache24 default build changed from static MPM to modular MPM
- more modules are now enabled per default in the port
- icons and error pages moved from WWWDIR to DATADIR

   If build with modular MPM and no MPM is activated in
   httpd.conf, then mpm_prefork will be activated as default
   MPM in etc/apache24/modules.d to keep compatibility with
   existing php/perl/python modules!

Please compare the existing httpd.conf with httpd.conf.sample
and merge missing modules/instructions into httpd.conf!
