For correct operation, shared memory support has to be enabled
in Iridium by performing the following command as root :

sysctl $SYSCTL=1

To preserve this setting across reboots, append the following
to /etc/sysctl.conf :

$SYSCTL=1
EOMSG
	exit 1
fi
ulimit -c 0
exec %%PREFIX%%/share/iridium/iridium ${1+"$@"}
