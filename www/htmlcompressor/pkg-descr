Java HTML/XML Compressor is a very small, fast and easy to use library
that minifies given HTML or XML source by removing extra whitespaces,
comments and other unneeded characters without breaking the content
structure.  As a result pages become smaller in size and load faster.

A command-line version of the compressor is also included.
