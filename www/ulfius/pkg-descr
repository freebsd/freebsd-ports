HTTP Framework for REST Applications in C.

Based on GNU Libmicrohttpd for the backend web server, Jansson for the json
manipulation library, and Libcurl for the http/smtp client API.

Used to facilitate creation of web applications in C programs with a small
memory footprint, as in embedded systems applications.

You can create webservices in HTTP or HTTPS mode, stream data, or implement
server websockets.
