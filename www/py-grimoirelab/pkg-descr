GrimoireLab is a CHAOSS toolset for software development analytics. It
includes a coordinated set of tools to retrieve data from systems used
to support software development (repositories), store it in databases,
enrich it by computing relevant metrics, and make it easy to run
analytics and visualizations on it.
