Pebble is a lightweight, open source, Java EE blogging tool. It's small, fast
and feature-rich with unrivalled ease of installation and use. Blog content is
stored as XML files on disk and served up dynamically, so there's no need to
install a database. All maintenance and administration can be performed through
your web browser, making Pebble ideal for anybody who is constantly on the move
or doesn't have direct access to their host.
