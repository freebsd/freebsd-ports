LWP::UserAgent is the default module for issuing HTTP requests from
Perl. It has a keep_alive setting which by default allows unlimited
requests to the same server. Some servers will disconnect you after
a limited number of requests (in Apache 2 this is achieved with the
MaxKeepAliveRequests directive). This module allows you to limit
the maximum number of keep alive requests to a server.
