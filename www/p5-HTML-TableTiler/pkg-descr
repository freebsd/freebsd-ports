HTML::TableTiler uses a minimum HTML table as a tile to generate a complete
HTML table from a bidimensional array of data. It can easily produce simple or
complex graphic styled tables with minimum effort and maximum speed.

Think about the table tile as a sort of tile that automatically expands itself
to contain the whole data. You can control the final look of a table by
choosing either the HORIZONTAL and the VERTICAL tiling mode among:
PULL, TILE and TRIM.

The main advantages to use it are:

* automatic table generation

* complex graphic patterns generation without coding

* simple to maintain
