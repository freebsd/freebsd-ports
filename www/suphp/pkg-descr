suPHP is a combination of an Apache module (mod_suphp) and an
executable which provides a wrapper for PHP. With both
together, it is possible to execute PHP scripts with the
permissions of their owner without having to place a PHP
binary in each user's cgi-bin directory. suPHP doesn't need
Apache's suExec, provides a logging function and support for
different php.ini's.
