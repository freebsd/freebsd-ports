Using suPHP can break some PHP-scripts, because of Apache's CGI
interface.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------
For those migrating from suPHP 0.5.x, be aware there are many
changes since 0.6.x that can cause your current Apache environment
to stop working or behave oddly.  Here are two migration tips:

suPHP now uses a configuration file for runtime configuration.
The file is located at:

        /usr/local/etc/suphp.conf

...but *has not* been created for you.  A sample configuration
file has been installed here:

        /usr/local/etc/suphp.conf-example

This means that many of the make.conf(5) knobs for the
www/suphp port are no longer used, and are modifiable in
real-time; thus, things like WITHOUT_CHECKPATH and SUPHP_PATH
are no longer needed.  Instead, edit the config file.

Equally as important, suPHP no longer uses a static MIME type
for determining what content get handled by suPHP.  In 0.5.x,
you used the following Apache directives:

        suPHP_Engine on
        AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
        AddHandler x-httpd-php .php

Since suPHP 0.6.x, you should use the following:

        suPHP_Engine on
        AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
        suPHP_AddHandler application/x-httpd-php

Otherwise, Apache will begin serving PHP files as downloadable
content, rather than parse them with the PHP interpreter.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------
For those versions upgraded from 0.6.x to 0.7.x. There are some
new features and changes for the configuration file:

    - Multiple path (with patterns) & variable substitution
      support for docroots
    - Double-quoted strings at section '[handlers]'
      ex. application/x-httpd-php="php:/usr/local/bin/php-cgi"

These changes may lead to internal server error if without
modifications of the configuration file from previous version.
