The Hiawatha Monitor is a monitoring tool for the Hiawatha web
server.  It can be used to keep track of the performance and security
of all your Hiawatha web servers via one single interface.  It is
not a replacement for analytics software or the local logfiles, but
it gives you a quick and easy overview of how your web servers are
performing and which ones require some attention.

The Hiawatha Monitor is a PHP web application with a MySQL database
backend.  It requires the cron daemon for periodic downloading of
statistical information from the web servers it monitors.
