GNU Wget2 is the successor of GNU Wget, a file and recursive website
downloader.

Designed and written from scratch it wraps around libwget, that
provides the basic functions needed by a web client.

Wget2 works multi-threaded and uses many features to allow fast
operation.

In many cases Wget2 downloads much faster than Wget1.x due to HTTP2,
HTTP compression, parallel connections and use of If-Modified-Since
HTTP header.
