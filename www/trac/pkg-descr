Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project management.
Our mission; to help developers write great software while staying out of
the way.  Trac should impose as little as possible on a team's established
development process and policies.

All aspects of Trac have been designed with one single goal, to simplify
tracking and communication of software issues, enhancements and monitoring
overall progress. 

What is Trac?

    * An integrated system for managing software projects
    * An enhanced wiki
    * A flexible web-based issue tracker
    * An interface to the Subversion revision control system

At the core of Trac lies an integrated wiki and issue/bug database.  Using
wiki markup, all objects managed by Trac can directly link to other
issues/bug reports, code changesets, documentation and files.
