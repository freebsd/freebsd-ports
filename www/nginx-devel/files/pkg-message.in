===================================================================
Recent version of the NGINX introduces dynamic modules support.  In
FreeBSD ports tree this feature was enabled by default with the DSO
knob.  Several vendor's and third-party modules have been converted
to dynamic modules.  Unset the DSO knob builds an NGINX without
dynamic modules support.

To load a module at runtime, include the new `load_module'
directive in the main context, specifying the path to the shared
object file for the module, enclosed in quotation marks.  When you
reload the configuration or restart NGINX, the module is loaded in.
It is possible to specify a path relative to the source directory,
or a full path, please see
https://www.nginx.com/blog/dynamic-modules-nginx-1-9-11/ and
http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#load_module for
details.

Default path for the NGINX dynamic modules is

%%PREFIX%%/libexec/nginx.
