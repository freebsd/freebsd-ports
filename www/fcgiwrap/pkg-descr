fcgiwrap is a simple server for running CGI applications over FastCGI. It hopes
to provide clean CGI support to Nginx (and other web servers that may need it).

Features:
    * very lightweight (84KB of private memory per instance)
    * fixes broken CR/LF in headers
    * handles environment in a sane way (CGI scripts get HTTP-related env. vars
    * from FastCGI parameters and inherit all the others from fcgiwrap's
    * environment)
    * no configuration, so you can run several sites off the same fcgiwrap pool
    * passes CGI stderr output to fcgiwrap's stderr (this is by design but
    * stderr could be also passed to FastCGI stderr stream)
