========================================================================

Please note that this port/package overrides the default installation layout
for Graphite! To setup graphite, you will need to:

* Set the SECRET_KEY in %%PREFIX%%/etc/graphite/local_settings.py

* Initialize the sqlite user database and create the admin user:

	python2 %%PYTHON_SITELIBDIR%%/graphite/manage.py syncdb

* Build the index:

        %%PREFIX%%/bin/build-index.sh

* Change the ownership of the user database so the webapp can write to it:

	chown -R %%WWWOWN%%:%%WWWGRP%% /var/db/graphite/ /var/log/graphite/

* Setup a web server:

Setup Apache by creating a vhost similar to the following:

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName graphite
	DocumentRoot "%%DATADIR%%/content/"

	# I've found that an equal number of processes & threads tends
	# to show the best performance for Graphite (ymmv).
	WSGIDaemonProcess graphite processes=5 threads=5 inactivity-timeout=120 display-name=graphite
	WSGIProcessGroup graphite
	WSGIApplicationGroup graphite
        WSGIImportScript %%PREFIX%%/etc/graphite/graphite.wsgi process-group=graphite application-group=graphite

	# XXX You will need to create this file! There is a graphite.wsgi.example
	# file in this directory that you can safely use, just copy it to graphite.wgsi
	WSGIScriptAlias / %%PREFIX%%/etc/graphite/graphite.wsgi

	Alias /content/ %%DATADIR%%/content/
	<Location "/content/">
		SetHandler None
	</Location>

	# XXX In order for the django admin site media to work you
	# must change @DJANGO_ROOT@ to be the path to your django
	# installation, which is probably something like:
	# /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/django
	#Alias /media/ "@DJANGO_ROOT@/contrib/admin/media/"
	Alias /media/ %%PYTHON_SITELIBDIR%%/django
	<Location "/media/">
		SetHandler None
	</Location>

	Alias /static/ "%%PYTHON_SITELIBDIR%%/django/contrib/admin/static/"
	<Location "/static/">
		SetHandler None
	</Location>
	<Directory "%%PYTHON_SITELIBDIR%%/django/contrib/admin/static/">
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from all
		Require all granted
	</Directory>

	# The graphite.wsgi file has to be accessible by apache. It won't
	# be visible to clients because of the DocumentRoot though.
	<Directory %%PREFIX%%/etc/graphite/>
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from all
		Require all granted
	</Directory>

	<Directory %%DATADIR%%/content/>
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from all
		Require all granted
	</Directory>

</VirtualHost>

Now you should be able to access the graphite virtual host you created in the
first step.
