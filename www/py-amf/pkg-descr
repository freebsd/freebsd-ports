PyAMF provides Action Message Format (AMF) support for Python that is
compatible with the Flash Player.

The Adobe Integrated Runtime and Flash Player use AMF to communicate between
an application and a remote server. AMF encodes remote procedure calls (RPC)
into a compact binary representation that can be transferred over HTTP/HTTPS
or the RTMP/RTMPS protocol. Objects and data values are serialized into this
binary format, which increases performance, allowing applications to load data
up to 10 times faster than with text-based formats such as XML or SOAP.

AMF3, the default serialization for ActionScript 3.0, provides various
advantages over AMF0, which is used for ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0. AMF3 sends
data over the network more efficiently than AMF0. AMF3 supports sending int
and uint objects as integers and supports data types that are available only
in ActionScript 3.0, such as ByteArray, ArrayCollection, and IExternalizable.
