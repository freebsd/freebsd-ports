HTML::Breadcrumbs
=================

HTML::Breadcrumbs is a module used to create HTML 'breadcrumb trails'
i.e. an ordered set of html links locating the current page within
a hierarchy.

HTML::Breadcrumbs splits the given path up into a list of elements,
derives labels to use for each of these elements, and then renders
this list as N-1 links using the derived label, with the final
element being just a label.

Both procedural and object-oriented interfaces are provided. The OO
interface is useful if you want to separate object creation and
initialisation from rendering or display, or for subclassing.

Both interfaces allow you to munge the path in various ways, to set
labels either explicitly via a hashref or via a callback subroutine,
and to control the formatting of elements via sprintf patterns or a
callback subroutine.
