Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex,
pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design,
directly in your markup.

This gem gives access to the standard Tailwind CSS framework configured for dark
mode, forms, aspect-ratio, typography, and the Inter font via the asset pipeline
using Sprockets (and soon Propshaft).
