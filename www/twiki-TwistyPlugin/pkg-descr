A "twisty" is an interface toggle control to show and hide content.

TwistyPlugin gives you several options to control the appearance of a
twisty:

* use link text or buttons
* position an icon left or right
* remember the state at the next visit of the page
* start the Twisty open or closed
* start the Twisty open or closed for the first visit
* use a span or div for the content
* set a class for the content span or div
