WebKitGTK+ is a full-featured port of the WebKit rendering engine, suitable
for projects requiring any kind of web integration, from hybrid HTML/CSS
applications to full-fledged web browsers. It offers WebKit's full
functionality and is useful in a wide range of systems from desktop
computers to embedded systems like phones, tablets, and televisions.

WebKitGTK+ is made by a lively community of developers and designers,
who hope to bring the web platform to everyone. It's the official web
engine of the GNOME platform and is used in browsers such as Epiphany
and Midori.
