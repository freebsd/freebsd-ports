This module provides a interface between HTML::Mason and Apache::Session, in
effect, providing full session and cooking handling from within HTML::Mason.

When run under the ApacheHandler module, this module attempts to first use
Apache::Cookie for cookie-handling.  Otherwise it uses CGI::Cookie as a
fallback.

This module accepts quite a number of parameters, most of which are simply
passed through to Apache::Session.  For this reason, you are advised to
familiarize yourself with the Apache::Session documentation before
attempting to configure this module.

Use 'perldoc MasonX::Request::WithApacheSession' for information on how to
use the module.
