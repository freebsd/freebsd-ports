=== INSTALLATION ===

Jetty is now installed in %%APP_HOME%%

From Jetty 9, the way to configure it has changed. You are **strongly**
advised to read the documentation found here:

http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/

Please pay particular attention to HOME and BASE documentation, i.e.,:

http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/startup-base-and-home.html

You may want to activate it in /etc/rc.conf:

    # echo %%APP_NAME%%_enable="YES" >> /etc/rc.conf

A sample configuration file can be found here:

    %%ETCDIR%%/%%APP_NAME%%.sample

Please modify it to suit your needs, paying particular attention
to the value of JETTY_HOME and JETTY_BASE.

Once you are happy with the configuration file, you can start Jetty:

    # service %%APP_NAME%% start

Once Jetty is started, point your web browser to the default home page at
http://localhost:8080/.

A demo web app is installed for your convenience.

== ADVANCED USAGE ==

If you need to pass special options to Java/Jetty, please set the appropriate
variables in the configuration file, e.g.,

  # Increase memory limit of the Java virtual machine

  JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xms32m -Xmx256m"

  # Run Java with remote debugging turned on on port 8186

  JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8186"

More configuration options are presented in the sample file.

== DEINSTALLATION ==

If, when, Jetty is removed, you can safely delete this directory:

    %%WWWDIR%%

Enjoy!
