Gauche-makiki is a simple multithreaded HTTP server intended for applications
that want to provide HTTP server capability easily.  The main functionalities
are available by just one file, `makiki.scm', so you can either install it as
an ordinary Gauche extension library, or you can just copy the file into your
application.

You'll get the idea by looking at the minimal server:

    (use makiki)
    (define (main args) (start-http-server :port 6789))
    (define-http-handler "/"
      (^[req app] (respond/ok req "<h1>It worked!</h1>")))
