Hiawatha is an advanced and secure webserver for Unix. It has been written with
'being secure' as its main goal. Hiawatha has many security features that no
other webserver has. Besides being very secure, it's also a very fast webserver.
It's twice as fast as Apache for static content. It supports load-balanced
FastCGI, which makes it fast and scalable for serving CGI.
