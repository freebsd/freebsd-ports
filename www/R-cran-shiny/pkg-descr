Shiny makes it super simple for R users like you to turn analyses
into interactive web applications that anyone can use. Let your
users choose input parameters using friendly controls like sliders,
drop-downs, and text fields. Easily incorporate any number of outputs
like plots, tables, and summaries.

No HTML or JavaScript knowledge is necessary. If you have some
experience with R, youre just minutes away from combining the
statistical power of R with the simplicity of a web page.
