chklinks is a Perl link checker. It helps finding broken links on your
website.

chklinks differs from linkchecker in that chklinks is non- threaded. It does
not raises many simultaneously connections for its job. It won't run out of
the resources and crash your system in a moment. This is certainly more
desirable for most webmasters and users.
