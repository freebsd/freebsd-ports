## Missing features

Some features found on Windows, macOS and Linux are not implemented:

- Encrypted Media Extensions (requires Widevine CDM binary)
- Process sandboxing (requires Capsicum backend)
- Reduced memory usage (requires mozjemalloc)
- Crash Reporter (requires Google Breakpad and reproducible builds)
- WebVR (requires open source runtime)
- TCP fast open
- `about:networking` (requires link state notification)

## Audio backend

Currently used audio backend can be inspected on `about:support` page.
Supported backends and default probing order is as follows:
- `pulse-rust` if `pulseaudio` package is installed (PULSEAUDIO option)
- `jack` if `jackit` package is installed (JACK option)
- `sndio` if `sndio` package is installed (SNDIO option)
- `alsa` if `alsa-lib` package is installed (ALSA option)
- `oss` (always available)
To force a specific backend open `about:config` page and create
`media.cubeb.backend` preference.

Microphone selection only works in `oss`, `pulse`, `pulse-rust` backends.
Other backends are limited to `default` which is usually `/dev/dsp`,
so use virtual_oss to reroute microphones from non-default devices.

## Gamepad API

Requires evdev(4) joystick support. On FreeBSD 13.0 enable hgame(4)
while older versions can use sysutils/iichid or multimedia/webcamd.

## smb:// issues
Network group, machine, and share browsing does not work correctly.

## sftp://
Only sftp access using public key authentication works. To easily
setup public key authentication to `remote_host`:

    $ ssh-keygen
    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_host "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

The SSH server on `remote_host` must allow pub key authentication.
