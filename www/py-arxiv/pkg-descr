arxiv.py is a Python wrapper for the arXiv API
(http://arxiv.org/help/api/index).

arXiv is a project by the Cornell University Library that provides open access
to 1,000,000+ articles in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative
Biology, Quantitative Finance, and Statistics.

They have an API that uses ATOM feeds to serve simple database queries.
Unfortunately, handling these ATOM requsts can be clumsy (especially given
inconsistency in data between different result objects, even in the same query).
This is where arxiv.py comes it: it constructs requests for arXiv and gets ATOM
feeds via a simple handful of methods, and parses the results into an intuitive
format.
