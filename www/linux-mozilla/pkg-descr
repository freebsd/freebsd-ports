This is the Mozilla suite (Web browser, HTML editor, mail user
agent, news reader, address book, and IRC client) pre-compiled for
Linux.  The Linux version is necessary for running plugins which
are only available as Linux binaries.

The maintainer has observed that when linux_base-62 is installed,
text sometimes cannot be typed into the dialogs for saving files,
for searching within a document, or in ChatZilla.

This port is compatible with the www/linuxflashplugin port and with
the Flash and Java plugins from the www/linux-netscape6 port.

For the maintainer, the Java plugin from Netscape 6 does not work
when linux_base-7 is installed, but does work under linux_base-61
or linux_base-62.  Your mileage may vary.
