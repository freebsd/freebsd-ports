          o MT-safe
          o streaming POST (POST with File/IO)
          o Digest auth
          o Negotiate/NTLM auth for WWW-Authenticate (requires net/htlm module)
          o NTLM auth for Proxy-Authenticate (requires Win32/sspi module)
          o extensible with filter interface
          o you dont have to care HTTP/1.1 persistent connection (httpclient cares instead of you)

          o Cache
          o Rather advanced HTTP/1.1 usage such as Range, deflate, etc. (of course you can set it in header by yourself)
