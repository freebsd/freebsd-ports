Google App Engine software development kit (SDK).

Google App Engine enables you to build web applications
on the same scalable systems that power Google applications.
Google App Engine applications are implemented using the PHP
or the Python programming language. The runtime environment
includes the full Python language and most of the Python
standard library.

App Engine applications are easy to build, easy to maintain,
and easy to scale as your traffic and data storage needs grow.
With App Engine, there are no servers to maintain: you just
upload your application, and it's ready to serve your users.
