CGI::XMLApplication is a CGI application class, that intends to enable
perl artists to implement CGIs that make use of XML/XSLT functionality,
without taking too much care about specialized errorchecking or even
care too much about XML itself. It provides the power of the
XML::LibXML/XML::LibXSLT module package for content deliverment.

As well CGI::XMLApplication is designed to support project management on
code level. The class allows to split web applications into several
simple parts. Through this most of the code stays simple and easy to
maintain. Throughout the whole lifetime of a script CGI::XMLApplication
tries to keep the application stable. As well a programmer has not to
bother about some of XML::LibXML/XML::LibXSLT transformation pitfalls.
