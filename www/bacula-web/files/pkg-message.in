Please note that everything has been installed in %%WWWDIR%%.

  cd %%WWWDIR%% && composer i

Create inital user:
  su -m www -c "cd %%WWWDIR%% && php bwc setupauth"

Make sure you modify %%WWWDIR%%/application/config/config.php to your needs.
The installed config.php should work with the standard setup already.
Use the manual as a reference:
http://docs.bacula-web.org/en/v8.3.3/02_install/configure.html

Depending on the webserver you use,
you will probably want to add an alias to your httpd.conf file, something
like this:

	Alias /bacula-web "%%WWWDIR%%/"

And restart Apache.
