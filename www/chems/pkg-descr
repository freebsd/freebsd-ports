CHeMS is a free (as in freedom) modular code-driven content helper
management system (the first!) written in PHP fully compliant with
the XHTML 1.1 and CSS2 standards. One of its main purpose is to help
developers and (not so) advanced users to easily setting up a web
application (blog, site, etc.) without have to deal with the "boring"
side of this process such as layout generation code, menu blocks and
so on. Its modularization system allow to mantain a light and fast core
which only have to generate the layout and load the modules to delegate
all the real and hard work to them. You never have to learn new weird
APIs in order to deal with the CHeMS internals, there is full controll.
That's why CHeMS is not a Content Management System (CMS) but rather it's
an assistant.
