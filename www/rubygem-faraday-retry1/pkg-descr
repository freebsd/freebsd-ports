The Retry middleware automatically retries requests that fail due to
intermittent client or server errors (such as network hiccups). By default, it
retries 2 times and handles only timeout exceptions. It can be configured with
an arbitrary number of retries, a list of exceptions to handle, a retry
interval, a percentage of randomness to add to the retry interval, and a backoff
factor. The middleware can also handle the Retry-After header automatically when
configured with the right status codes.
