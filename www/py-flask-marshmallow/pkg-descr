Flask-Marshmallow is a thin integration layer for Flask (a Python web
framework) and marshmallow (an object serialization/deserialization
library) that adds additional features to marshmallow, including URL and
Hyperlinks fields for HATEOAS-ready APIs. It also (optionally)
integrates with Flask-SQLAlchemy.
