WebService::Validator::HTML::W3C provides access to the W3Cs online HTML
validator. It's nothing to do with the W3C so pleas don't report any problems
with it to them. Also, please use it wisely and don't abuse the W3Cs
validator service. If you need to do a lot of validation consider
downloading and installing the Validator on your own machine.
