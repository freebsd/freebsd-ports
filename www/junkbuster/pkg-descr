This is a port of The Internet Junkbuster Proxy(TM).  An excelent way
to enhance your privacy while browsing the web.  And it also happens
to do a great job of filtering out all those annoying banner ads!

This modified version allows one to specify appearance of blocked GIFs.
It can automatically compress text/html and text/plain documents for clients
which support Accept-Encoding: gzip (e.g. Netscape 4.7, Internet Explorer 5,
Lynx 2.8.3) to save downstream modem/network bandwidth.  It uses the zlib
compression library to perform on-the-fly compression of HTML documents.
