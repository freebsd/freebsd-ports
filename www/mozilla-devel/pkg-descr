This is the open source web browser, which forms the basis for
Netscape Navigator 6.  It should be fully compliant with all W3C
standards, including HTML, CSS, XML, XSL, JavaScript, MathML,
SVG and RDF.  This version also supports SSL encryption, but
does not yet support Java.

While the code is officially still in pre-release, the browser
is mostly stable, and does a good job displaying most pages on
the web.  Mail and News also work, and provide some interesting
features, such as the ability to check multiple POP3 servers.

Testers are most welcome, but should submit bug reports about
the browser itself to mozilla.org (http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/)
rather than via FreeBSD.
