This is the current release of the Mozilla open source web browser. It should 
be fully compliant with all W3C standards, including HTML, CSS, XML, XSL, 
JavaScript, MathML, SVG and RDF.  This version also supports SSL encryption, 
and Java with the use of the FreeBSD native Java plug-in.

This is the latest bleeding edge release.  Beware that you'll probably find
bugs here, so if you value stability, try www/mozilla or www/mozilla-vendor.
