POST-INSTALL CONFIGURATION FOR e107
=====================================

1) Create a user and a database for e107 to store all
   its tables in (or choose an existing database).

2) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   For Apache versions earlier than 2.4:

   Alias /e107 %%PREFIX%%/%%E107DIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%E107DIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

   For Apache version 2.4.x or above:

   Alias /e107 %%PREFIX%%/%%E107DIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%PREFIX%%/%%E107DIR%%/>
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
   </Directory>

3) Visit your e107 site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/e107/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up e107, creating an admin account, etc.
