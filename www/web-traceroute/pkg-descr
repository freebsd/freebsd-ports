This is a modified BSD traceroute command which outputs customized HTML 
and can be used as a cgi program directly.

The advantage of using a compiled C program directly instead of a shell, 
tcl or perl scipt: 

More Secure (tastes better) - There is no possibility that strange 
characters or environment passed to the CGI program can be used to break 
into the server, etc. 

Less Overhead (less filling) - The whole CGI program runs as one very 
small process instead of multiple script processes and/or a large perl 
program which must be interpreted each time it is run. 

You can customise the HTML presented, by creating the template file 
"template.html", and entering it's full path when prompted. Insert the 
text "TRACEROUTE-OUTPUT" into your template file at the point where you 
require the traceroute results displayed. This makes web-traceroute 
integrate seamlessly with existing website layouts.
