Sekizai means "blocks" in Japanese, and that's what this app provides.
A fresh look at blocks.  With django-sekizai you can define
placeholders where your blocks get rendered and at different places in
your templates append to those blocks.  This is especially useful for
css and javascript.  Your subtemplates can now define css and
javscript files to be included, and the css will be nicely put at the
top and the javascript to the bottom, just like you should.  Also
sekizai will ignore any duplicate content in a single block.
