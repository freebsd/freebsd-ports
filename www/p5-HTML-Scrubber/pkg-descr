HTML::Scrubber - Perl extension for scrubbing/sanitizing html. If you wanna
"scrub" or "sanitize" html input in a reliable an flexible fashion, then
this module is for you.

When a tag is encountered, HTML::Scrubber allows/denies the tag using the
explicit rule if one exists. If no explicit rule exists, Scrubber applies
the default rule. If an explicit rule exists, but it's a simple rule(1),
the default attribute rule is applied.
