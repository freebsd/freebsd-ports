Rolo is a flexible framework and library to build HTTP-based server applications
beyond microservices and REST APIs. You can build HTTP-based RPC servers,
websocket proxies, or other server types that typical web frameworks are not
designed for.

Rolo extends Werkzeug, a flexible Python HTTP server library, for you to use
concepts you are familiar with like Router, Request, Response, or @route. It
introduces the concept of a Gateway and HandlerChain, an implementation variant
of the chain-of-responsibility pattern.

Rolo is designed for environments that do not use asyncio, but still require
asynchronous HTTP features like HTTP2 SSE or Websockets. To allow asynchronous
communication, Rolo introduces an ASGI/WSGI bridge, that allows you to serve
Rolo applications through ASGI servers like Hypercorn.
