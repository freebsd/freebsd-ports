The Net::Amazon::AWIS module allows you to use the Amazon Alexa Web
Information Service.

The Alexa Web Information Service (AWIS) provides developers with
programmatic access to the information Alexa Internet (www.alexa.com)
collects from its Web Crawl, which currently encompasses more than 100
terabytes of data from over 4 billion Web pages. Developers and Web
site owners can use AWIS as a platform for finding answers to
difficult and interesting problems on the Web, and incorporating them
into their Web applications.

In order to access the Alexa Web Information Service, you will need an
Amazon Web Services Subscription ID. See
http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html

Registered developers have free access to the Alexa Web Information
Service during its beta period, but it is limited to 10,000 requests
per subscription ID per day.

There are some limitations, so be sure to read The Amazon Alexa
Web Information Service FAQ.
