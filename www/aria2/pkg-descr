aria2 has a segmented downloading engine in its core. Therefore, it
can download files a lot faster than ordinary browsers. Currently it
has following features:
* HTTP/HTTPS GET support
* HTTP Proxy support
* HTTP BASIC authentication support
* HTTP Proxy authentication support
* FTP support (active, passive mode)
* FTP through HTTP proxy (GET command or tunneling)
* Segmented download
* Cookie support (currently aria2 ignores "expires")
* It can run as a daemon process
* BitTorrent protocol support with fast extension
* Selective download in multi-file torrent
* Metalink version 3.0 support (HTTP/FTP/BitTorrent)
* Limiting download/upload speed
