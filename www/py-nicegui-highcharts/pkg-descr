NiceGUI Highcharts is an extension for NiceGUI, an easy-to-use,
Python-based UI framework. It provides a 'highchart' element based
on Highcharts, the popular JavaScript charting library. Due to
Highcharts' restrictive license, this element is not part of the
NiceGUI package anymore, but can be install separately.
