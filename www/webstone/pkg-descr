The WebStone benchmark tests were originally developed by Silicon Graphics
to measure the performance of Web server software and hardware products.
WebStone 2.0.1 is a more portable version of the original WebStone
benchmark which added support to use Windows NT systems as client test
systems.

Mindcraft, Inc. has acquired the rights to WebStone from Silicon Graphics.
WebStone 2.5 is Mindcraft's enhancement to WebStone 2.0.1 to improve
reliability and portability as well as to make tests more reproducible.
WebStone 2.5 also offers new workloads for CGI and API tests (see below
for more details). WebStone 2.5 provides performance-identical test
results with WebStone 2.0.1 when using the same workloads

This FreeBSD port rely on rsh and rcp being allowed for the user proces
running webstone between the web server and web clients. This is not
enable per default in FreeBSD, and root is never allowed to do it without
entering password for each operation.
