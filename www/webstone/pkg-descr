WebStone is an open benchmark proposal to the server industry. It is
designed to measure the performance of HTTP servers under multiple
scenarios which reflect different Web site profiles. 

The original WebStone benchmark was released in March, 1995. The original
white paper describing this benchmark is available from
http://www.sgi.com/Products/WebFORCE/WebStone/.

WebStone is not a proprietary benchmark - it is an open benchmark. The
source code is freely available, and anyone can examine it. By design,
WebStone does not unfairly favor SGI, Netscape, or any other company - it
is simply a performance measurement tool.

This FreeBSD port rely on rsh and rcp being allowed for the user proces
running webstone between the web server and web clients. This is not
enable per default in FreeBSD, and root is never allowed to do it without
entering password for each operation.
