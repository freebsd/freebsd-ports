Drood is a lightweight, partially-compliant HTTP/1.1 server, intended as an
alternative to more complex web servers for websites where the server
requirements are simple.  Drood supports name-based virtual hosting, CGI
and SCGI, gzipped content-encoding for static resources, and will service
both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.
