     o You can find the configuration files for this package in the
       directory %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid.

     o The default cache directory is /var/squid/cache/.
       The default log directory is /var/log/squid/.

       Note:
       You must initialize new cache directories before you can start
       squid.  Do this by running "squid -z" as 'root' or 'squid'.
       If your cache directories are already initialized (e.g. after an
       upgrade of squid) you do not need to initialize them again.

     o When using DiskD storage scheme remember to read documentation:
         http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/DiskDaemon
       and alter your kern.ipc defaults in /boot/loader.conf. DiskD will not
       work reliably without this. Last recomendations were:

         kern.ipc.msgmnb=8192
         kern.ipc.msgssz=64
         kern.ipc.msgtql=2048

     o The default configuration will deny everyone but the local host and
       local networks as defined in RFC 1918 for IPv4 and RFCs 4193 and
       4291 for IPv6 access to the proxy service.  Edit the "http_access
       allow/deny" directives in %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid/squid.conf
       to suit your needs.

     o If AUTH_SQL option is set, please, don't forget to install one of
       following perl modules depending on database you like:
         databases/p5-DBD-mysql
         databases/p5-DBD-Pg
         databases/p5-DBD-SQLite

     To enable Squid, set squid_enable=yes in either
     /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf.d/squid
     Please see %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/squid for further details.

     Note:
     If you just updated your Squid installation from an earlier version,
     make sure to check your Squid configuration against the 3.4 default
     configuration file %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid/squid.conf.sample.

     %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid/squid.conf.documented is a fully annotated
     configuration file you can consult for further reference.

     Additionally, you should check your configuration by calling
     'squid -f /path/to/squid.conf -k parse' before starting Squid.
