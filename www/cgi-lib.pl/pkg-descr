The cgi-lib.pl library makes CGI scripting in Perl easy enough for
anyone to process forms and create dynamic Web content. The library has
the following features: 

* Extremely simple to learn and easy to use 
* Designed for operation under Perl5 and Perl4 
* Very efficient 
* Compatibility with all CGI interactions, including File Upload 
* Convenient utility functions 
* Compatible with Perl5 security features such as taint, warnings,
  (command line options -Tw) and use strict; 
* Debugging facilities 
* Good starting point for migration to more sophisticated libraries
