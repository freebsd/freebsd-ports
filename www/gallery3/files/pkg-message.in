*****************************************************************
Before using Gallery 3, you will need to configure your database.
Full instructions are available here:

  http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery3:Tutorials:Installation

If you are using MySQL, here's the short version of the instructions:

  1. Create a new database:
  $ mysqladmin -uroot create gallery3

  2. Grant access to the database:
  $ mysql -uroot -e"GRANT ALL ON gallery3.* TO USERNAME@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD'" gallery3
  (choose your own values for USERNAME and PASSWORD)

You will also need to configure Apache.  Consider adding the following
to your httpd.conf:

     Alias /gallery3 "%%WWWDIR%%"

    <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%">
        AllowOverride Options FileInfo
	Allow from all
    </Directory>

Then restart Apache: 'apachectl graceful'

Please visit 'http://localhost/gallery3/' in a
web-browser and follow the configuration instructions.

Upgrading: http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery3:Upgrading

Note: You can upgrade from Beta 1, 2 or 3 (but not from earlier releases -- sorry!)

Upgrading is really easy! Unpack the new version on top of the old one to replace the existing files
and then either browse to:

	http://example.com/gallery3/index.php/upgrader

(except use your real domain name) or if you have shell access, run:

	php index.php upgrade
