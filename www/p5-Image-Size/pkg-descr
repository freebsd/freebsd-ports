The Image::Size library is based upon the wwwis script written by Alex Knowles
(alex@ed.ac.uk), a tool to examine HTML and add 'width' and 'height' parameters
to image tags. The sizes are cached internally based on file name, so multiple
calls on the same file name (such as images used in bulleted lists, for
example) do not result in repeated computations.
