Nostromo aka nhttpd is a simple, fast and secure HTTP server. It
runs as a single process, handling connections with select(2). For
CGIs and directory listing it does fork(2). The minimum of HTTP/1.1
and CGI/1.1 are implemented. Also supported are: chroot, setuid,
basic authentication, SSL, IPv6, custom responses, aliases, and
virtual hosts. The access log is written in standard CLF format.
