The HTTP Gem is an easy-to-use client library for making requests from Ruby. It
uses a simple method chaining system for building requests, similar to Python's
Requests

Under the hood, The HTTP Gem uses http_parser.rb, a fast HTTP parsing native
extension based on the Node.js parser and a Java port thereof.
