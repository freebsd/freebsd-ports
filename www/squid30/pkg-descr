FreeBSD PORTER'S NOTES. To this moment, Squid is poorly documented.
But you aren't lost in space: there is a mailing list,
<squid-users@nlanr.net>, where you will find some support and help.
I also _strongly_ suggest you to examine Web pages noticed above.
If you have comments/questions/suggestions about FreeBSD port -- ask
me.  Andrew Stesin.
