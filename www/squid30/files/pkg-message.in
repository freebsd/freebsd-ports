     o You can find the configuration files for this package in the
       directory %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid.

     o The default cache directory is /var/squid/cache.
       The default log directory is /var/squid/logs.

       Note:
       You must initialize new cache directories before you can start
       squid.  Do this by running "squid -z" as 'root' or '%%SQUID_UID%%'.
       If your cache directories are already initialized (e.g. after an
       upgrade of squid) you do not need to initialize them again.

     o The default configuration will deny everyone but local networks
       as defined in RFC 1918 access to the proxy service.
       Edit the "http_access allow/deny" directives in
       %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid/squid.conf to suit your needs.

     To enable Squid, set squid_enable=yes in either
     /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or /etc/rc.conf.d/squid
     Please see %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/squid for further details.

     Note:
     If you just updated your Squid installation from an earlier version,
     make sure to check your Squid configuration against the 3.0 default
     configuration file %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid/squid.conf.default.

     Additionally, you should check your configuration by calling
     'squid -f /path/to/squid.conf -k parse' before starting Squid.
