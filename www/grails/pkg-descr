Grails aims to bring the "coding by convention" paradigm to Groovy. It's an
open-source web application framework that leverages the Groovy language and
complements Java Web development. You can use Grails as a standalone
development environment that hides all configuration details or integrate your
Java business logic. Grails aims to make development as simple as possible and
hence should appeal to a wide range of developers not just those from the
Java community.
