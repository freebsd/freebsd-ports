          **** NOTE ****

First, Add the following line to your httpd.conf:

Alias /%%BBLOGURL%%/ "%%PREFIX%%/%%BBLOGDIR%%"

For first use of bBLog, remember to point your browser to

http://localhost/%%BBLOGURL%%/install.php

At the end of the install when the config file is written to disk, you
should change the permissions back to 755 so it is not writable by the
webserver.
