bBlog is a blogging program written in OOP style PHP. Major features include
threaded comments and trackback support. It is designed from the ground up
to use the Smarty templating engine. It has unparalleled extendability and
versility.

Perhaps bBlog's most distinctive feature is that it is built around a
templating system called Smarty, which makes customizing your blog as easy
as editing any web page, no programming skills required.
