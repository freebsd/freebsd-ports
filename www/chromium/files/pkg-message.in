For correct operation, shared memory support has to be enabled
in Chromium by performing the following command as root:

    # sysctl kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1

To preserve this setting across reboots, append the following
to /etc/sysctl.conf:

    kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1

FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE and newer have this set by default.

Chromium has a known problem of hanging tabs. The bug has been fixed
in r337328. Therefore, it is recommended to upgrade the system after
the correction date.

    # svn diff -c337328 --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base
