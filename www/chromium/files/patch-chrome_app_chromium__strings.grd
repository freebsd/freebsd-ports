           The profile appears to be in use by another Chromium process (<ph name="PROCESS_ID">$1<ex>12345</ex></ph>) on another computer (<ph name="HOST_NAME">$2<ex>example.com</ex></ph>). Chromium has locked the profile so that it doesn't get corrupted. If you are sure no other processes are using this profile, you can unlock the profile and relaunch Chromium.
