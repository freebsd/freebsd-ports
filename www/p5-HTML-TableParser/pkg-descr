HTML::TableParser uses HTML::Parser to extract data from an HTML table. The
data is returned via a series of user defined callback functions or methods.
Specific tables may be selected either by a matching a unique table id or by
matching against the column names. Multiple (even nested) tables may be
parsed in a document in one pass.
