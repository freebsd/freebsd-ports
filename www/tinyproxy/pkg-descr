Tinyproxy is a light-weight HTTP/HTTPS proxy daemon for POSIX operating systems.
Designed from the ground up to be fast and yet small, it is an ideal solution
for use cases such as embedded deployments where a full featured HTTP proxy is
required, but the system resources for a larger proxy are unavailable.

Note that tinyproxy requires configuration to run in anonymizing mode. See
tinyproxy.conf.sample for detail.
