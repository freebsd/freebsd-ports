Tinyproxy is a light-weight HTTP/HTTPS proxy daemon for POSIX
operating systems. Designed from the ground up to be fast and yet
small, it is an ideal solution for use cases such as embedded
deployments where a full featured HTTP proxy is required, but the
system resources for a larger proxy are unavailable.

Note that tinyproxy requires configuration to run in anonymizing
mode. See tinyproxy.conf.sample for detail.
