Tinyproxy is a lightweight, non-caching,optionally anonymizing http proxy.
It is designed to consume a minimum of system resources.
It listens on a given TCP port and handles HTTP proxy requests.

Note that tinyproxy requires commandline arguments to run in anonymizing
mode. For most people, "/usr/local/sbin/tinyproxy -a Host: -a Authorization:"
is sufficient for an anonymizing proxy.
