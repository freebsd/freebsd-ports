tinyproxy is a GPLed, lightweight HTTP proxy. Designed from the ground up to be
fast and yet small, it is an ideal solution for sites where a full-featured
HTTP proxy is required, but the system resources required to run a more
demanding HTTP proxy are unavailable. tinyproxy is fully compatible with all
existing web browsers, and has a number of useful features including
anonymous mode.

Note that tinyproxy requires configuration to run in anonymizing
mode. See tinyproxy.conf.sample for detail.
