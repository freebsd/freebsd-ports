django-sudo provides an extra layer of security for after a user is already
logged in. Views can be decorated with @sudo_required, and then a user must
re-enter their password to view that page. After verifying their password, that
user has elevated permissions for the duration of SUDO_COOKIE_AGE. This
duration is independent of the normal session duration allowing short elevated
permission durations, but retain long user sessions.
