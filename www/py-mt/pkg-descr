PyMT is a simple Python module which allows you to easily connect to a Movable
Type weblog, using it's built in XML-RPC API. PyMT is capable of handling every
MT call available.

This interface allows you to access most of the core functionality of Movable
Type, including the ability to view, post, delete and edit weblog entries,
fetch user information, apply categories to your posts and get information
about trackback pings. Every XML-RPC method is accessed using a PyMT method
with exactly the same name. PyMT is basically just a light wrapper, which
hides the xml-rpc part of the work.
