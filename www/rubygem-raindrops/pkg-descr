Raindrops is a real-time stats toolkit to show statistics for Rack HTTP
servers. It is designed for preforking servers such as Rainbows! and Unicorn,
but should support any Rack HTTP server under Ruby 1.9, 1.8 and Rubinius on
platforms supporting POSIX shared memory. It may also be used as a generic
scoreboard for sharing atomic counters across multiple processes.
