Mason is a powerful Perl-based templating system, designed to generate dynamic
content of all kinds.

Unlike many templating systems, Mason does not attempt to invent an alternate,
"easier" syntax for templates. It provides a set of syntax and features specific
to template creation, but underneath it is still clearly and proudly
recognizable as Perl.

Mason is most often used for generating web pages. It has a companion web
framework, Poet, designed to take maximum advantage of its routing and content
generation features. It can also be used as the templating layer for web
frameworks such as Catalyst and Dancer.
