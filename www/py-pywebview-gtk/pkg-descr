pywebview is a lightweight cross-platform wrapper around a webview
component that allows to display HTML content in its own native GUI
window. It gives you the power of web technologies in your desktop
application, hiding the fact that the GUI is browser based. Available
for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. You can use pywebview either
with a 3rd party web framework or on its own with a two way bridge
between Python and DOM.
