This project contains various useful extensions to the Haml template language's
Ruby implementation. Such extensions are useful enough to be distributed, but
not widely used or on-topic enough to belong in Haml proper.

This gives the Haml project a reasonable way to both demote current
functionality, such as the Textile and Maruku filters, and add new experimental
functionality that may later be added to the core.
