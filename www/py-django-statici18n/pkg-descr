When dealing with internationalization in JavaScript code, Django provides
the javascript_catalog view which sends out a JavaScript code library with
functions that mimic the gettext interface, plus an array of translation
strings.

At first glance, it works well and everything is fine. But, because
javascript_catalog view is generating JavaScript catalog dynamically
on each request, it's adding an overhead that can be an issue with site
growth.
