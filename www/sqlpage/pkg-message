To get started, configure ${PREFIX}/etc/sqlpage/sqlpage.json and at least set
your database source and create a database. If using SQLite, set ownership
appropriately. SQLPage runs as user sqlpage per default. Once the datasource is
set, you can start the sqlpage using normal rc script:

  sysrc sqlpage_enable=yes
  service sqlpage start

This will start a web server on port 8080. See
https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/blob/main/configuration.md for more
configuration details.
