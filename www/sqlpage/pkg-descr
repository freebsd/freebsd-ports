SQLPage transforms your SQL queries into stunning websites

SQLPage is a tool that allows you to build websites using nothing more than SQL
queries. You write simple text files containing SQL queries, SQLPage runs them
on your database, and renders the results as a website.

You can display the information you SELECT from your database in lists, tables,
cards and other user interface widgets. But you can also INSERT, UPDATE and
DELETE data from your database using SQLPage, and build a full webapp with
Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality.
