Template Toolkit is the best Perl template framework. The only problem
with it is that using it for simple stuff is a little bit cumbersome.
Also there is no good utility for using it from the command line.

This module is a simple wrapper around Template Toolkit. It exports a
function called tt which returns a new Template::Toolkit::Simple object.
The object supports method calls for setting all the Template Toolkit
options.

This module also installs a program called tt-render which you can use
from the command line to render templates with all the power of the Perl
object. All of the object methods become command line arguments in the
command line version.
