SEQUIN is intended to extract the keywords used and the name of
the search engine given the a line from a logfile that contains a
referal URL from a Search Engine which GETs its data.

Unlike traditional applications for doing this, it does not rely
on a preset list of search engines and thus currently works with
almost every search engine URL the author could get his hands on.
