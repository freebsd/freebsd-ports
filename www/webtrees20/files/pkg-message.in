The following configuration will need to be done prior to using
webtrees for the first time:

1. For installation on the apache web server, add the following to your
   apache site configuration, and restart the web server:

	Alias /webtrees20 %%WWWDIR%%/

	### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30
	### or later.
	AcceptPathInfo On

	<Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
		AllowOverride None
		Order Allow,Deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

2. Webtrees uses a MySQL database.  Configure a MySQL webtrees user
   and database using commands such as (substitute PASSWD for something
   of your own choosing):

	mysql> create user webtrees20@localhost identified by PASSWD;
	mysql> create database webtrees20;
	mysql> grant all on webtrees20.* to webtrees20@localhost;

3. Configure webtrees by browsing to the webtrees URL:
	http://your.server.com/webtrees20/
   and you should be taken to the setup wizard, which will lead you
   through setting up webtrees: asking for the database server, database
   user and database name, and then assist you in creating a webtrees
   admin account, etc.
