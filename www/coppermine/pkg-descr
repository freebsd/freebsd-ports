Coppermine Photo Gallery is a picture gallery script. Users can upload
pictures with a web browser (thumbnails are created on the fly), rate
pictures, add comments and send e-cards. The admins can manage the
galleries and batch add pictures that have been uploaded on the server
by FTP.

Images are stored in albums and albums can be grouped by categories. The
script supports multiple users and each user can possibly have its own
set of albums.

The script also supports multiple languages and has a theme system. It
uses PHP, a MySQL database and the GD library (version 1.x or 2.x)
or ImageMagick to make the thumbnails. An install script makes the
installation fast and simple.
