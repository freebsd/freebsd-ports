This plugin is a password store for the AccountManagerPlugin that
provides authentication and group membership from an LDAP
service. Users are authenticated by performing an LDAP bind against a
directory using their credentials. The plugin will also pull the email
address and username from the directory and populate the
session_attribute table.
