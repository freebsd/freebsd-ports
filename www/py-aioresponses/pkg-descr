Aioresponses is a helper to mock/fake web requests in python aiohttp package.

For requests module there are a lot of packages that help us with testing
(eg. httpretty, responses, requests-mock).

When it comes to testing asynchronous HTTP requests it is a bit harder
(at least at the beginning). The purpose of this package is to provide an
easy way to test asynchronous HTTP requests.
