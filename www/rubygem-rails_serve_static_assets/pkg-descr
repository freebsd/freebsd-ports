This gem forces Rails to serve static assets.

By default Rails4 will return a 404 if an asset is not handled via an external
proxy such as Nginx.  While this default behavior may help you debug your Nginx
configuration, it makes a default Rails application with assets unusable on a
12factor platform.  This gem fixes that.
