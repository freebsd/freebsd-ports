The Google API Client Library enables you to work with Google APIs such as
Google+, Drive, or YouTube on your server. These client libraries are
officially supported by Google. However, the libraries are considered complete
and are in maintenance mode.
This means that we will address critical bugs and security issues but will not
add any new features.
