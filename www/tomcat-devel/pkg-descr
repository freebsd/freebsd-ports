Apache Tomcat is a web server written in 100% Pure Java.

Apache Tomcat 9.x is the current focus of development. It builds on Tomcat
8.0.x and 8.5.x and implements the current draft of the Servlet 4.0
specification and also the JSP 2.3, EL 3.0, WebSocket 1.1 and JASPIC 1.1
specifications (the versions required by Java EE 8 platform).

Development releases may contain large amounts of untested or missing
functionality required by the specification and/or significant
bugs and are not expected to run stably for any length of time.
