mod_vhost_ldap is an Apache 2.x module for storing and configuring
virtual hosts from LDAP. It supports DocumentRoot, ScriptAlias,
ServerName, ServerAlias, ServerAdmin, and SuexecUserGroup directives.
It's built on top of mod_ldap, so it uses its caching capabilities and
can be used with a threaded Apache httpd.
