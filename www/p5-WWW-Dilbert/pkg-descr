This module will download the latest Dilbert of the Day cartoon strip
from the Dilbert website and return an object which can be either
stored in a database or output to a browser, disk or whatever. It
allows importing of Dilbert strips from disk or alternate URLs, and
has a random strip interface to return strips from the database.
