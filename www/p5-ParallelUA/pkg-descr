ParallelUserAgent allows you to connect to multiple sites _in parallel_!
You can register a number of requests, then call the 'wait' method and see
how the requests come in as each server responds.

ParallelUserAgent is basically an extension of the current UserAgent and
RobotUA modules that come with libwww5. It installs into the ::Parallel
subtree under the standard LWP directory that ships with libwww5.
