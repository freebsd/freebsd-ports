buku is a powerful bookmark manager written in Python3 and SQLite3. When I
started writing it, I couldn't find a flexible command-line solution with a
private, portable, merge-able database along with seamless GUI integration.
Hence, buku (after my son's nickname, meaning close to the heart in my
language).

buku can auto-import bookmarks from your browser(s) or fetch the title and
description of a bookmarked url from the web. You can use your favourite editor
to compose and update bookmarks. With multiple search options, including regex
and a deep scan mode (particularly for URLs), it can find any bookmark
instantly. buku can look up the latest snapshot of a broken link on the Wayback
Machine. There's an Easter egg to revisit random forgotten bookmarks too! Buku
is too busy to track you: no hidden history, obsolete records, usage analytics
or homing.
