%%PORTNAME%% has been installed into:

    %%WWWDIR%%

To make repos-web available through your web site, I suggest
that you add something like the following to httpd.conf:

Alias /%%PORTNAME%% %%WWWDIR%%
SVNIndexXSLT "/%%PORTNAME%%/view/repos.xsl"

To set up the Very Simple Logviewer in %%PORTNAME%%/open/log/index.php there is a line: 
$repo = '@@Repository@@'; // repository root, no trailing slash 
Replace @@Repository@@ with the subversion url to your repository root. 
It can be any subversion URL, both http:// and file:///. You can use 
"http:" if you have public read access to the repository.
