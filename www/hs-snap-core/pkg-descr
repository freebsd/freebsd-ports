Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written
in Haskell.  This library contains the core definitions and types for
the Snap framework, including:

  1. Primitive types and functions for HTTP (requests, responses, cookies,
     post/query parameters, etc).

  2. Type aliases and helper functions for Iteratee I/O.

  3. A monad for programming web handlers called "Snap", inspired by happstack's,
     which allows:

     - Stateful access to the HTTP request and response objects.

     - Monadic failure (i.e. MonadPlus/Alternative instances) for declining to
       handle requests and chaining handlers together.

     - Early termination of the computation if you know early what you want to
       return and want to prevent further monadic processing.
