[ excerpt (with adaptations) from developer's website ]

The aim of BINS is to generate HTML photo albums.

Some of the functionalities of BINS are:
- album can contains other albums (sub albums): the album can have
  a tree structure ;
- generation of a thumbnail and of scaled images of each picture ;
- number and size of scaled pictures can be personalized, in pixels
  or percentage of the original image ;
- several description fields (date, location, etc...) can be
  associated with the pictures ;
- use the EXIF data structure found on some JPEG (usually, those
  produced by digital cameras) to fill automatically some fields
  (date and time for example).
