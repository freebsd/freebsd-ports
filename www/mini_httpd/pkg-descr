mini_httpd is a small HTTP server.  Its performance is not great, but for
low or medium traffic sites it's quite adequate.  It implements all the
basic features of an HTTP server, including:

  - GET, HEAD, and POST methods
  - CGI and basic authentication support
  - Security against ".." filename snooping
  - The common MIME types
  - Trailing-slash redirection
  - index.html, index.htm, index.cgi
  - Directory listings
  - Multihoming (virtual hosting)
  - Standard logging
  - Custom error pages

It can also be configured to do SSL/HTTPS and IPv6.
