Peruser is an Apache 2 modules based on metuxmpm. The fundamental
concept behind them is to run each apache child process as its own
user and group, each handling its own set of virtual hosts. Peruser
and recent metuxmpm releases can also chroot() apache processes.
The result is a sane and secure web server environment for your
users, without kludges like PHP's safe_mode.
