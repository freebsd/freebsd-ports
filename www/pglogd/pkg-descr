pgLOGd, simply put, is a program that takes web server log entries and 
sends them to a database. It is called pgLOGd because of the database 
it was designed to function with, PostgreSQL. 

It is fast, robust and features fall-back-logging to a text file.  It 
is flexible and typically uses less than 128K of memory.
