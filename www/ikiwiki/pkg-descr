ikiwiki is a wiki compiler. It converts wiki pages into html pages
suitable for publishing on a website. Unlike many wikis, ikiwiki does
not have its own ad-hoc means of storing page history, and instead
uses a revision control system (currently supported is bzr, git,
mercurial, monotone, subversion and tla).

There are many other features, including support for blogging, as well
as a large array of plugins.
