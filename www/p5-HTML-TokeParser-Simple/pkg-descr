HTML::TokeParser::Simple is a subclass of HTML::TokeParser that uses
easy-to-remember method calls to work with the tokens.  Rather than
try to remember a bunch of array indices or try to write a bunch of
constants for them, you can now do something like:

 $token->is_start_tag( 'form' )

Instead of

 $token->[0] eq 'S' and $token->[1] eq 'form'
