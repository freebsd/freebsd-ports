googler is a power tool to Google (Web & News) and Google Site Search
from the command-line. It shows the title, URL and abstract for each result,
which can be directly opened in a browser from the terminal. Results are
fetched in pages (with page navigation). Supports sequential searches
in a single googler instance.
