pServ is a small, portable HTTP server. It is written in pure C for speed and
portability. It runs as a standalone program and does not require inetd.
It should be small enough to be used in a mobile computer or to be run on your
obsolete workstation you have somewhere.

This port contains a patched version to support the execution of php scripts.
