Anyterm provides a terminal emulator on a Web page using Javascript and a
server daemon. The daemon typically runs behind an HTTP proxy; it forks a shell
and communicates with the script using XMLHTTP on port 80 or securely using
SSL. This provides you with shell access to your machine from almost any Web
browser, even when firewalls are in the way.
