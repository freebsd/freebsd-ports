************************************************************************
Horde has been installed in %%HORDEDIR%% with your blank
configuration files.

If you want Horde to access a database, you have to run the
appropriate scripts located in %%HORDEDIR%%/scripts/sql.
It is recommended that you change the password of the 'hordemgr'
user used to connect to the horde database.
Horde is setup by default to access MySQL.

WARNING! if you are upgrading from Horde v. 2.2.x, you have to alter your
******** database schemas. Please read the doc UPGRADING.

You can now access Horde without a password at <http://localhost/horde/>,
and you will be logged in as an administrator. You should first configure
a real authentication backend.  Click on "Setup" in the "Administration"
menu and configure Horde. Start in the "Authentication" tab.
See the doc in %%DOCSDIR%% for details.
(tip: if you plan to install IMP, just keep "Automatic authentication as
a certain user", add your login to be treated as administrator, and once
IMP will be installed, switch to "Let a Horde application handle auth").
Select a log driver; if you keep 'file', do not forget to add a line
in /etc/newsyslog.conf.
Then select and configure a preferences driver.

Your %%APACHE_CONF%% has been updated,
you have to restart Apache.

When everything is OK, you should be able to access Horde from
<http://localhost/horde/>.
(If <http://localhost/horde/> does not run, but
 <http://localhost/horde/index.php> is OK, then you have
 to define index.php as a DirectoryIndex in %%APACHE_CONF%%.)

There is a testing script at <http://localhost/horde/test.php>.
