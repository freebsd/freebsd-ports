To enable certificate handling for SSL connnections, set
SSL_CERT_DIR and SSL_CERT_FILE in your environment to the
proper values (depending upon which SSL library
%%PREFIX%%/bin/lynx uses), as described in:

%%DOCSDIR%%/docs/README.sslcerts

and:

%%DOCSDIR%%/docs/README.rootcerts.

You may also need to generate keys and certificates as
described in the latter document and your SSL documentation.
