The following configuration will need to be done prior to using
webtrees for the first time:

1. For installation on the apache web server, add the following to your
   apache site configuration, and reload the web server:

	Alias /webtrees %%WWWDIR%%/

	### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30
	### or later.
	AcceptPathInfo On

	<Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
		AllowOverride None
		Order Allow,Deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

2. For installation on the nginx web server, add the following to your
   nginx site configuration, and reload the web server:

	location /webtrees {
		alias %%WWWDIR%%;
		index  index.php;
	}

	location ~ \.php$ {
		fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/php-fpm-www.socket;
		fastcgi_param  HTTPS on;
		fastcgi_index  index.php;
		fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME $request_filename;
		include        fastcgi_params;
	}

3. Webtrees uses a MySQL database.  Configure a MySQL webtrees user
   and database using commands such as (substitute PASSWD for something
   of your own choosing):

	mysql> create user webtrees@localhost identified by PASSWD;
	mysql> create database webtrees;
	mysql> grant all on webtrees.* to webtrees@localhost;

4. Configure webtrees by browsing to the webtrees URL:
	http://your.server.com/webtrees/
   and you should be taken to the setup wizard, which will lead you
   through setting up webtrees: asking for the database server, database
   user and database name, and then assist you in creating a webtrees
   admin account, etc.
