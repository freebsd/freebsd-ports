=========================================================================
There remains some webtrees local configuration in %%WWWDIR%%/data.

If you plan on reinstalling webtrees, leave this configuration there and
it will be reused by the new version.

If you are completely uninstalling webtrees, please delete this directory
and %%WWWDIR%% by hand.

You may want to save your GEDCOM file(s) from the MySQL server, too.  To
do that, you will need to reinstall webtrees, log on as an administrator
and select:
	My Page >> GEDCOM Administration >> Download
This will let you save your family tree data in a foo.ged GEDCOM file
which you can upload into most other ancestry software or websites.
