SOGo 5 was installed

1) if you are updated sogo from version < 5.6, you must do the following:

drop sogo_sessions_folder table. A new version of this table will be generated
automatically

if you are using nginx, you must change proxy_buffer_size from 4k to 8k. It
avoids "unhandled error response" on webmail login

2) In order to run the sogo daemon (sogod), you will need to create and configure
the main configuration file, e.g.:

# cp -p %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/sogo/sogo.conf.sample %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/sogo/sogo.conf

And to allow the service to run at system startup, add sogod_enable="YES"
in your rc.conf.

3) If you need to allow email alarms (notifications) for calendar events, copy
the sample credentials file:

# cp -p %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/sogo/ealarms-notify.creds.sample \
 %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/sogo/ealarms-notify.creds

Then replace the username:password with appropriate credentials for SMTP AUTH
sending capabilities.

Then copy the sample cron executable:

# cp -p %%LOCALBASE%%/GNUstep/Local/Tools/Admin/cron-ealarms-notify.sample \
 %%LOCALBASE%%/GNUstep/Local/Tools/Admin/cron-ealarms-notify

And edit this file to suit your server timezone (e.g. TZ=Africa/Algiers).

Then add the following lines to the root users' crontab (crontab -e):

# Process email reminders every minute
* * * * * %%LOCALBASE%%/GNUstep/Local/Tools/Admin/cron-ealarms-notify

4) If you need to automatically purge vacation messages from users sieve scripts,
copy the sample credentials file:

# cp -p ${LOCALBASE}/etc/sogo/expire-autoreply.creds.sample \
 %%LOCALBASE%%/etc/sogo/expire-autoreply.creds

Then replace the username:password with appropriate credentials for your
IMAP servers' sieve account.

Then copy the sample cron executable:

# cp -p %%LOCALBASE%%/GNUstep/Local/Tools/Admin/cron-expire-autoreply.sample \
 %%LOCALBASE%%/GNUstep/Local/Tools/Admin/cron-expire-autoreply

And edit this file to suit your server timezone (e.g. TZ=Africa/Algiers).

Then add the following lines to the root users' crontab (crontab -e):

# Vacation messages expiration
# The credentials file should contain the sieve admin credentials (username:passwd)
0 0 * * * %%LOCALBASE%%/GNUstep/Local/Tools/Admin/cron-expire-autoreply

Additional useful script files are located at %%DATADIR%%
