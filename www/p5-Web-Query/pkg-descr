Web::Query is a yet another scraping framework, have a jQuery like
interaface.

Yes, I know ingy's pQuery. But it's just a alpha quality. It doesn't
works.  Web::Query built at top of the CPAN modules,
HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath, LWP::UserAgent, and HTML::Selector::XPath.

So, this module uses HTML::Selector::XPath, then this module only
supports CSS3 selector supported by HTML::Selector::XPath. Web::Query
doesn't support jQuery's extended quries(yet?).
