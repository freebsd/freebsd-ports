WARNING: If you are upgrading from ajaxplorer (the
old project name) version 5.0.4 please note that the project
changed it's name and files have been moved to a new location.

The old configuration files need to be moved from the old
location to the new intallation. and some files need
to be deleted.
Please run the following commands (adjust paths if necessary):
 # rm %%GOWDIR%%/ajaxplorer/data/cache/i18n/*.ser
 # rm %%GOWDIR%%/ajaxplorer/data/cache/*.ser
 # cp -R %%GOWDIR%%/ajaxplorer/* %%WWWDIR%%/

Also, if you're using database backends, update scripts
for mysql and sqlite are available in these locations:

%%WWWDIR%%/conf/5.2.0.sql
%%WWWDIR%%/conf/5.2.0.sqlite

Finally you'll need to update your webserver configuration to point
to the new installation directory %%WWWDIR%%.

Please also read the upgrading notes at:

************************************************************************

If you are upgrading from Pydio 5 to Pydio 7, a direct upgrade is not
supported without upgrading from Pydio 5 to Pydio 6, then to Pydio 7.
Either backup your data and reinstall Pydio 7 from scratch or manually
upgrade by using this guide:

https://pydio.com/forum/f/topic/troubleshooting-upgrade-to-v6/

Then doing the upgrade from Pydio 6 to Pydio 7. You may have to
manually upgrade the database, depending on your backend:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/pydio-core/develop/dist/php/7.0.1.mysql
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/pydio-core/develop/dist/php/7.0.1.pgsql
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/pydio-core/develop/dist/php/7.0.1.sqlite

Choosing the file matching your backend, then parsing it. Once this process
is completed, Pydio may be updated using the web interface.

************************************************************************

************************************************************************

If you are upgrading from Pydio 7 to Pydio 8, please read follow the
following quickstart guide for FreeBSD users.
If the installer / upgrader fails upon trying to access it and there is
an error message in your PHP log about "open_basedir" restriction from

%%WWWDIR%%/pydio/plugins/gui.ajax/RichClient.php

editing the file and changing line 512 from:

if(file_exists(AJXP_INSTALL_PATH . "." . $imagesFolder)){

to

if(file_exists(AJXP_INSTALL_PATH . "/" . $imagesFolder)){

should help with this issue.

When using MySQL as database backend and the user you use for accessing
the database might temporary need all privileges (GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES)
on the Pydio database during the upgrade process.
The privileges may be set back afterwards.

If you use a cache driver (Doctrine), the upgrade process may fail. To
disable the cache driver temporarily, edit:

%%WWWDIR%%/pydio/plugins/boot.conf/bootstrap.json

and remove the "core.cache" part. It can be added once the upgrade
finished or re-configured in the admin panel.

Additionally cleaning the following temporary directory might be
helpful:

%%WWWDIR%%/pydio/cache
