 # cp -R %%GOWDIR%%/ajaxplorer/* %%WWWDIR%%/

Also, if you're using database backends, update scripts

************************************************************************

If you are upgrading from Pydio 5 to Pydio 7, a direct upgrade is not
supported without upgrading from Pydio 5 to Pydio 6, then to Pydio 7.
Either backup your data and reinstall Pydio 7 from scratch or manually
upgrade by using this guide:

https://pydio.com/forum/f/topic/troubleshooting-upgrade-to-v6/

Then doing the upgrade from Pydio 6 to Pydio 7. You may have to
manually upgrade the database, depending on your backend:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/pydio-core/develop/dist/php/7.0.1.mysql
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/pydio-core/develop/dist/php/7.0.1.pgsql
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/pydio-core/develop/dist/php/7.0.1.sqlite

Choosing the file matching your backend, then parsing it. Once this process
is completed, Pydio may be updated using the web interface.

************************************************************************

************************************************************************

If you are upgrading from Pydio 7 to Pydio 8, please read follow the
following quickstart guide for FreeBSD users.

When using MySQL as database backend and the user you use for accessing
the database might temporary need all privileges (GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES)
on the Pydio database during the upgrade process.
The privileges may be set back afterwards.

If you use a cache driver (Doctrine), the upgrade process may fail. To
disable the cache driver temporarily, edit:

%%WWWDIR%%/pydio/plugins/boot.conf/bootstrap.json

and remove the "core.cache" part. It can be added once the upgrade
finished or re-configured in the admin panel.

Additionally cleaning the following temporary directory might be
helpful:

%%WWWDIR%%/pydio/cache
