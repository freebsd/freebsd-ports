       This module provides you with an object-oriented (and
       subclassable) way of outputting HTML.  Basically, you open
       up an "HTML stream" on an existing filehandle, and then do
       all of your output to the HTML stream (you can intermix
       HTML-stream-output and ordinary-print-output, if you
       like).
