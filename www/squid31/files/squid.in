# PROVIDE: squid
# REQUIRE: LOGIN
# KEYWORD: shutdown
#
# Note:
# Set "squid_enable=yes" in either /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.conf.local or
# /etc/rc.conf.d/squid to activate Squid.
#
# Additional variables you can define in one of these files:
#
# squid_chdir:	the directory into which the rc system moves into before
# 		starting Squid. Default: /var/squid
#
# squid_conf:	The configuration file that Squid should use.
#		Default: %%PREFIX%%/etc/squid/squid.conf
#
# squid_fib:	The alternative routing table id that Squid should use.
#		Default: none
#		See setfib(1) for further details. Note that the setfib(2)
#		system call is not available in FreeBSD versions prior to 7.1.
#
# squid_user:	The user id that should be used to run the Squid master
#		process. Default: %%SQUID_UID%%.
#		Note that you probably need to define "squid_user=root" if
#		you want to run Squid in reverse proxy setups or if you want
#		Squid to listen on a "privileged" port < 1024.
#
# squid_pidfile:
#		The name (including the full path) of the Squid
#		master process' PID file.
#		Default: /var/run/squid/squid.pid.
#		You only need to change this if you changed the
#		corresponding entry in your Squid configuration.
#
# squid_flags:	Additional commandline arguments for Squid you might want to
#		use. See squid(8) for further details.
