DeCSS is a utility for stripping Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) tags from an
HTML page. That's all it does. It has no relationship whatsoever to
encryption, copy protection, movies, software freedom, oppressive industry
cartels, Web site witch hunts, or any other bad things that could get you
in trouble.
