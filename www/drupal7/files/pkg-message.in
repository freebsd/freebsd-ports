Complete instructions for installing and configuring Drupal can be found here:

%%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.txt

You need to create the DB where Drupal is going to live, and depending on
which database you intend to use, you should consult one of the following
documents:

 %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.mysql.txt
 %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.pgsql.txt
 %%DOCSDIR%%/INSTALL.sqlite.txt

You also need to add appropriate configuration directives to your apache
configuration file (%%PREFIX%%/etc/apache(2)/httpd.conf).

A typical configuration might read:

    Alias /drupal "%%DRUPAL_DIR%%"
    <Directory "%%DRUPAL_DIR%%">
        Options Indexes FollowSymlinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

Please see http://drupal.org/cron for important information on setting up
periodic maintenance tasks in Drupal.

Please see http://drupal.org/requirements for important information on
system requirements for Drupal 7.  In particular, please ensure that your
configuration:

- uses PHP 5.2.5 or later
- PHP "memory_limit" is set to "32Mb" or larger
- PHP "register_globals" is set to "Off"
- PHP "safe_mode" is set to "Off"
- PHP "session.cache_limiter" is set to "nocache"
