This plugin extends the Trac Wiki in several ways:

- Support for displaying smileys;
- HTML 4.0 entities (named entities and numerical entities);
- Automatic replacement of common text idioms by their corresponding symbols
  (e.g. arrows, fractions, etc.);
- Simplified markup for single words: *this* /is/ _important_;
- Replace <name@domain> with "mailto:" links (obfuscated if needed)
  (0.11 only - though that's now in Trac core);
- Replace \\... UNC paths with "file:///" links (0.11 only);

Each feature can be disabled individually if needed.
