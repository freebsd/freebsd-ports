Gungho is Yet Another Web Crawler Framework, aimed to be extensible
and fast.

Gungho tries to build from clean structures, based upon principles
from the likes of Catalyst and Plagger, so that you can easily
extend it to your liking.

Features such as robot rules handling (robots.txt) and request
throttling can be removed/added on the fly, just by specifying
the components that you want to load. You can easily create
additional functionality by writing your own component.
