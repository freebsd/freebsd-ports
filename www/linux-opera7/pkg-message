Subject: Preview 3 of Opera 7.10 for Linux available
Date: 2003-04-03 03:12:15 PST

This is the first release ever that is synchronized with an Opera for windows
release. Windows is released as 7.10 Beta 1 today and since we share the user
interface and most of the other components we have jumped to the 7.10 tag as
well (thus skipping 7.0). We have not has as much time to test this release
compared with the windows version and we lack some linux specific features so
we still name it a Technology Preview.

Please discuss this release in the opera.linux newsgroup or opera-linux mail
list before submitting bugs to our BTS (Bug Tracking System). We recommend that
you not install it over a current version of Opera.

Before you run Opera7:
   Since this is a beta it might be a good idea to backup your personal
   "~/.opera" directory and remove it. This can be done from the command line
   using "cp -Rp ~/.opera ~/.opera-mybackup" and "rm -rf ~/.opera".
