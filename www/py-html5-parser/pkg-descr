A fast implementation of the HTML 5 parsing spec for Python. Parsing
is done in C using a variant of the gumbo parser. The gumbo parse
tree is then transformed into an lxml tree, also in C, yielding
parse times that can be a thirtieth of the html5lib parse times.
That is a speedup of 30x. This differs, for instance, from the gumbo
python bindings, where the initial parsing is done in C but the
transformation into the final tree is done in python.
