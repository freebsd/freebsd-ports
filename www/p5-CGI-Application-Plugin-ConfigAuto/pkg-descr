CGI::Application::Plugin::ConfigAuto adds easy access to config file
variables to your CGI::Application modules. Lazy loading is used to
prevent the config file from being parsed if no configuration variables
are accessed during the request.

The format is detected automatically using Config::Auto. It is known to
support the following formats: colon separated, space separated, equals
separated, XML, Perl code, and Windows INI. See that modules
documentation for complete details.
