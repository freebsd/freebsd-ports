To run the Payara Java Application Server from startup, add
payara_enable="YES" in your /etc/rc.conf.
Extra options can be found in the startup script.

By default Payara server is started by 'payara' user account.  On service
start/stop caches and preferences are written to the payara user home
directory. To make it possible and avoid related warnings set 'payara' user
home directory to some writable place in the file system. To use the
default location, issue the command: 
/usr/sbin/pw usermod payara -d %%VARDIR%%/prefs

Because default payara user is low-privileged, to allow Payara to listen
ports under 1024 you will need to tweak Mandatory Access Control policies.
