gaeutilities is a collection of classes to aid in development
on Google Appengine.

The stable version includes the following classes:

Session: An http session class to preserve identity across http requests.
         It uses both BigTable and Memcache for performance and reliability.
         It also includes middleware to plug in with django.
Cache: A BigTable and Memcache caching class. Any object that can be pickled
       can be stored in cache.
Event: A subscribe/fire event system that gives developers the ability to set
       callback functions.
Flash: A cookie based messaging library. Using json, data structures can be
       stored as a cookie in the browser and retrieved on the next request.
       Useful for messages such as "Thank you for logging in."
