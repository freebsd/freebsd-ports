Changelog for 8.02 Final: http://www.opera.com/linux/changelogs/802/

If you are upgrade from version 7.x or below, it is recommend for you to
backup your personal "~/.linux-opera" directory and remove it. It can be done
following from the command line:

	# cp -Rp ~/.linux-opera ~/.linux-opera-bak
	# rm -rf ~/.linux-opera/*

After that, you can put your bookmark, email, contacts and etc back in
~/.linux-opera/. The bookmark is ~/.linux-opera/opera6.adr and the email is
~/.linux-opera/mail as you can figure out by view in ~/.linux-opera/. It is
probably not good idea to put opera6.ini, userstyle.ini, search.ini,
pluginpath.ini and other non-personal stuff back in ~/.linux-opera/. The
non-personal stuff should be re-configure on new stuff by either Opera
preferences in GUI or hand (manual) in your editor.
