This is the unstable version of the Mozilla suite (Web browser,
HTML editor, mail user agent, news reader, and IRC client) pre-compiled
for Linux.  Instead of using this port, another way to run plugins
which are only available as Linux binaries is to install the
linuxpluginwrapper port.

If you find a Java plugin which works with this port, please tell
the maintainer.
