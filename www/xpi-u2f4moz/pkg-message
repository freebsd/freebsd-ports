Nota bene

1) you need Read and Write permissions on Yubico device
2) if you get the message "U2F Support Add-on could not be verified
   for use in Firefox and has been disabled", then type about:config
   in the address bar and set xpinstall.signatures.required to false
   (restart Firefox or reload the page about:addons)
