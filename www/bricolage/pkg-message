************************************************************
NEW INSTALL:

The Bricolage software has now been installed, but there are
number of steps remaining to make it usable.

You must: 1) Import the database
          2) Edit your apache.conf file
          3) Change the Bricolage admin user password

1) If the database for Bricolage does not already exist, you
   must create it now using %%PREFIX%%/bin/bric_pgimport.

Common Supported Options:
  -u Database user login.
  -p Database user password.
  -d Database name.
  -c Create the database first.
  -m Make a new user. Pass in the user name
     and password separated by a colon.

Example:

	%%PREFIX%%/bin/bric_pgimport -u pgsql -d bric -c -m bric:password

For additional options, see:

	%%PREFIX%%/bin/bric_pgimport --help

Edit %%PREFIX%%/bricolage/conf/bricolage.conf
to reflect the database, username and password chosen
for the bricolage database.


2) Add the below lines to %%PREFIX%%/etc/apache/httpd.conf.

	PerlPassEnv BRICOLAGE_ROOT
	PerlModule Bric::App::ApacheConfig

NOTE: Bricolage will take over the entire namespace of the
      host it is associated to within Apache. If you are 
      serving content other than Bricolage from this 
      webserver, add those lines to a Bricolage specific 
      Virtual Host.

3) The default login and password for the Bricolage web
   interface is (without quotes):

	Login:	 	"admin"
	Password:	"change me now!"

************************************************************
UPGRADE: 

If you are upgrading from one version of the www/bricolage port to
another, skip the above installation related items and instead
run the following upgrade command after making backups of
the %%PREFIX%%/bricolage path and the bric database:

  bric_upgrade [options] <Previous Bricolage Version>

Common Supported Options:
  -u Database user login.
  -p Database user password.
  -d Database name.

Example:

	%%PREFIX%%/bin/bric_upgrade -u pgsql -d bric 1.8.0
