pear-Services_Blogging provides a unified API to post and read blog entries,
independent of the API supported by the server software hosting the blog.
It uses a driver-based approach to communicate with different APIs out there.
If a new blogging API is invented, someone just needs to write a driver for
the Services_Blogging package, and everyone can access also this blogs.
