mod_chroot makes running Apache in a secure chroot environment easy.
You don't need to create a special directory hierarchy containing
/dev, /lib, /etc...
mod_chroot allows you to run Apache in a chroot jail with no additional files.
The chroot() system call is performed at the end of startup procedure - when
all libraries are loaded and log files open.
