OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously
share a file of any size over the Tor network. It works by starting a web
server that is accessible as a Tor onion (hidden) service, and generating
an unguessable URL to access and download the files.

It doesn't require setting up a server on the Internet somewhere,
on a Virtual Private Server (VPS), or using a third party file-sharing
service. It simply shares files you want over the Tor network.
