Please, note the following statements about %%PORTNAME%% port:

    o ufdbUpdate script is left in non-working state for now.
      The only purpose of this script is to download URLfilterDB updates
      using paid subscription and to run it by cron. The script implies on
      sysconfig configuration file which is usuall only for linux systems.
      To make ufdbUpdate work it should be significantly rewritten for
      non-linux systems. It's not worth it due to the fact ufdbUpdate can
      be replaced by much more simple script written by local administator.
