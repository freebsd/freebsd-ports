This port will build a customized version of the caddy webserver
using plugins of your choice. You will need to rebuild this port
manually if one of your plugins gets updated.

Caddy is a high-performance webserver with a simple config format,
out-of-the-box HTTP/3 support, and automatic transparent ACME
certificate provisioning.

NOTE: THIS PORT BYPASSES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF FREEBSD'S CHECKSUM-
BASED DISTFILE TAMPERING DETECTION MECHANISMS. USE THIS AT YOUR
OWN PERIL (though the peril is exactly the same as using the
xcaddy port).

To make this work:

1) In /usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf, add the following:

     ALLOW_NETWORKING_PACKAGES="caddy-custom"

   You can skip this step if you're not building in poudriere.

2) Put your plugin list into make.conf (or
   /usr/local/etc/poudriere.conf/make.conf):

     .if ${.CURDIR:M*/www/caddy-custom*}
       CADDY_CUSTOM_PLUGINS= github.com/caddy-dns/rfc2136 github.com/greenpau/caddy-security
     .endif

   If you have any other xcaddy build flags you want to set, put
   them in XCADDY_ENV.

3) Profit
