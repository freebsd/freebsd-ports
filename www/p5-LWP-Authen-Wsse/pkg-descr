LWP::Authen::Wsse allows LWP to authenticate against servers that are using 
the X-WSSE authentication scheme, as required by the Atom Authentication API.

The module is used indirectly through LWP, rather than including it directly 
in your code. The LWP system will invoke the WSSE authentication when it 
encounters the authentication scheme while attempting to retrieve a URL 
from a server.
