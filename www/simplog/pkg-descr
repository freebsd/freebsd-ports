Simplog was created to provide people with an easy way to create and maintain
their own personal or a community weblog.  With the increasing number of people
creating on-line journals, there is a need for a tool that allows them a quick
and easy way to share their lives with the rest of the world.

Simplog is NOT trying to a news/portal app like Slash/Scoop/PHP-Nuke, nor
will it ever be, although it can be used for this purpose.  Simplog is
intended for use as a personal or community weblog tool.
