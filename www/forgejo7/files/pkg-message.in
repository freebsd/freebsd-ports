  message: <<EOM
Before starting forgejo for the first time, you must set a number of
secrets in the configuration file. For your convenience, a sample file
has been copied to %%PREFIX%%/etc/forgejo/conf/app.ini.

You need to replace every occurence of CHANGE_ME in the file with
sensible values. Please refer to the official documentation at
https://forgejo.org for details.

You will also likely need to create directories for persistent storage.
Run
    su -m git -c 'forgejo doctor check'
to check if all prerequisites have been met.

  message: <<EOM
Since forgejo version 7, the startup script will run forgejo doctor check
to verify that forgejo can be started successfully. If you are sure that
forgejo will start even if doctor has identified an issue, you can disable
the check by setting forgejo_configcheck_enabled=NO in rc.conf.
