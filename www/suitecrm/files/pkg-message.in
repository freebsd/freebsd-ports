Notes:

1.  SuiteCRM requires that you increase the default PHP memory limit to 128M.
    and set output_buffering = on in the php.ini file.

2.  In order to get Apache or your preferred web server to recognise Suite
    Community Edition's location on your disk, you'll need to put the
    following line (or the equivalent) into the web server configuration:

    Alias /suitecrm %%WWWDIR%%
    <Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
	AllowOverride None
	Require all granted
    </Directory>

3.  For full information on how to get the best out of Sugar Community
    Edition, please see the documentation on the web:
