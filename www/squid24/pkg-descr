This is the Squid Internet Object Cache developed by the National
Laboratory for Applied Networking Research (NLANR) and Internet
volunteers.  This software is freely available for anyone to use.

This software is based on the Harvest Object Cache developed by
the University of Colorado and the University of Southern California.
The Harvest home page is http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/.

ARPA funding for the Harvest project has ended, the squid project has
continued development of the cache where Harvest finished.

FreeBSD PORTER'S NOTES. To this moment, Squid is not well documented.
But you aren't lost in space: there is a mailing list,
<squid-users@nlanr.net>, where you will find some support and help.
We also _strongly_ suggest you to examine Web pages noted above.
