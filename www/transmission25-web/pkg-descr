Transmission Web Interface (Clutch) is a WebUI for the Transmission BitTorrent
client. It allows you to manage your torrents from anywhere you can access the
internet, and runs on OS X and various flavors of *nix. It provides most of
the basic features of the desktop client, including torrent upload, torrent
start/stop, file path selection, speed limiting etc.

Transmission has been built from the ground up to be a lightweight, yet
powerful BitTorrent client. Its simple, intuitive interface is designed
to integrate tightly with whatever computing environment you choose to
use. Transmission strikes a balance between providing useful functionality
without feature bloat. Furthermore, it is free for anyone to use or modify.

You will need to install either transmission-daemon, transmission-gtk2 or
both to use WebUI.
