       The objective of the package is to provide a fast and
       essential HTML check (esp. for CGI scripts where response
       time is important) to prevent a piece of user input HTML
       code from messing up the rest of a file, i.e., to minimize
       and localize any possible damage created by including a
       piece of user input HTML text in a dynamic document.

       HTMLQuickCheck checks for unmatched < and >, unmatched
       tags and improper nesting, which could ruin the rest of
       the document.  Attributes and elements with optional end
       tags are not checked, as they should not cause disasters
       with any decent browsers (they should ignore any
       unrecognized tags and attributes according to the
       standard).  A piece of HTML that passes HTMLQuickCheck may
       not necessarily be valid HTML, but it would be very
       unlikely to screw others but itself. A valid piece of HTML
       that doesn't pass the HTMLQuickCheck is however very
       likely to screw many browsers(which are obviously broken
       in terms of strict conformance).

       HTMLQuickCheck currently supports HTML 1.0, 2.x (draft),
       3.0 (draft) and netscape extensions (1.1).
