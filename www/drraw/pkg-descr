drraw is a simple web based presentation front-end for RRDtool that
allows you to interactively build graphs of your own design. A graph
definition can be turned into a template which may be applied to many
Round Robin Database files. drraw specializes in providing an easy
means of displaying data stored with RRDtool and does not care about
how the data is collected, making it a great complement to other
RRDtool front-ends.
