django-rest-framework-filters (formerly django-rest-framework-chain)
is an extension to Django REST Framework that makes working with
filtering much easier. In addition to fixing some underlying warts
and limitations of django-filter, we allow arbitrary chaining of
both relations and lookup filters.
