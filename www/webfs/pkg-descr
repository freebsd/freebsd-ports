This is a simple http server for purely static content.  You can
use it to serve the content of a ftp server via http for example.
It is also nice to export some files quickly by starting an http
server in a few seconds without editing a config file first.

Features/Design:
================
 * single process: select() + non-blocking I/O
 * automatically generates directory listings when asked for a
   directory (check for index.html available as option), caches
   the listings.
 * no config file, just a few switches.  Try "webfsd -h" for a
   list.
 * Uses ${PREFIX}/etc/webfsd/mime.types to map file extentions
   to mime/types (not included).
 * supports keep-alive and pipelined requests.
 * serves byte ranges.
 * optional logging in common log file format.
