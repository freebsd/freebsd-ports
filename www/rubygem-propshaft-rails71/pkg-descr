Propshaft is an asset pipeline library for Rails. It's built for an era where
bundling assets to save on HTTP connections is no longer urgent, where
JavaScript and CSS are either compiled by dedicated Node.js bundlers or served
directly to the browsers, and where increases in bandwidth have made the need
for minification less pressing. These factors allow for a dramatically simpler
and faster asset pipeline compared to previous options, like Sprockets.
