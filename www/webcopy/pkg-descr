WebCopy is a perl program that retrieves the URL specified in a unix-like
command line. It can also retrieve recursively any file that a HTML file
references, i.e. inlined images and/or anchors, if specified with an option.

It can be used as a "mirror" program to retrieve a tree of documents from a
remote site, and put them on-line immediately through the local server.
