SiteBar is a multi-user, multi-group bookmark server that lets users view,
add, import, and maintain bookmarks from anywhere. It offers enterprise-
quality access rights and granular permissions. Corporations can use it as
a complete intranet bookmark solution, and end-users can use it to access
their bookmark collection from anywhere, and share it with friends. It is
intended for use in a browser's sidebar, and offers a clean, easy to use
interface.
