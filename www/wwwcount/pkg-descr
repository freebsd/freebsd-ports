The counter, clock and date all in one program.  This is a CGI
program to record the number of raw hits on a web page.  It generates
a GIF image of the number of hits and returns to the browser as an
in-lined image. The program also has a run-time option not to show
the digit images, this way the hits can be kept without being displayed.
The hits can be monitored without incrementing from a separate page
as well. The program can also display the time and date of any timezone.
It has a option to countdown to a specific date (past or future). Almost
all of the features are run-time options.  The single program can be used
for any number of web pages, for any number of users.
