ownCloud is a self-hosted file sync and share server. It provides access to your
data through a web interface, sync clients or WebDAV while providing a platform
to view, sync and share across devices easily — all under your control.
ownCloud’s open architecture is extensible via a simple but powerful API for
applications and plugins and it works with any storage.
