retawq is an interactive, multi-threaded network client ("web browser") for
text terminals on computers with Unix-like operating systems (Linux, BSD,
Solaris, ...). It is fast, small, nicely configurable, and comfortable;
e.g. the low-level communications are performed in a non-blocking way, and
you can keep open as many "virtual windows" as you want and work
simultaneously in two of them in a split-screen mode.
