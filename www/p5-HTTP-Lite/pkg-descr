HTTP::Lite is a stand-alone lightweight HTTP/1.1 implementation for perl.  It
is not intended as a replacement for the fully-features LWP module.  Instead,
it is intended for use in situations where it is desirable to install the
minimal number of modules to achieve HTTP support, or where LWP is not a good
candidate due to CPU overhead, such as slower processors.  HTTP::Lite is also
significantly faster than LWP.

HTTP::Lite is ideal for CGI (or mod_perl) programs or for bundling for
redistribution with larger packages where only HTTP GET and POST functionality
are necessary.

If you require more functionality, such as FTP or HTTPS, please see libwwwperl
(LWP).  LWP is a significantly better and more comprehensive package than
HTTP::Lite, and should be used instead of HTTP::Lite whenever possible.
