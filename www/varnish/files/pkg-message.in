QUICK-START GUIDE

It's two in the morning and someone posted a link to your website on
slashdot.  Don't panic, it takes only a minute to set up Varnish in
front of your web server:

1) Install Varnish
2) Reconfigure your web server to listen on localhost:8080
3) echo 'varnishd_enable="YES"' >>/etc/rc.conf
4) %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/varnishd start

Refer to the documentation for more advanced configuration.

NOTE TO USERS UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER VERSION OF VARNISH:

Several rc variables have been renamed and / or have new default
values.  Refer to the comments in the rc.d scripts for a detailed
description of these variables.
