Squirm is a fast & configurable redirector for the Squid.

Squirm has the following features:

     -Very, very fast
     -Virtually no memory usage
     -It can re-read it's config files while running by sending it a HUP signal
     -Interactive test mode for checking new configs
     -Full regular expression matching and replacement
     -Config files for patterns and IP addresses.
     -If you mess up the config file, Squirm runs in Dodo Mode so your squid
      keeps working :-)

It has been written because the existing redirector scripts used too much
memory and all were too slow for Squids that receive a lot of requests.

It can handle nifty things like file mirrors with the regex pattern replacement
strings, and do site blocking - useful for schools. It could also do such
things as banner add rewriting, and just about anything else :-)
