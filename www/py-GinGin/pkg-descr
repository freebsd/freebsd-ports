GinGin is a hybrid of WIKI and BLOG. Users of GinGin can setup tags for
their documents. The documents will be hyper-linked, automatically, when
tags are in the content of them. In another word, GinGin will create
cross-reference for documents by the tags specified by users.

GinGin also has capability to tag URLs. URLs are associated with tags and
cross-referenced for documents.
