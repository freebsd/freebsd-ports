 1) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and restart the server:

  Alias /joomla %%WWWDIR%%/
  AcceptPathInfo On

  <Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
  </Directory>

 2) Visit your Joomla site with a browser (i.e. http://your.server.com/joomla/),
    and you should be taken to the install.php script, which will lead you
    through creating a config.php file and then setting up Joomla, creating
    an admin account, etc.
