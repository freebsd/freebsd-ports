This is a little WWW-proxy that can communicate over both IPv4 and IPv6. It's
primary use is as stub-proxy between a IPv4-only browser and the rest of the
(v4 and v6) Internet. This proxy is meant to run on a client machine as
frontend to an IPv4-only browser and not to serve a large number of clients.
If you need the latter you're much better off with a full-fledged proxy like
squid.
