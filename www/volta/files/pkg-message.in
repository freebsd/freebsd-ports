To get volta up and running, you'll still need to do two things:

 - Enable url rewriting from within the squid configuration file.

 url_rewrite_children 10
 url_rewrite_program %%PREFIX%%/bin/volta -f %%PREFIX%%/etc/volta.db

 - Create a volta rule database! For detailed instructions, please
 reference %%DATADIR%%/README, or volta's website at:
