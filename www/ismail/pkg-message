Before Inside Systems Mail will work!!
======================================

An ismail.conf file must be created and placed in

%%INSTALLDIR%%/include

A reference ismail.conf has been provided at

%%INSTALLDIR%%/include/ismail.conf.sample

but requires modification to work. Please check the
provided HTML documentation in %%DOCSDIR%% or browse
http://www.insidesystems.net/projects/project.php?projectid=4
for configuration help.

Note: The default configuration data store requires domxml
to be compiled in to to mod_php4. For alternate datastores,
check %%EXAMPLESDIR%% for sample postgresql and mysql
schemas and set the ismail.conf file accordingly.
