POST-INSTALL CONFIGURATION FOR Freeway
=====================================

1) Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   ### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30 or later.
   Alias /freeway %%WWWDIR%%/
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

2) Visit your Freeway site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/freeway/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config.php file and then
   setting up Freeway.
