mod_auth_mysql41_ap2 is an Apache module that allows authentication using user and group data stored in MySQL databases. Originally by Vivek Khera for Apache1, now also includes a version for Apache 2.  This version has been modified from the version by Sam Brauer <sbrauer@users.sourceforge.net> at http://sourceforge.net/projects/modauthmysql to support MySQL 4.1 with Apache 2.  Group Authentication has not been implemented yet.
