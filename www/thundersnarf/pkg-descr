ThunderSnarf is a web reporting and trending tool for Thunder Cache Pro which
has the main goal to provide a strategic overview of how Thunder is caching and
what it is caching, aggregating value and helping on decision making regarding
the real web acceleration rates and allowing one to identify unefficient cache
patterns, plugins, as well as domains which should have a plugin written for
and, off course, the top efficient domains and caching patterns as well.
