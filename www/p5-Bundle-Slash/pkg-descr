       Slash -- Slashdot Like Automated Storytelling Homepage --
       is the code that runs Slashdot. More than that, however,
       Slash is an architecture for putting together web sites.
       It comes with functionality for posting articles, conducting
       polls, having discussions, and more; but it can be extended
       in innumerable ways.
       
       Bundle::Slash is a collection of prerequisite perl modules
       needed before installing Slash.
