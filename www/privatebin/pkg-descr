PrivateBin is a minimalist, open source online pastebin where the server
has zero knowledge of pasted data.

Data is encrypted/decrypted in the browser using 256bit AES in Galois
Counter mode.

This is a fork of ZeroBin, originally developed by Sebastien Sauvage.
It was refactored to allow easier and cleaner extensions and has now much
more features than the original. It is however still fully compatible to
the original ZeroBin 0.19 data storage scheme. Therefore such installations
can be upgraded to this fork without losing any data.

Since the Javascript code that performs the encryption must be protected
during transmission, access to PrivateBin must only be possible over
HTTPS (e.g. enforced by use of HSTS and/or HPKP).

See https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Configuration for
configuration options available in "cfg/conf.php".
