websocketd is a small command-line tool that will wrap an existing command-line
interface program, and allow it to be accessed via a WebSocket.

WebSocket-capable applications can now be built very easily. As long as you can
write an executable program that reads STDIN and writes to STDOUT, you can build
a WebSocket server. Do it in Python, Ruby, Perl, Bash, .NET, C, Go, PHP, Java,
Clojure, Scala, Groovy, Expect, Awk, VBScript, Haskell, Lua, R, whatever! No
networking libraries necessary.
