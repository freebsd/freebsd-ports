Mojo::DOM58 is a minimalistic and relaxed pure-Perl HTML/XML DOM parser
based on Mojo::DOM.  It supports the HTML Living Standard, Extensible
Markup Language (XML) 1.0, and matching based on CSS3 selectors.  It will
even try to interpret broken HTML and XML, so you should not use it for
validation.
