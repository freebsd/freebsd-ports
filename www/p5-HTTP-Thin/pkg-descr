HTTP::Thin is a thin wrapper around HTTP::Tiny adding the ability to pass in
HTTP::Request objects and get back HTTP::Response objects. The maintainers of
HTTP::Tiny, justifiably, don't want to have to maintain compatibility but many
other projects already consume the HTTP::Message objects. This is just glue code
doing what it does best.
