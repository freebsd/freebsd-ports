This is a fairly low level interface to the Gnome project's libghttp,
which allows you to process HTTP requests to HTTP servers.  There also
exists a slightly higher level interface - a simple get() function which
takes a URI as a parameter.

It allows you to make very simple HTTP requests, without the weight of
something like LWP.  This makes it very useful in situations where
memory and speed are at a premium, such as mod_perl.

It has full support for proxy requests and authenticated requests.
