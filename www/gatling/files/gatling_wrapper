# gatling_wrapper {gatling|tlsgatling} [options]
#
# A simple wrapper script for gatling (or any other program that does not
# daemonize itself and logs to stdout).
#
# This wrapper tries to emulate part of the functionality usually supplied
# by software like daemontools or runit.
# It can be used by a FreeBSD port rc.d script to start a program
# that does not daemonize itself and logs to stdout/stderr. It redirects stdout
# and stderr to logger(1) via a fifo.
#
# Note: We need a shell that can offer us asynchronous trap handling in order
# to be able to abort the infinite loop from outside.  FreeBSD's /bin/sh offers
# the "-T" switch for this purpose.
#
# TODO: send fd 2 output to never-never land to get rid of "Terminated" when we
# kill this script but provide a way for errx() to communicate with the outside
# world via stderr.
