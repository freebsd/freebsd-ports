The Servlet API for Perl (libservlet) is a formulation of the Java (TM)
Servlet API in Perl.

While the servlet concept originated with Java (TM), its component model is
quite natural for Perl as well. By writing servlet applications and deploying
them in a servlet container, application authors can spare themselves the
effort of writing commonly needed web application infrastructure components
for each new project. Furthermore, servlet applications are portable between
deployment environments; they can be executed in any servlet container using
any process model with only a few configuration changes and no application
code changes. Servlet applications are insulated from changes in vendor or
platform and are able to portably take advantage of standard web
infrastructure services offered by any servlet container.
