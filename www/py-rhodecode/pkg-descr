RhodeCode is a fast and powerful management tool for Mercurial and GIT with a
built in push/pull server and full text search and code-review. It works on
http/https and has a built in permission/authentication system with the ability
to authenticate via LDAP or ActiveDirectory. RhodeCode also provides simple API
so it.s easy integrable with existing external systems.

RhodeCode is similar in some respects to github or bitbucket, however RhodeCode
can be run as standalone hosted application on your own server. It is open
source and donation ware and focuses more on providing a customized, self
administered interface for Mercurial and GIT repositories.
