Note: Analog includes an optional form and perl script to request
analyses via a web interface. The form and script both require
customization before use. If you would like to use them, first copy
%%EXAMPLESDIR%%/etc/anlgform.pl to $$CGI-BIN, and then edit
$$HTDOCS/anlgform.html and $$CGI-BIN/anlgform.pl for your local
configuration. Both files are extensively commented with instructions
for customization.
