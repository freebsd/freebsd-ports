The mod_wsgi adapter is an Apache module that provides a WSGI compliant
interface for hosting Python based web applications within Apache. The
adapter is written completely in C code against the Apache C runtime and
for hosting WSGI applications within Apache has a lower overhead than using
existing WSGI adapters for mod_python or CGI.
