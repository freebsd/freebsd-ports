This project makes it easy to add support for one-time passwords (OTPs) to
Django. It can be integrated at various levels, depending on how much
customization is required. It integrates with django.contrib.auth, although it
is not a Django authentication backend. The primary target is developers
wishing to incorporate OTPs into their Django projects as a form of two-factor
authentication.

This project includes several simple OTP plugins and more are available
separately. This package also includes an implementation of OATH HOTP and TOTP
for convenience, as these are standard OTP algorithms used by multiple
plugins.
