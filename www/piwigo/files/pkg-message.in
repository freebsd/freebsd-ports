****************************************************************
The Piwigo Photo Gallery has been installed in the directory
%%WWWDIR%%
and optionally, with the documentation at
%%DOCSDIR%%
and the content of the tools directory at
%%EXAMPLESDIR%%.

If this is a new installation, don't forget to verify that your
PHP configuration is OK and that you have an MySQL database.
The local directory contains the empty structure
used to store local configuration.

If you are upgrading, alwyas read the documentation
on the site. There may be special steps you need to
bring your site to the new version.

Make sure the ownership and mode of the installation
directores and files match your intended use.

If you included ImageMagick, don't forget to set
$conf['ext_imagick_dir'] = '%%LOCALBASE%%/bin/';
in your local config.

You must add appropriate configuration directives to your
apache configuration file (%%PREFIX%%/etc/apache/httpd.conf).
A typical configuration would be:

    Alias /gallery/ "%%WWWDIR%%/"

    <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%">
	AllowOverride None
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
    </Directory>

For installation and upgrade information, check the readme file.
