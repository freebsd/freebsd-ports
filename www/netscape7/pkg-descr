This is a Linux version of the Netscape suite (Web browser, HTML
editor, mail user agent and news reader). Using the Linux version
on FreeBSD is necessary if you want to use Linux versions of plugins.
Many plugins are distributed only as Linux binaries.

In this port/package, the Java virtual machine is omitted because
it does not work.  AOL Instant Messenger is also omitted (see
ports/net/aim).  Only the U.S. English locale is installed.  Plugins
do not work.  Messenger can be started by going to a mailto: or
news: URL.
