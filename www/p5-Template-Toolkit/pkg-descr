The Template Toolkit is a fast, flexible and highly extensible template
processing system. It is free (in both senses: beer and speech) open source
software and runs on virtually every modern operating system known to man. It
is written in the Perl programming language with certain key elements coded in
C for maximum speed. However you don't need to know any Perl (or C) to be able
to use it.

It is ideally suited, but not limited to, the creation of static and dynamic
web content and incorporates various modules and tools to simplify this
process. It is mature, robust, reliable and well documented.
