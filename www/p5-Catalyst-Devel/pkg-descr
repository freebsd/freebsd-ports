The "Catalyst::Devel" package includes a variety of modules useful for
the development of Catalyst applications, but not required to run them.
This is intended to make it easier to deploy Catalyst apps. The runtime
parts of Catalyst are now known as "Catalyst::Runtime".

"Catalyst::Devel" includes the Catalyst::Helper system, which autogenerates
scripts and tests; Module::Install::Catalyst, a Module::Install extension
for Catalyst; and requirements for a variety of development-related modules.
The documentation remains with Catalyst::Runtime.
