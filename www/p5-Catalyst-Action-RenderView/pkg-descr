This action implements a sensible default end action, which will forward
to the first available view, unless status is set to 3xx, or there is a
response body. It also allows you to pass "dump_info=1" to the url in
order to force a debug screen, while in debug mode.

If you have more than one view, you can specify which one to use with
the "default_view" config setting (see ""$c->view($name)" in "Catalyst".)
