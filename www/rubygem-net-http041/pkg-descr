Net::HTTP provides a rich library which can be used to build HTTP user-agents.
For more details about HTTP see RFC2616.

Net::HTTP is designed to work closely with URI. URI::HTTP#host, URI::HTTP#port
and URI::HTTP#request_uri are designed to work with Net::HTTP.

If you are only performing a few GET requests you should try OpenURI.
