This module prints per-component profiling information to STDERR (usually
    directed to the Apache error log). Its output looks like this:

    =Mason= 127.0.0.1 - /NoAuth/webrt.css BEGINS {{{
    =Mason= 127.0.0.1 -     /NoAuth/webrt.css {{{
    =Mason= 127.0.0.1 -         /Elements/Callback {{{
    =Mason= 127.0.0.1 -         /Elements/Callback }}} 0.0008
    =Mason= 127.0.0.1 -     /NoAuth/webrt.css }}} 0.0072
    =Mason= 127.0.0.1 - /NoAuth/webrt.css }}} ENDS

Each row contains five whitespace-separated fields: =Mason=, remote IP address,
-, indented component name, and how many seconds did it take to process that
component, including all subcomponents called by it.

The beginning and end of the initial request is represented by the special time
fields BEGINS and ENDS.
