jh2, HTTP/2 Protocol Stack, is a fork of the well known hyper/h2 package. We
want to provide a cleaner and faster HTTP/2 state machine while keeping a pure
Python implementation. We decided to embed the leaf dependencies as we want a
neater dependency tree and along with that a easier maintenance burden. We
believe it was a mistake to ship three packages (h2, hpack, and hyperframe).

Analysis shown that h2 spend a lot of time doing hpack encode and decode
operations, this is why we decided to offer a complementary optimized build. The
pure Python version will still be available.

This repository contains a pure-Python implementation of a HTTP/2 protocol
stack. It's written from the ground up to be embeddable in whatever program you
choose to use, ensuring that you can speak HTTP/2 regardless of your programming
paradigm.
