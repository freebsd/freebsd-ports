SWISH-Enhanced is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use system for 
indexing collections of Web pages or other text files. Key features include 
the ability to limit searches to certain HTML tags (META, TITLE, comments, 
etc.). The SWISH-E software is free, and includes a package of Perl programs 
that enable anyone who is authorized to create and maintain their own indexes
(AutoSwish). SWISH-E is an enhanced version of SWISH, which was originally 
written by Kevin Hughes and modified and released with his permission.
