HTTP::AnyUA provides a small wrapper for unifying the programming interfaces of
several different actual user agents (HTTP clients) under one familiar
interface.

Rather than providing yet another programming interface for you to learn,
HTTP::AnyUA follows the HTTP::Tiny interface. This also means that you can plug
in any supported HTTP client (LWP::UserAgent, Furl, etc.) and use it as if it
were HTTP::Tiny.

Unfortunately, many modules on CPAN are hardcoded to work with specific HTTP
clients, leaving the end user unable to use the HTTP client that would be best
for them. Although the end user won't -- or at least doesn't need to -- use
HTTP::AnyUA directly, they will benefit from client choice if their third-party
modules use HTTP::AnyUA or something like it.

The primary goal of HTTP::AnyUA is to make it easy for module developers to
write HTTP code once that can work with any HTTP client the end user may decide
to plug in. A secondary goal is to make it easy for anyone to add support for
new or yet-unsupported user agents.
