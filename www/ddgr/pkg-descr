ddgr is a cmdline utility to search DuckDuckGo from the terminal.

Unlike the web interface, you can specify the number of search
results you would like to see per page. It's more convenient than
skimming through 30-odd search results per page. The default interface
is carefully designed to use minimum space without sacrificing
readability.

ddgr isn't affiliated to DuckDuckGo in any way.
