This is a writable nested model serializer for Django REST Framework which
allows you to create/update your models with related nested data.

The following relations are supported:

- OneToOne (direct/reverse)
- ForeignKey (direct/reverse)
- ManyToMany (direct/reverse excluding m2m relations with through model)
- GenericRelation (this is always only reverse)
