mod_flickr is a apache module (for apache 2.0 and above) that makes call to
flickr via flickr API's to get a users (configured in httpd.conf) public photo
sets, photos in sets and recent photos uploaded in flickr etc...

Currently only 4 api calls have been implmeneted (all are GET calls). These
API's return data in XML format. The XML can then be parsed by the calling code
(e.g. front end Javascript/php) to display thumbnails of the images say in a
scrollbar. (Code for front end is not distributed as yet)

This module can be used by web developers who want to show their photos/albums
uploaded in flickr on their website and/or access to metadata of their photos
for their own needs/purposes.
