The core of every CGI application seems to be roughly the same:
- analyze the incoming parameters, cookies, and URLs to determine the
  state of the application (let's call this "dispatch").
- based on the current state, analyze the incoming parameters to respond
  to any form submitted ("respond").
- from there, decide what response page should be generated, and produce
  it ("render").

CGI::Prototype creates a Class::Prototyped engine for doing all this,
with the right amount of callback hooks to customize the process.
