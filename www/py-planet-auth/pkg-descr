The Planet Auth Library provides generic authentication utilities for clients
and for services. For clients, it provides means to obtain access tokens that
can be used to access network services. For services, it provides tools to
validate the same access tokens.

The Planet SDK for Python leverages this library, and is pre-configured for the
Planet Cloud Service used by customers.
