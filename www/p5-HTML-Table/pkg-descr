HTML::Table is used to generate HTML tables for CGI scripts. By
using the methods provided fairly complex tables can be created,
manipulated, then printed from Perl scripts. The module also greatly
simplifies creating tables within tables from Perl. It is possible
to create an entire table using the methods provided and never use
an HTML tag.

HTML::Table also allows for creating dynamically sized tables via
its addRow and addCol methods.  These methods automatically resize
the table if passed more cell values than will fit in the current
table grid.

Methods are provided for nearly all valid table, row, and cell tags
specified for HTML 3.0.
