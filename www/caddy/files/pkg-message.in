*****************************************************************

www/caddy does not ship with any in-tree documentation. Online
documentation can be found at https://caddyserver.com/docs.

To use www/caddy, create a configuration file in the Caddyfile
format in %%PREFIX%%/www/Caddyfile and enable caddy in your
rc.conf:

# sysrc caddy_enable="YES"
# service caddy start

Example Caddyfile
=================
mysite.com {
    root %%PREFIX%%/www/mysite.com
}

sub.mysite.com {
    root %%PREFIX%%/www/sub.mysite.com
    gzip
    log /var/log/sub.mysite.com/access.log
}

Automatic HTTPS using letsencrypt.org
=====================================

Provide an SSL certificate issuer email in your rc.conf. By
providing an email address you automatically agree to
letsencrypt.org's general terms and conditions:

caddy_cert_email="your.email@example.org"

Telemetry
=========

Since version 0.11.0, caddy includes an optional telemetry
client, which is disabled by this port by default.

If the telemetry client is enabled, you can view global stats
as well as stats from your caddy instance using the instance
uuid (stored in ~/.caddy/uuid unless a different $CADDYPATH
is specified) on https://caddyserver.com/stats.

Specific metrics can be disabled at run-time using the
-disabled-metrics flag.

More information about the Caddy Telemetry Project can be found
at https://caddyserver.com/docs/telemetry.
