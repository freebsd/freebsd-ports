GoTTY is a simple command line tool that turns your CLI tools into web
applications.

GoTTY starts a new process with the given command when a new client connects
to the server. This means users cannot share a single terminal with others by
default. However, you can use terminal multiplexers for sharing a single
process with multiple clients.

For additional security, SSL/TLS client certificate authentication and
session encryption should be used.
