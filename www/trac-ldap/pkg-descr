LDAP support with group management has been added as a Trac extension. This
extension enables to use existing LDAP groups to grant permissions rather than
defining permissions for every single user on the system. The latest release
also permits to store permissions (both users and groups permissions) in the
LDAP directory itself rather than in the SQL backend.
