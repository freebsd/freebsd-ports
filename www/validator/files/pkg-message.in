The W3C Markup Validation Service has been installed. However, it will not do
anything until you set up your web server to utilize it. An httpd.conf for the
Apache web server can be found at
%%WWWDIR%%/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
and included in your Apache web server configuration, typically using:

Include %%WWWDIR%%/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

If you are using another web server, you will have to configure it yourself.
The W3C only recommends the use of the Apache web server, so there are no other
web server configuration snippets.

A sample validator.conf has been installed at
%%WWWDIR%%/htdocs/config/validator.conf.sample
You need to copy this file to
%%WWWDIR%%/htdocs/config/validator.conf
and then edit it to your liking. If you have used a previous version of the
validator, you will need to manually check if anything new has been added to
the W3C's validator.conf and edit your own validator.conf accordingly. If you
would prefer not to put the validator.conf file into
%%WWWDIR%%/htdocs/config,
you can place it where you would like and set the environment variable
W3C_VALIDATOR_CFG to the complete path (including filename) of validator.conf.
An example of how to set this environment variable in Apache has been included
in the above referenced httpd.conf file.
