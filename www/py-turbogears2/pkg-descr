TurboGears 2 is a reinvention of the TurboGears project to take
advantage of new components, and to provide a fully customizable
WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) stack. From the beginning
TurboGears was designed to be a Full Stack framework built from
best-of-breed components. New components have been released which
improved on the ones in the original TGstack, and the Python web
world has been increasingly designed around WSGI.

This has enabled a whole new world of reuse, and TG2 is designed
to take advantage of this fact in order to make a framework which
provides easy to use, productive defaults, while still providing
flexibility where it is useful.

TG2 represents a change from some of the components in TurboGears 1,
but we have now invested in a set of components that we think will
continue to be at the center of python web development for years to
come.
