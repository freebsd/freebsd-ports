TurboGears brings together four major pieces to create an easy to install, easy
to use web megaframework. It covers everything from front end (MochiKit
JavaScript for the browser, Kid for templates in Python) to the controllers
(CherryPy) to the back end (SQLObject).

The TurboGears project is focused on providing documentation and integration
with these tools without losing touch with the communities that already exist
around those tools.

TurboGears is easy to use for a wide range of web applications.
