    This perl module provides an Active Server Pages port to the Apache HTTP
    Server with perl as the host scripting language. Active Server Pages is
    a web application platform that originated with the Microsoft IIS
    server. Under Apache for both Win32 and Unix, it allows a developer to
    create dynamic web applications with session management and perl code
    embedded in static html files.

    This is a portable solution, similar to ActiveState PerlScript and MKS
    PScript implementation of perl for IIS ASP. Work has been done and will
    continue to make ports to and from these other implementations as smooth
    as possible.

    This module works under the Apache HTTP Server with the mod_perl module
    enabled. See http://www.apache.org and http://perl.apache.org for
    further information.

    For database access, ActiveX, and scripting language issues, please read
    the FAQ section.
