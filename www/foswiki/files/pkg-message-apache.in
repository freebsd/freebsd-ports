*********************************************************************
You have just installed Foswiki with a sample Apache configuration
file.

To complete the installation, please:

- Copy %%FOSCONFDIR%%/foswiki.conf.sample to
  %%FOSCONFDIR%%/foswiki.conf 

- Review the contents of %%FOSCONFDIR%%/foswiki.conf
  to ensure they match your local security policies, and modify the
  file if necessary.

- If you want to configure Foswiki from a remote machine, search for the
  following in %%FOSCONFDIR%%/foswiki.conf:

  <FilesMatch "^configure.*">
      SetHandler cgi-script
      Order Deny,Allow
      Deny from all
      Allow from 127.0.0.1
      Require user JohnDoe
      Satisfy Any
  </FilesMatch>

  Add your IP address to the end of the "Allow from 127.0.0.1" line, and
  you will be able to access the configure script without logging in. Make
  sure to remove your IP after you have set up your own user account.

- Restart Apache.

- Browse to the /foswiki URL on your web server and enter the configuration
  page.

- Configure the Foswiki installation according to your needs.

- Visit http://foswiki.org/System/InstallationGuide#Configure_Foswiki for
  additional post-installation configuration information.
