Middleman is a robust proxy server with many features designed
to remove unwanted content, increase privacy, and to simply
make surfing the Web a more pleasant experience. Some of the
highlights of Middleman include banner and popup blocking, HTTP
and FTP content caching, NTLM and Basic authentication when
forwarding through another proxy server, regular expression
substitution in downloaded files and HTTP headers, complete
support for HTTP/1.1 including persistent connections and gzip
encoding, and an intutive Web interface for configuring the
proxy.
