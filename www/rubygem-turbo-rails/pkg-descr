Turbo gives you the speed of a single-page web application without having to
write any JavaScript. Turbo accelerates links and form submissions without
requiring you to change your server-side generated HTML. It lets you carve up a
page into independent frames, which can be lazy-loaded and operate as
independent components. And finally, helps you make partial page updates using
just HTML and a set of CRUD-like container tags. These three techniques reduce
the amount of custom JavaScript that many web applications need to write by an
order of magnitude. And for the few dynamic bits that are left, you're invited
to finish the job with Stimulus.

On top of accelerating web applications, Turbo was built from the ground-up to
form the foundation of hybrid native applications. Write the navigational shell
of your Android or iOS app using the standard platform tooling, then seamlessly
fill in features from the web, following native navigation patterns. Not every
mobile screen needs to be written in Swift or Kotlin to feel native. With Turbo,
you spend less time wrangling JSON, waiting on app stores to approve updates, or
reimplementing features you've already created in HTML.

Turbo is a language-agnostic framework written in TypeScript, but this gem
builds on top of those basics to make the integration with Rails as smooth as
possible. You can deliver turbo updates via model callbacks over Action Cable,
respond to controller actions with native navigation or standard redirects, and
render turbo frames with helpers and layout-free responses.
