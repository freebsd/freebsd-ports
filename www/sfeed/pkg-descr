Sfeed is a RSS and Atom parser (and some format programs).

It converts RSS or Atom feeds from XML to a TAB-separated file. There
are formatting programs included to convert this TAB-separated format to
various other formats. There are also some programs and scripts included
to import and export OPML and to fetch, filter, merge and order feed
items.
