This module is the Perl interface to the SWF Charts flash graphing tool.
It constructs the XML file this flash movie requires via an OO interface.
Each configurable option that is listed on the SWF Charts reference page
has a companion method in this module.

When using this module, please be sure to use the latest version of the
XML/SWF Charts flash movie. Earlier versions of that flash movie supported
a different XML structure for which this module is not backward
compatible.

Note that there are a few extra helper functions that this module
provides.
