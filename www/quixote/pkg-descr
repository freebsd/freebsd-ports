Quixote is yet another framework for developing Web applications in
Python.  The design goals were:

- To allow easy development of Web applications where the accent is more on
  complicated programming logic than complicated templating.
- To make the templating language as similar to Python as possible, in both
  syntax and semantics.  The aim is to make as many of the skills and
  structural techniques used in writing regular Python code applicable to Web
  applications built using Quixote.                   
- No magic.  When it's not obvious what to do in a certain case, Quixote
  refuses to guess.                                  

Quixote works by using a Python package to store all the code and HTML for a
Web-based application.  There's a simple framework for publishing code and
objects on the Web, and the publishing loop can be customized by subclassing
the Publisher class.  You can think of it as a toolkit to build your own
smaller, simpler version of Zope, specialized for your application.
