Regex dispatch types have been depreciated and removed from Catalyst core. It is
recommend that you use Chained methods or other techniques instead. As part of
the refactoring, the dispatch priority of Regex vs Regexp vs LocalRegex vs
LocalRegexp may have changed. Priority is now influenced by when the dispatch
type is first seen in your application.
