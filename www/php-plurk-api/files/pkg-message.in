Plurk API 1.0

**********************************************
Plurk API provides a standard way of accessing
and implementing applications on top of the Plurk
platform. The API is a simple HTTP API that can be
accessed from any language that supports creation
of HTTP requests.

The API returns JSON encoded data. You should use
a JSON library to decode the data returned. Some
good JSON libraries are simplejson (Python),
JSON.simple (Java) or json (Ruby) or json (PHP).

The current limit is 50.000 calls pr. day. If you
need more than this contact us with a description
of what you are making.
