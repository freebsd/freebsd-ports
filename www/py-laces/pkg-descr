Laces components provide a simple way to combine data (in the form of Python
objects) with the Django templates that are meant to render that data. The
components can then be simply rendered in any other template using the {%
component %} template tag. That parent template does not need to know anything
about the component's template or data. No need to receive, filter, restructure
or pass any data to the component's template. Just let the component render
itself.

Template and data are tied together in the component, and they can be passed
around together. This becomes especially useful when components are nested -- it
allows us to avoid building the same nested structure twice (once in the data
and again in the templates).

Working with objects that know how to render themselves as HTML elements is a
common pattern found in complex Django applications, such as the Wagtail admin
interface. The Wagtail admin is also where the APIs provided in this package
have previously been discovered, developed and solidified. The purpose of this
package is to make these tools available to other Django projects outside the
Wagtail ecosystem.
