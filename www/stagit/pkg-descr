stagit is a static Git web page generator with the following features:

- Log of all commits from HEAD.
- Log and diffstat per commit.
- Show file tree with linkable line numbers.
- Show references: local branches and tags.
- Detect README and LICENSE file from HEAD and link it as a webpage.
- Detect submodules (.gitmodules file) from HEAD and link it as a
  webpage.
- Atom feed log (atom.xml).
- Make index page for multiple repositories with stagit-index.
- After generating the pages (relatively slow) serving the files is
  very fast, simple and requires little resources (because the content
  is static), only a HTTP file server is required.
