Quilt is for data-driven teams and offers features for coders (data scientists,
data engineers, developers) and business users alike.

Quilt consists of a Python client, web catalog, lambda functions -- all of which
are open source -- plus a suite of backend services and Docker containers
orchestrated by CloudFormation.
