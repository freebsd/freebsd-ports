An Apache module that implements the client side of the Simple Common
Gateway Interface protocol.

The SCGI protocol is a replacement for the Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) protocol.  It is a standard for applications to interface with
HTTP servers.  It is similar to FastCGI but is designed to be easier to
implement.
