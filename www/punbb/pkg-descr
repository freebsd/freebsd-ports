PunBB is a fast and lightweight PHP-powered discussion board. It is
released under the GNU General Public License. Its primary goals are
to be faster, smaller and less graphically intensive as compared to
other discussion boards. PunBB has fewer features than many other
discussion boards, but is generally faster and outputs smaller,
semantically correct XHTML-compliant pages.
