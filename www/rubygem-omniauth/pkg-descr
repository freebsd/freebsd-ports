OmniAuth is a library that standardizes multi-provider authentication for
web applications. It was created to be powerful, flexible, and do as
little as possible. Any developer can create **strategies** for OmniAuth
that can authenticate users via disparate systems. OmniAuth strategies
have been created for everything from Facebook to LDAP.
