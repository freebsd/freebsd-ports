Falkon is a very fast web browser that uses QtWebEngine, and aims to be
lightweight on all major platforms.  It has all the standard functions
that are expected from a web browser, including bookmarks, history,
sidebar, and tabs.  Plus: integral AdBlock, and edition of the local CA
Certificates database with an SSL Manager.

Falkon has a wide range of features that are supported by KDE
Frameworks, and many integration points with KDE Plasma.

The "-qtonly" flavor omits these features:
- spellchecking
- word completion
- crash reporting
- progress notifications
- KIO (virtual filesystem) support
- wallet integration
- content sharing.
