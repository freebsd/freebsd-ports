Falkon is a very fast web browser that uses QtWebEngine, and aims to be
lightweight on all major platforms. It has all the standard functions
that are expected from a web browser, including bookmarks, history,
sidebar, and tabs. Plus: integral AdBlock, and editing of the local CA
certificate database with an SSL manager.

Falkon has a wide range of features that are supported by KDE
Frameworks, and many integration points with KDE Plasma.

The "qtonly" flavor omits these features:
- spellchecking
- word completion
- crash reporting
- progress notifications
- KIO (virtual filesystem) support
- wallet integration
- content sharing.
