Typhoeus runs HTTP requests in parallel while
cleanly encapsulating handling logic.

It's a library for accessing web services in Ruby,
specifically designed for building RESTful service
oriented architectures in Ruby that need to be fast
enough to process calls to multiple services within
the client's HTTP request/response life cycle.
