  WML is a free and extensible Webdesigner's off-line HTML generation toolkit
  for Unix, distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL v2). It is
  written in ANSI C and Perl 5, build via a GNU Autoconf based source tree
  and runs out-of-the-box on all major Unix derivates.  It can be used
  free of charge both in educational and commercial environments.
  
  WML consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends in a
  sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme. Each backend provides one
  particular core language. For maximum power WML additionally ships with a
  well-suited set of include files which provide higher-level features build
  on top of the backends core languages. While not trivial and idiot proof WML
  provides most of the core features real hackers always wanted for HTML
  generation.
