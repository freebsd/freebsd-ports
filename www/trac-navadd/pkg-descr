This plugin allows you to add custom items ("buttons") to both the main
and the meta navigation bar. Item name, title and URL can be specified
in trac.ini, as well as an optional permission the user is required to
have to see the item.

The plugin was inspired by and derived from NavMoverPlugin. In contrast
to NavMoverPlugin this plugin does not hide navigation bars.
