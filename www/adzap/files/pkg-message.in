  Adzap has now been installed.  To get it up and running, copy
  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/adzap.conf to %%PREFIX%%/etc/ and
  modify it to match your setup.  Then edit your squid configuration
  and add %%PREFIX%%/libexec/adzap as your http-redirector.

  If you run a web server, you can copy files from
  %%PREFIX%%/share/examples/adzap/zaps to your htdocs tree and
  modify the web locations in %%PREFIX%%/etc/adzap.conf accordingly.

  You can find JavaScript proxy auto-configuration scripts in
