Arora is a simple cross platform web browser. Currently Arora is a
very basic browser whose feature list includes things like "History"
and "Bookmarks". It does not have support for netscape plugins, so
no flash support until Qt 4.5. But it is small, less than 10,000
lines of code, very fast, lean, mean and loads of fun to hack on.
Arora and QtWebKit is developed to be cross-platform using the Qt
library. It was originally created as a demo for Qt to help test
the QtWebKit component and find API issues and bugs before the
release.
