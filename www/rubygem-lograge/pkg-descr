Tame Rails' multi-line logging into a single line per request

Lograge is an attempt to bring sanity to Rails' noisy and unusable, unparsable
and, in the context of running multiple processes and servers, unreadable
default logging output.  Rails' default approach to log everything is great
during development, it's terrible when running it in production.
