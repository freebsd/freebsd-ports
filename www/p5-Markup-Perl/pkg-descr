This perl module allows the embedding of perl code within CGI scripts
using simple tags, <perl> and </perl>, to begin and end perl parsing.
Once the perl module is included via "use", all text gets output to
stdout except for code within the above tags.

Despite what's in the CPAN README, this module does not require
Filter::Simple, only CGI.pm.
