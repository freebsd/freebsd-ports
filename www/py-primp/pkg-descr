PRIMP (Python Requests IMPersonate) is a high-performance HTTP client library
for Python, designed to mimic the behavior of real web browsers. It extends
the popular `requests` library by adding advanced impersonation capabilities.

Key features include:
* Browser Fingerprinting**: Mimics TLS and HTTP/2 fingerprints of various
  popular web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to evade detection by
  anti-bot systems.
* High Performance**: Optimized for speed, making it suitable for demanding
  web scraping and automation tasks.
* Ease of Use**: Maintains the familiar and user-friendly API of the
  `requests` library.

PRIMP is ideal for developers and researchers who need to interact with websites
that employ sophisticated bot detection mechanisms, enabling more robust web
scraping, automated testing, and data collection.
