CGI.pm is a stable, complete and mature solution for processing and preparing
HTTP requests and responses. Major features including processing form
submissions, file uploads, reading and writing cookies, query string generation
and manipulation, and processing and preparing HTTP headers.

CGI.pm performs very well in a vanilla CGI.pm environment and also comes with
built-in support for mod_perl and mod_perl2 as well as FastCGI.

It has the benefit of having developed and refined over 20 years with input from
dozens of contributors and being deployed on thousands of websites. CGI.pm was
included in the perl distribution from perl v5.4 to v5.20, however is has now
been removed from the perl core.
