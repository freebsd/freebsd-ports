RDF.rb is a pure-Ruby library for working with Resource Description
Framework (RDF) data.

Features:
* 100% pure Ruby with minimal dependencies and no bloat.
* Fully compatible with RDF 1.1 specifications.
* 100% free and unencumbered public domain software.
* Provides a clean, well-designed RDF object model and related APIs.
* Supports parsing and serializing N-Triples and N-Quads out of the box, with
  more serialization format support available through add-on extensions.
* Includes in-memory graph and repository implementations, with more storage
  adapter support available through add-on extensions.
* Implements basic graph pattern (BGP) query evaluation.
* Plays nice with others: entirely contained in the RDF module, and does not
  modify any of Ruby's core classes or standard library.
* Based entirely on Ruby's autoloading, meaning that you can generally make use
  of any one part of the library without needing to load up the rest.
* Compatible with Ruby Ruby 2.x, Rubinius and JRuby 1.7+ (in Ruby 2.0 mode).
* Performs auto-detection of input to select appropriate Reader class if one can
  not be determined from file characteristics.
