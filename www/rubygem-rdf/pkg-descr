RDF.rb is a pure-Ruby library for working with Resource Description Framework
(RDF) data.

Features:
- 100% pure Ruby with minimal dependencies and no bloat.
- Fully compatible with RDF 1.1 specifications.
- 100% free and unencumbered public domain software.
- Provides a clean, well-designed RDF object model and related APIs.
- Supports parsing and serializing N-Triples and N-Quads out of the box, with
  more serialization format support available through add-on extensions.
- Includes in-memory graph and repository implementations, with more storage
  adapter support available through add-on extensions.
- Implements basic graph pattern (BGP) query evaluation.
- Plays nice with others: entirely contained in the RDF module, and does not
  modify any of Ruby's core classes or standard library.
- Based entirely on Ruby's autoloading, meaning that you can generally make use
  of any one part of the library without needing to load up the rest.
- Compatible with Ruby Ruby >= 2.4, Rubinius and JRuby 9.0+.
- Performs auto-detection of input to select appropriate Reader class if one
  cannot be determined from file characteristics.
- Provisional support for RDF*.
