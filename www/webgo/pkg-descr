web.go is the simplest way to write web applications in the Go programming
language. It's ideal for writing simple, performant backend web services.

web.go should be familiar to people who've developed websites with higher-level
web frameworks like sinatra, pylons, or web.py. It is designed to be a
lightweight web framework that doesn't impose any scaffolding on the user.

Some features include:

    * Routing to url handlers based on regular expressions
    * Secure cookies
    * Support for fastcgi and scgi
    * Web applications are compiled to native code. This means very fast
execution and page render speed
    * Serving static files
