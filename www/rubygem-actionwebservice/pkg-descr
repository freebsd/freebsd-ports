Action Web Service

Action Web Service provides a way to publish interoperable web service APIs with
Rails without spending a lot of time delving into protocol details.

Features

* SOAP RPC protocol support
* Dynamic WSDL generation for APIs
* XML-RPC protocol support
* Clients that use the same API definitions as the server for
  easy interoperability with other Action Web Service based applications
* Type signature hints to improve interoperability with static languages
* Active Record model class support in signatures
