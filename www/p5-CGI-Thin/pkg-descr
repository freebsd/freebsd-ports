This module is a very lightweight parser of CGI forms. And it has a special
feature that it will return an array if the same key is used twice in the
form.  You can force an array even if only one value returned to avoid
complications.

The hash %cgi_data will have all the form data from either a POST or GET form
and will also work for "multipart/form-data" forms necessary for uploading
files.
