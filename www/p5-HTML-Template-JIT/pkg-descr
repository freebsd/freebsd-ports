This module provides a just-in-time compiler for HTML::Template.

If your template needs to be compiled - either because it has changed
or because it has never been compiled - then HTML::Template::JIT uses
HTML::Template and Inline::C to compile your template to native
machine instructions.

The resulting compiled template is much faster than a normal cached
template.  Benchmarks show HTML::Template::JIT, with a precompiled
template, performing 4 to 8 times faster than HTML::Template in cache
mode.
