Puma is a simple, fast, threaded, and highly concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for
Ruby/Rack applications. Puma is intended for use in both development and
production environments. In order to get the best throughput, it is highly
recommended that you use a Ruby implementation with real threads like Rubinius
or JRuby.
