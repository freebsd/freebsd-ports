From the README:

 HTMLgen is a class library for the generation of HTML documents with
 Python scripts. It's used when you want to create HTML pages
 containing information which changes from time to time. For example
 you might want to have a page which provides an overall system summary
 of data collected nightly. Or maybe you have a catalog of data and
 images that you would like formed into a spiffy set of web pages for
 the world to browse. Python is a great scripting language for these
 tasks and with HTMLgen it's very straightforward to construct objects
 which are rendered into consistently structured web pages. Of course,
 CGI scripts written in Python can take advantage of these classes as
 well.
