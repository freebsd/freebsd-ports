CHTML works by transforming static HTML documents residing on the server into
dynamic HTML documents that are actually seen by the user.  This is similar to
but different from server-side-include (e.g. shtml) or web-sql/gsql mechanisms
in that it:

      * avoids embedding into HTML the kinds of directives which only
        programmers would be comfortable with.
      * avoids overly extending HTML semantics in a way that prevents the
        documents from being edited by wysiwyg tools.
      * only uses templates that are complete and valid stand-alone HTML
        documents. Therefore the documents can be verified as to HTML
        level conformance independently from running the scripts that use them.
