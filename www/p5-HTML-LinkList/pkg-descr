This module contains a number of functions for taking sets of URLs and
labels and creating suitably formatted HTML.  These links are "smart"
because, if given the url of the current page, if any of the links in
the list equal it, that item in the list will be formatted as a special
label, not as a link; this is a Good Thing, since the user would be
confused by clicking on a link back to the current page.
