WSGI request delegation. (AKA routing.)

This distribution provides WSGI middleware for "RESTful" dispatch of
requests to WSGI applications by URL path and HTTP request
method. Selector now also comes with components for environ-based
dispatch and on-the-fly middleware composition. There is a very simple
optional mini-language for path matching expressions. Alternately we
can easily use regular expressions directly or even create our own
mini-language. There is a simple "mapping file" format that can be
used. There are no architecture specific features (to MVC or
whatever). Neither are there any framework specific features.
