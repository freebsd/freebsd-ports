WSGI request delegation. (AKA routing.)

This distribution provides WSGI middleware for “RESTful” mapping of URL paths to
WSGI applications. Selector now also comes with components for environ based
dispatch and on-the-fly middleware composition. There is a very simple optional
mini-language for path expressions. Alternately we can easily use regular
expressions directly or even create our own mini-language. There is a simple
“mapping file” format that can be used. There are no architecture specific
features (to MVC or whatever). Neither are there any framework specific
features.
