WebMake is a simple, Perl based content management system for websites.
It is based around a templating system for HTML documents, with lots of
built-in smarts about what a ``typical'' informational website needs
in the way of functionality, metadata, sitemapping, navigational aids,
and (of course) embedded perl code.
