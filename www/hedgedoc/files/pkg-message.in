Congratulations, you have installed Hedgedoc!

To enable hedgedoc you need to add following to your /etc/rc.conf:

	hedgedoc_enable=YES
	# hedgedoc_port=3000

- config samples are located in %%PREFIX%%/etc/hedgedoc/
- customise config.json before running %%PORTNAME%%
- most settings can be provided in the json file, or via env vars
- the sqlite database option stores files in /var/db/%%PORTNAME%%
- using a reverse proxy in front of %%PORTNAME%% is strongly advised;
  see https://docs.hedgedoc.org/guides/reverse-proxy/ for details
- the default HTTP port is 3000

After installation, modify config.json to match your site, referring
to docs or to the community support forums:

https://docs.hedgedoc.org/
https://community.hedgedoc.org/

In most cases, it is sufficient to trim out all settings you do not
require, set allowOrigin, domain, host, DB, and any third-pary auth
such as ldap or github, that you require.

See https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/dialects.html for details on
configuring DB access, this port supports PostgreSQL and SQLite.
