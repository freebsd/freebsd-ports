The best platform to write and share markdown.

HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source, web-based,
self-hosted, collaborative markdown editor.

You can use it to easily collaborate on notes, graphs and even
presentations in real-time. All you need to do is to share your
note-link to your co-workers and they're ready to go.
