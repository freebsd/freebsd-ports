==================================================================
b2evolution is now installed. If you install it for the first time,
you may need to perform the following steps.

1. Make sure your mysql-server is running.

2. Create a new MySQL database:

   # mysqladmin --user=root -p create b2evolution

   (in mysql root's password is empty unless you have set it in advance).

3. Create a mysql user/password for the b2evolution database:
  (change user and/or password if required)

   # mysql -u root -p
   mysql> GRANT ALL ON b2evolution.* TO b2evouser@localhost
 	  IDENTIFIED BY 'b2evopassword';
   mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   mysql> QUIT;

4. Add the following to your apache config, and restart.
   #
   # Directives to allow use of b2evolution
   #
   Alias /%%B2EVO_URL%% "%%PREFIX%%/%%B2EVO_DIR%%/"
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory /usr/local/www/Wikka-1.2>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>
   #

5. Open b2evo installation page in your web browser
   and login with b2evouser/b2evopassword

   http://www.your.host/%%B2EVO_URL%%/blogs/install/

   (if you are doing a fresh install...)
   Note that password carefully! It is a random password that is given to you
   when you install b2evolution.
   If you lose it, you will have to delete the database tables and reinstall.

   If you upgrade from b2evolution version 1.x.y you may need to upgrade
   your database as described at
