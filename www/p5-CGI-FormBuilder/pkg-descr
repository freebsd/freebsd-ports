The goal of CGI::FormBuilder (FormBuilder) is to provide an easy way
for you to generate and process entire CGI form-based applications.
Its main features are:

* Field Abstraction
  Viewing fields as entities (instead of just params), where the HTML
  representation, CGI values, validation, and so on are properties of
  each field.
* DWIMmery
  Lots of built-in "intelligence" (such as automatic field typing),
  giving you about a 4:1 ratio of the code it generates versus what
  you have to write.
* Built-in Validation
  Full-blown regex validation for fields, even including JavaScript
  code generation.
* Template Support
  Pluggable support for external template engines, such as
  HTML::Template, Text::Template, Template Toolkit, and
  CGI::FastTemplate.

Plus, the native HTML generated is valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional.
