Baikal is a lightweight CalDAV and CardDAV server. It is
compatible with the calendar and contacts apps from Apple's
iOS and OS X, Android, Evolution, Mozilla Thunderbird, and
any other CalDAV/CardDAV capable application. Baikal supports
authentication with multiple users and calendars, and comes
with a spiffy web-based administration interface.

Baikal does not start a daemon or open any ports. It must
run at the root of a VirtualHost or subdomain. See the included
sample Apache and Nginx configurations, and INSTALL.md for all
the gory details.
