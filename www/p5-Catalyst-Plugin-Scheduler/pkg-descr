This plugin allows you to schedule events to run at recurring
intervals. Events will run during the first request which meets or
exceeds the specified time.  Depending on the level of traffic to the
application, events may or may not run at exactly the correct time,
but it should be enough to satisfy many basic scheduling needs.
