===>  COMPATIBILITY NOTE:
      As of version 1.3.24, the RedirectMatch directive requires an
      absolute URL target location per RFC 2068. Uses of RedirectMatch that
      specify a relative URL will fail and must be corrected to function.

===>  BE CAREFULL HOW TO BOOT on 1.3.29_2 or after:
	To run apache www server from startup, add apache_enable="YES"
	in your /etc/rc.conf.
