Hassle-free npm pack including all dependencies for offline installation
with npm install

Add offline-npm to your project to serve a npm compatible tgz file
which contains all dependencies for offline installation with npm install.

Additionally you can use offline-npm -n to install packages from your
local npm cache directory (could be useful e.g. on travelling).
