WebService::GData is a blueprint that you should inherit and extend. It offers a
basic hashed based object creation via the word new.

All sub classes should be hash based. If you want to pock into the instance,
it's easy but everything that is not documented should be considered private. If
you play around with undocumented properties/methods and that it changes,
upgrading to the new version with all the extra new killer features will be very
hard to do.
