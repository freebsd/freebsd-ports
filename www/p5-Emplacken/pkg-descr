Emplacken is a tool for managing a set of Plack applications based on
config files. It also adds support for privilege dropping and error
logs to those Plack servers that don't support these features
natively.

It works be reading a config file and using that to generate a PSGI
application file based on your config. It knows how to generate
Catalyst, Mojo, and Mason app files natively. For other apps, or more
complicated setups, you can supply a template to Emplacken and it
will use that to generate the PSGI app.
