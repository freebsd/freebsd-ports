It's two in the morning and someone posted a link to your website on
slashdot.  Don't panic, it takes only a minute to set up Varnish in
front of your web server:

1) Install Varnish
2) Reconfigure your web server to listen on localhost:8080
3) sysrc varnishd_enable=YES
4) service varnishd start

Refer to the documentation for more advanced configuration.
