PyBlosxom is a lightweight weblog system. It originally started out as
a Python clone of Blosxom but has since evolved into a beast of its
own. PyBlosxom focuses on three things: simplicity, extensibility, and
community.

simplicity - PyBlosxom uses the file system for all its data
storage. Because of this you can use whatever editor you want to use
to create, update, and manipulate entries.

extensibility - PyBlosxom has plugin framework allowing you to build
plugins in Python to augment and change PyBlosxom's default behavior.

community - There are hundreds of PyBlosxom users out there all of
whom have different needs. PyBlosxom is used on a variety of operating
systems in a variety of environments.

PyBlosxom is a pretty straight-forward system that allows you to do
the things you need to do without building everything from scratch.
