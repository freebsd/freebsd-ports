Rose::HTML::Objects is a framework for creating a reusable set of HTML
widgets as mutable Perl objects that can be serialized to HTML or XHTML
for display purposes.

The Rose::HTML::Object class may be used directly to represent a generic
tag with an explicitly set element name and arbitrary attributes. There
are also methods for parent/child manipulation.
