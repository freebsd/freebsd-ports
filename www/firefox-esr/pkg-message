## Missing features

Some features found on Windows, macOS and Linux are not implemented:

- Encrypted Media Extensions (requires Widevine CDM binary)
- Process sandboxing (requires Capsicum backend)
- Reduced memory usage (requires mozjemalloc)
- Crash Reporter (requires Google Breakpad and reproducible builds)
- WebVR (requires open source runtime)
- `about:networking#networkid` (requires link state notification)

## Cursors

From Firefox 140.2 on, this port defaults to using the new (themed)
cursor selection. On the upside, this makes Firefox respect the
desktop environment's theme, on the downside this breaks compatibility
with the legacy X cursor names. If you experience issues (i.e. the
mouse cursor not changing to the pointer ("hand") when hovering over
links), your desktop environment is most likely still set to the legacy
default/builtin "theme". To remedy this, either
- set about:config variable "widget.gtk.legacy-cursors.enabled" to "true"
  to re-enable the legacy cursors, or
- use the Xcursor framework to set a cursor theme (e.g. X resource
  item Xcursor.theme), see Xcursor(3) for details. The Adwaita theme
  will have been installed as a dependency of gtk3 and does work.
The latter option is only available for X environments.

## Audio backend

Currently used audio backend can be inspected on `about:support` page.
Supported backends and default probing order is as follows:
- `pulse-rust` if `pulseaudio` package is installed (PULSEAUDIO option)
- `jack` if `jackit` package is installed (JACK option)
- `sndio` if `sndio` package is installed (SNDIO option)
- `alsa` if `alsa-lib` package is installed (ALSA option)
- `oss` (always available)
To force a specific backend open `about:config` page and create
`media.cubeb.backend` preference.

Microphone selection only works in `oss`, `pulse-rust` backends.
Other backends are limited to `default` which is usually `/dev/dsp`,
so use virtual_oss to reroute microphones from non-default devices.

## Gamepad API

Requires evdev(4) joystick support. On FreeBSD 13 and later enable hgame(4)
while older versions can use sysutils/iichid or multimedia/webcamd.

## smb:// issues
Network group, machine, and share browsing does not work correctly.

## sftp://
Only sftp access using public key authentication works. To easily
setup public key authentication to `remote_host`:

    $ ssh-keygen
    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_host "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

The SSH server on `remote_host` must allow pub key authentication.
