    Bug 1338655 - Don't try to build mp4parse bindings. r=froydnj
    
    We use the cheddar crate to generate a C header file
    for our mp4parse_capi wrapper crate. Currently we
    do this at code check-in time via update-rust.sh.
    
    Cargo 0.18 and later will try to execute a build.rs
    file in the crate source tree regardless of whether
    it's specified in Cargo.toml so patching out that
    line just results in 'crate cheddar not found'.
    
    This change restores the old behaviour by substituting
    a 'build = false' line instead.
    
    We do have syntex vendored, but we don't currently build
    it by default, so I prefer this solution to just vendoring
    cheddar and generating the header at build time. The syntex
    crate is quite large and adds significantly to our compile
    time.
