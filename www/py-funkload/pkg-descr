FunkLoad is a functional and load web tester, written in Python,
whose main use cases are:

* Functional testing of web projects, and thus regression testing as well.
* Performance testing: by loading the web application and monitoring your
  servers it helps you to pinpoint bottlenecks, giving a detailed report of
  performance measurement.
* Load testing tool to expose bugs that do not surface in cursory testing,
  like volume testing or longevity testing.
* Stress testing tool to overwhelm the web application resources and test the
  application recoverability.
* Writing web agents by scripting any web repetitive task, like checking if
  a site is alive.
