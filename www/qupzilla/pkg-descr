QupZilla is a new and very fast QtWebKit browser. It aims to be a lightweight
web browser available through all major platforms. This project has been
originally started only for educational purposes. But from its start, QupZilla
has grown into a feature-rich browser.

QupZilla has all standard functions you expect from a web browser. It includes
bookmarks, history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Above that, you can manage
RSS feeds with an included RSS reader, block ads with a builtin AdBlock plugin,
block Flash content with Click2Flash and edit the local CA Certificates
database with an SSL Manager.

QupZilla's main aim is to be a very fast and very stable QtWebKit browser
available to everyone.  There are already a lot of QtWebKit browsers available,
but they are either bound to the KDE environment (rekonq), are not actively
developed or very unstable and miss important features. But there is missing a
multiplatform, modern and actively developed browser. QupZilla is trying to
fill this gap by providing a very stable browsing experience.
