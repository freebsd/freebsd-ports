                       Apache + OpenSSL (Apache-SSL)

Uses the public domain SSL implementation known as OpenSSL, integrated
into the Apache server to provide a public domain HTTPS server using
Netscape Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), versions 2 and 3 and TLS version
1.  There are licensing issues in connection with use of the OpenSSL
code in the US, and there are ITAR restrictions on export, even though
the OpenSSL code is obtained from an overseas location.
