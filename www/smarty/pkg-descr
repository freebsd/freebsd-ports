Smarty is a template engine for PHP. Many other template engines for PHP
provide  basic variable  substitution and  dynamic block  functionality.
Smarty takes  a step  further to  be a  "smart" template  engine, adding
features such  as configuration files, template  functions, and variable
modifiers, and making  all of this functionality as easy  as possible to
use for  both programmers and  template designers. Smarty  also converts
the  templates into  PHP  scripts,  eliminating the  need  to parse  the
templates on every invocation. This  makes Smarty extremely scalable and
managable for large application needs.
