YOURLS stands for Your Own URL Shortener. It is a small set of PHP scripts that
will allow you to run your own URL shortening service (a la TinyURL or bitly).

Running your own URL shortener is fun, geeky and useful: you own your data and
don't depend on third party services. It's also a great way to add branding to
your short URLs, instead of using the same public URL shortener everyone uses.
