This extension makes all html textareas into a very
stripped-down version of Vi[m]. It's modal, supports
infinite undo, has register support, search, visual
mode, and various movement and editing commands
There's a lot yet to implement, but I've tried to
cover all the basics that you'd use every day to type
an email, edit a wiki page, etc. That being said,
you'll note that the version number hasn't hit 1.0
yet.

If you like the power of ItsAllText, but want something
a bit lighter-weight, give it a try.
