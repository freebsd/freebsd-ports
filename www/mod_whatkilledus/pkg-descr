mod_whatkilledus is an experimental module for Apache httpd 2.x which
tracks the current request and logs a report of the active request
when a child process crashes.

Requirements: Apache httpd >= 2.0.49 must be built with the
--enable-exception-hook configure option and mod_so enabled.

Activating mod_whatkilledus:

  1. Load it like any other DSO.
	LoadModule whatkilledus_module modules/mod_whatkilledus.so

  2. Enable exception hooks for modules like mod_whatkilledus:
	EnableExceptionHook On

  3. Choose where the report on current activity should be written. If
     you want it reported to some place other than the error log, use the
     WhatKilledUsLog directive to specify a fully-qualified filename for
     the log.  Note that the web server user id (e.g., "nobody") must
     be able to create or append to this log file, as the log file is
     not opened until a crash occurs.
