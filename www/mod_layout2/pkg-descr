mod_layout is a utility to wrap served webpages. This means it can
add a footer or header to a document. This allows you to create a
standard look and feel throughout a website without using SSI.
Some example uses are adding standard disclaimers to the bottom of
all pages, banner ads to the top of all pages, or even a menu at
the beginning of a page. There are many other per-document settings
you can modify with mod_layout; Currently this mod_layout version
is still an alpha version. But it can be used in production 
environment for people who need Apache 2.0.x.
THIS VERSION IS ONLY FOR APACHE 2.0.X
New mod_layout features won't be backported to mod_layout 3.x designed
for apache 1.3.x.
