Net::Async::HTTP implements an asynchronous HTTP user agent. It sends requests
to servers, returning Future instances to yield responses when they are
received. The object supports multiple concurrent connections to servers, and
allows multiple requests in the pipeline to any one connection. Normally, only
one such object will be needed per program to support any number of requests.

As well as using futures the module also supports a callback-based interface.

Net::Async::HTTP optionally supports SSL connections, if IO::Async::SSL is
installed. If so, SSL can be requested either by passing a URI with the https
scheme, or by passing a true value as the SSL parameter.
