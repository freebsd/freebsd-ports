This module contains two plugins for Dancer: Dancer::Plugin::RPC::XMLRPC
and Dancer::Plugin::RPC::JSONRPC. They are plugins rather than
Plack::Middleware.
 
Dancer::Plugin::RPC::XMLRPC
 
This plugin exposes the new keyword "xmlrpc" that is followed by 2
arguments: the endpoint and the arguments to configure the xmlrpc-calls
at this endpoint.
 
Dancer::Plugin::RPC::JSONRPC
 
This plugin exposes the new keyword "jsonrpc" that is followed by
2 arguments: the endpoint and the arguments to configure the
jsonrpc-calls at this endpoint.

See the /t dir for examples (until some tutorial exists)
