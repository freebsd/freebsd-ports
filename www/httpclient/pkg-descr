HttpClient provides components for client-side authentication, HTTP state
management, connection management, and an HTTP/1.1 compliant HTTP agent
implementation based on those components. It is intended as successor of
and replacement for Jakarta Commons HttpClient 3.x.

The HttpClient module is a full-featured, HTTP/1.1 compliant agent built
on top of HttpCore.

The HttpMime module extends mime4j library with some HTTP specific
functionality and integrates it with the HttpComponents framework.
