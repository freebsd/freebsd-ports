Eclipse Enterprise for Java

Eclipse GlassFish is a complete application server that implements the Jakarta
EE specification. GlassFish includes implementations of all required and
optional Jakarta EE APIs, and passes all Jakarta EE TCKs. GlassFish also
includes a complete administration console, clustering support, and other
developer and production focused tools and features.

The release marks the transition to the latest version of the Java Platform,
so we dropped support for Java 11, and are now supporting Java 25 instead.
GlassFish 7.1.0 introduces support for Microprofile Health, switches
keystores from JKS to PKCS12, the current industry standard, and adapted
server bootstrap to JPMS.
