If you want to have the h2 module enabled in your apache installation,
you need to add

   LoadModule http2_module modules/mod_h2.so

somewhere in your config files and add a line like

   H2Engine on

whereever you want the module to be active (general server of specific
virtual hosts).

NB: The shared libraries were renamed from mod_http2 to mod_h2 to
    avoid conflicts with the (now bundled) mod_http2 in www/apache24
