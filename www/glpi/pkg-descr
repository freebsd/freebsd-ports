GLPI is an Information Resource-Manager with an additional
Administration- Interface. You can use it to build up a
database with an inventory for your company (computer,
software, printers...). It has enhanced functions to make
the daily life for the administrators easier, like a job-
tracking-system with mail-notification and methods to build
a database with basic information about your network-topology.
