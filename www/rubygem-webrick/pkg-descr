WEBrick is an HTTP server toolkit that can be configured as an HTTPS server, a
proxy server, and a virtual-host server.

WEBrick features complete logging of both server operations and HTTP access.

WEBrick supports both basic and digest authentication in addition to algorithms
not in RFC 2617.

A WEBrick server can be composed of multiple WEBrick servers or servlets to
provide differing behavior on a per-host or per-path basis. WEBrick includes
servlets for handling CGI scripts, ERB pages, Ruby blocks and directory
listings.

WEBrick also includes tools for daemonizing a process and starting a process at
a higher privilege level and dropping permissions.
