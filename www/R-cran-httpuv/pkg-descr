httpuv provides low-level socket and protocol support for handling
HTTP and WebSocket requests directly from within R. It is primarily
intended as a building block for other packages, rather than making
it particularly easy to create complete web applications using
httpuv alone. httpuv is built on top of the libuv and http-parser
C libraries, both of which were developed by Joyent, Inc.
