   needed for a page and following redirects
2. Cookies stored and trackable (all automatically handled)
3. HTTP, HTTPS, GET, POST, basic auth all handled, control over expected status
   codes, ...
4. DOM parsing of pages to retrieve and analyse structure, including simple
   form re-posting
5. Two-line page-fetch followed by form-submit possible, with error checking
6. Ability to register error page content across multiple tests
