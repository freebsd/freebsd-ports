****************************************************************
vtiger is installed in ${PREFIX}/www/vtiger.

You need to create an MySQL database called vtiger, and an user
vtiger which is allowed to acces the database from localhost.

Then, setup a virtual host in your webserver which has DocumentRoot
to ${PREFIX}/www/vtiger. If your php.ini states that all errors
should go to the users webbrowser, better turn that off now:
    php_flag display_errors Off

Connect to that virtual host with your webbrowser and run the
installation script. After the creation of config.php, you can edit
it and properly configure the db_name, db_user_name and db_password.

The rest of the installation should go smoothly.
