Protocol::XMLRPC is an XML-RPC protocol implementation. Method parameters types
are guessed just like in JSON, but you can pass explicit type if guessing is
wrong for you. Read more about parameter creation at
Protocol::XMLRPC::ValueFactory.

It differs from other modules because it doesn't provide any mechanism for
making actual HTTP requests. This way it can be used either in async or sync
modes with your favorite http client or a web framework.
