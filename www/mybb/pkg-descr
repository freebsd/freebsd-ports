MyBB is a discussion board that has been around for a while; it has evolved
from other bulletin boards into the forum package it is today. Therefore,
it is a professional and efficient discussion board, developed by an active
team of developers. The MyBB history has been recorded and is available for
the interested to read. You can also read more about the MyBB team and why
they develop MyBB in their spare time. We also like to highlight the most
active and contributing fansites of the MyBB community.
