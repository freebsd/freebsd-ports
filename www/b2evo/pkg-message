==================================================================
b2evolution is now installed. If you intall it for the first time,
you may have to follow this steps to make it work correctly.

1. Create the MySQL database:

  # mysqladmin --user=root -p create b2evolution

2. Create a mysql user/password for b2evolution(database):
  (change user and/or password if requered)

  # mysql -u root -p
  mysql> GRANT ALL ON b2evolution.* TO b2evouser@localhost 
	 IDENTIFIED BY 'b2evopassword';
  mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  mysql> QUIT;

3.Open b2evo installation page in your web browser 
  and login with b2evouser/b2evopassword

  http://%%HOSTNAME%%/%%B2EVO_URL%%/blogs/install/

  If you are doing a fresh install...
  Note that password carefully! It is a random password that is given to you 
  when you install b2evolution.
  If you lose it, you will have to delete the database tables and reinstall.

  Have fun!
