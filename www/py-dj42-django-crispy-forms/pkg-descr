The best way to have Django DRY forms. Build programmatic reusable layouts out
of components, having full control of the rendered HTML without writing HTML in
templates. All this without breaking the standard way of doing things in Django,
so it plays nice with any other form application.

The application mainly provides:
- A filter named |crispy that will render elegant div based forms. Think of it
  as the built-in methods: as_table, as_ul and as_p. You cannot tune up the
  output, but it is easy to start using it.
- A tag named {% crispy %} that will render a form based on your configuration
  and specific layout setup. This gives you amazing power without much hassle,
  helping you save tons of time.
