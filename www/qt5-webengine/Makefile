# $FreeBSD$

# QtWebEngine itself is a very thin layer of Qt code on top of a large part of
# Chromium (everything up to the content/ layer). As such, most of the work in
# this port revolves around taming Chromium and getting it to build on FreeBSD.
# While it does build at the moment, there are several items that should be
# investigated or improved:
# - We are using several stub files, especially in Chromium's base/ and net/
#   layers. We should look at implementing the missing bits instead.
# - We are currently not using any sandboxing mechanism.
# - We are disabling support for features such as WebRTC and printing. We need
#   to see what it would take to properly support them.
# - We need to see if more "use_system_<FOO>" flags can be passed.
# - The process of porting QtWebEngine needs to be documented so we can move to
#   newer releases more easily.
