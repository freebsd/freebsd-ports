MySQL Squid Access Report, mysar for short, is a reporting system
for user web traffic activity, as logged from a squid proxy.

MySAR consists of two parts:

    * Command line utilities which import a squid log file in a
      MySQL database and maintain the databas.
    * A web interface for accessing the reports.
