Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and
httptools.

Until recently Python has lacked a minimal low-level server/application
interface for asyncio frameworks. The ASGI specification fills this gap, and
means we're now able to start building a common set of tooling usable across all
asyncio frameworks.

Uvicorn currently supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets. Support for HTTP/2 is
planned.
