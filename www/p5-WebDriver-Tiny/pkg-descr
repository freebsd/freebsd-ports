This is an interface module to the Selenium 2.0 spec, which automates browser
input.

Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely
up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing
purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based
administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.
