       This class is the parent for all access method supported
       by the WWW::Search library.  This library implements a
       Perl API to web-based search engines.

       Current search engines supported include AltaVista (both
       web and news), Dejanews, Excite (web only), HotBot (web
       only), Infoseek (e-mail, web, and news) and Lycos.

       Search results are limited and there is a pause between
       each request for results to avoid overloading either the
       client or the server.
