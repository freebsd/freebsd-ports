Rack::Timeout is middleware, which aborts requests that have been running for
longer than a specified timeout.

Rack::Timeout is not a solution to the problem of long-running requests, it is a
debug and remediation tool.  Developers should track rack-timeout's data and
address recurring instances of particular timeouts, for example, by refactoring
code so it runs faster or offsetting lengthy work to happen asynchronously.
