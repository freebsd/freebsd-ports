[simple | small | shell] web server

sws was born out of a project requirement for a small universal Web server
that could run on any POSIX platform to serve static content. Since it is
written in /bin/sh it should run on any BSD/GNU-Linux/Unix system. It has
been tested on FreeBSD, Solaris, and Debian GNU/Linux. Installation consists
of putting the program somewhere, making it executable, creating the
document directory, and creating an entry in inetd.conf. sws requires
/bin/sh, dirname, cat, and date to function. These should be found on any
modern POSIX system.
