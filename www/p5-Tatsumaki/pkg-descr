Tatsumaki is a toy port of Tornado for Perl using Plack (with
non-blocking extensions) and AnyEvent.

It allows you to write a web application that does a immediate
response with template rendering, IO-bound delayed response (like
fetching third party API or XML feeds), server push streaming and
long-poll Comet in a clean unified API.
