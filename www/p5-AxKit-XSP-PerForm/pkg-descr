PerForm is a large and complex taglib for AxKit XSP that facilitates
creating large and complex HTML, WML, or other types of data-entry
forms. PerForm tends to make life easier for you if your form data
is coming from different data sources, such as DBI, or even XML.

PerForm works as an XSP taglib, meaning you simply add some custom
XML tags to your XSP page, and PerForm does the rest. Well, almost...
PerForm works mainly by callbacks
