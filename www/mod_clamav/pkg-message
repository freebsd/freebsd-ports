# First you have to make sure, clamav runs in Daemon-Mode:
# Add "ClamavMode daemon" to your httpd.conf
# If clamd run on a local socket, it must have the same userid as the  
# webserver add something like "user www" to your clamav.conf
# If you don't want to start clamd as the same user as the Webserver
# you have to start clamd on an inet socket by removing LocalSocket...
# and add the options "TCPSocket ..." and "TCPAddr..."
# later in the clamav.conf
