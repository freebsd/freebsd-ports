  message: <<EOM
When upgrading from Gitea 1.7 or earlier, Gitea requires the addition of
another secret to the config file in order to start up.  Either manually add
JWT_SECRET to the ${PREFIX}/etc/gitea/conf/app.ini config file (see
app.ini.sample), or allow Gitea to make the change for you by making the
config file writable to the git user.

  message: <<EOM
We remind users that a bug was discovered with gitea dump in 1.14.3-1.14.6
and 1.15.0.  Database dumps from these versions cause broken fields in the
repo_unit and login_source tables causing the issue identified in #16961.
Users on 1.14.x must upgrade to 1.14.7 before running gitea dump.  See the
release notes for more information.
