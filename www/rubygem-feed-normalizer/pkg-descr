Feed normalizer wraps various RSS and Atom parsers, and returns
a single unified object graph, regardless of the underlying feed format.

Feed normalizer attempts to parse a given feed using all available
configured parsers.

Feed normalizer is useful when the representation of the data of
an underlying RSS/Atom feed should be the same regardless of the underlying
format and its terminology.
