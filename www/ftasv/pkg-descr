Apache's status module is an easy way to get information about what
your webserver is doing - at any time, except when you need that
information. Because this information is normally gathered via the
server-status page, it will be unavailable when the webserver is not responding.
The system administrator can restart the daemon and hope to get a glimpse of the
server-status page, a tiny clue about what is causing the trouble, before the
server gets overloaded again.

This project aims at helping the system administrator get his information
in crisis situations.
