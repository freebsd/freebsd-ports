This module allows you to record all HTTP communication between an
HTTP::Server::Simple-derived server and its clients.  It is a mixin, so
it doesn't itself subclass HTTP::Server::Simple; you need to subclass
from both HTTP::Server::Simple::Recorder and an actual
HTTP::Server::Simple subclass, and HTTP::Server::Simple::Recorder should
be listed first.
