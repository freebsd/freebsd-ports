The Static::Simple plugin is designed to make serving static content in
your application during development quick and easy, without requiring a
single line of code from you.

This plugin detects static files by looking at the file extension in
URL (such as .css or .png or .js). The plugin uses the lightweight
MIME::Types module to map file extensions to IANA-registered MIME
types, and will serve your static files with the correct MIME type
directly to the browser, without being processed through Catalyst.
