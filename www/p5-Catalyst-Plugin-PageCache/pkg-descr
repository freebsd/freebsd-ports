Many dynamic websites perform heavy processing on most pages, yet this
information may rarely change from request to request. Using the
PageCache plugin, you can cache the full output of different pages so
they are served to your visitors as fast as possible. This method of
caching is very useful for withstanding a Slashdotting, for example.

This plugin requires that you also load a Cache plugin. Please see the
Known Issues when choosing a cache backend.
