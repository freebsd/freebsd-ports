The majority of the web pages of the internet today are 
much larger than they need to be.  The reason for this is 
that HTML tends to be stored in a human readable format, with
indenting, newlines and comments.

However, all of these comments, whitespace etc. are ignored by
the browser, and needlessly lengthen download times.

Second, many people are using WYSIWYG HTML editors these days.
This makes creating content easy.  However these editors can
cause a number of compatibility problems by tying themselves to
a particular browser or operating system.

The HTML::Clean module encapsulates a number of HTML optimizations
and cleanups.  The end result is HTML that loads faster, displays
properly in more browsers.  Think of it as a compiler that
translates HTML input into optimized machine readable code.
