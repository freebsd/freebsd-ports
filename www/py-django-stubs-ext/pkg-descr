django-stubs contains type stubs and a custom mypy plugin to provide more
precise static types and type inference for Django framework. Django uses some
Python "magic" that makes having precise types for some code patterns
problematic. This is why we need this project. The final goal is to be able to
get precise types for most common patterns.
