This module provides an RPC::ExtDirect gateway implementation for Plack
environment. It is packaged as a standard Plack middleware component suitable
for using with Plack::Builder.

Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect is recommended to be used with Perl versions 5.12
and newer, for reasons explained below. For Perls older than 5.12,
CGI::ExtDirect gateway may be a better choice - especially if you cannot
install XS dependent packages.

If you are not familiar with Ext.Direct, more information can be found in
RPC::ExtDirect::Intro.
