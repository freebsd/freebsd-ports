Faraday 2.x compatible extraction of FaradayMiddleware::FollowRedirects. This
gem will also work with Faraday 1.x, to support gem codebases which can work
with Faraday 1.x or 2.x. For the former standard version of this middleware for
Faraday 1.x, check out https://github.com/lostisland/faraday_middleware. Faraday
1.x support is considered deprecated, please update to Faraday 2.x.
