Fuzzyurl provides two related functions: non-strict parsing of URLs or URL-like
strings into their component pieces (protocol, username, password, hostname,
port, path, query, and fragment), and fuzzy matching of URLs and URL patterns.

Specifically, URLs that look like this:
[protocol ://] [username [: password] @] [hostname] [: port] [/ path] [? query] [# fragment]

Fuzzyurls can be constructed using some or all of the above fields, optionally
replacing some or all of those fields with a * wildcard if you wish to use the
Fuzzyurl as a URL mask.
