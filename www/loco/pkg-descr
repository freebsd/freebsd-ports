Loco is "Rust on Rails".

Loco is strongly inspired by Rails. If you know Rails and Rust, you'll feel at
home. If you only know Rails and new to Rust, you'll find Loco refreshing.

Loco doesn't assume that the user know Rails.

In order to begin using Loco please type these commands:

$ loco new
> App name? [myapp]:
> Saas app (with DB and user auth)
  Stateless service (minimal, no db)
Loco app generated successfully in:
myapp
