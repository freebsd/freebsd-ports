Mod_Auth_External is an Apache module used for authentication. The Apache HTTP
Daemon can be configured to require users to supply logins and passwords
before accessing pages in some directories. Authentication is the process of
checking if the password given is correct for a user. Apache has standard
modules for authenticating out of several different kinds of databases.
Mod_Auth_External is a flexible tool for creating authentication systems based
on other databases.
