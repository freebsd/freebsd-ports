High-Performance Connectivity Tracer (HiPerConTracer) is a Ping/Traceroute
measurement framework. HiPerConTracer denotes the actual measurement
tool. It performs regular Ping and Traceroute runs among sites, featuring:
multi-transport-protocol support (ICMP, UDP); multi-homing and parallelism
support; handling of load balancing in the network; multi-platform
support (currently Linux and FreeBSD); high-precision (nanoseconds)
timing support (Linux timestamping, both software and hardware); a
library (shared/static) to integrate measurement functionality into other
software (libhipercontracer); open source and written in a performance-
and portability-focused programming language (C++) with only limited
dependencies.

Furthermore, the HiPerConTracer Framework furthermore provides additional
tools for helping to obtain, process, collect, store, and retrieve
measurement data: HiPerConTracer Viewer Tool for displaying the contents
of results files; Results Tool for merging and converting results files,
e.g. to create a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file; Sync Tool for copying data
from a measurement node (vantage point) to a remote HiPerConTracer Collector
server (via RSync/SSH); Reverse Tunnel Tool for maintaining a reverse SSH
tunnel from a remote measurement node to a HiPerConTracer Collector server;
Collector/Node Tools for simplifying the setup of HiPerConTracer Nodes and a
HiPerConTracer Collector server; Trigger Tool for triggering HiPerConTracer
measurements in the reverse direction; Importer Tool for storing measurement
data from results files into SQL or NoSQL databases. Currently, database
backends for MariaDB/MySQL PostgreSQL, MongoDB) are provided; Query
Tool for querying data from a database and storing it into a results
file; Database Shell as simple command-line front-end for the underlying
database backends; Database Tools with some helper scripts to e.g. to join
HiPerConTracer database configurations into an existing DBeaver (a popular
SQL database GUI application) configuration; UDP Echo Server as UDP Echo
(RFC 862) protocol endpoint; Wireshark dissector for HiPerConTracer packets.
