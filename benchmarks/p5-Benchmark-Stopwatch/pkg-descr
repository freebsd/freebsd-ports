The other benchmark modules provide excellent timing for specific
parts of your code. This module aims to allow you to easily time the
progression of your code.

The stopwatch analogy is that at some point you get a new stopwatch
and start timing. Then you note certain events using lap. Finally you
stop the watch and then print out a summary.

The summary shows all the events in order, what time they occurred at,
how long since the last lap and the percentage of the total time.
Hopefully this will give you a good idea of where your code is
spending most of its time.

The times are all wallclock times in fractional seconds.

That's it.
