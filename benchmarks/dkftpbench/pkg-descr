dkftpbench is an FTP benchmark program inspired by SPECweb99. The result of the
benchmark is a number-of-simultaneous-users rating; after running the benchmark 
properly, you have a good idea how many simultaneous dialup clients a server 
can support. The target bandwidth per client is set at 28.8 kilobits/second to 
model dialup users; this is important for servers on the real Internet, which 
often serve thousands of clients on only 10 MBits/sec of bandwidth.
