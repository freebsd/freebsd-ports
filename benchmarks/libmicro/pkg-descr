LibMicro is a portable set of microbenchmarks that many Solaris engineers
used during Solaris 10 development to measure the performance of various
system and library calls. LibMicro was developed by Bart Smaalders and
Phil Harman as part of their If another OS is faster it's a Solaris bug
performance campaign.
