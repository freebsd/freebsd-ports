LibMicro is a portable set of microbenchmarks that many Solaris engineers used
during Solaris 10 development to measure the performance of various system and
library calls. LibMicro was developed by Bart Smaalders and Phil Harman as part
of their If another OS is faster it's a Solaris bug performance campaign.
LibMicro is being released as Open Source under the CDDL license.
