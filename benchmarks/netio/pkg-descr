This is a network benchmark for DOS, OS/2 2.x, Windows NT/2000 and Unix.
It measures the net throughput of a network via NetBIOS and/or TCP/IP
protocols (Unix and DOS only support TCP/IP) using various different
packet sizes.

One instance has to run on one machine as a server process, another
instance is used on another machine to perform the benchmark. When
executed without arguments, the program will explain its usage.
