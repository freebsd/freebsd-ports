NetPerfMeter is a network performance meter for the TCP, MPTCP, SCTP, UDP,
DCCP, and QUIC transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6. It simultaneously
transmits bidirectional flows to an endpoint and measures the resulting flow
bandwidths and QoS. Flows can be saturated (i.e. "send as much as possible"
or non-saturated with frame rate and frame sizes (like a multimedia
transmission). Non-saturated flows can be configured with constant or
variable frame rate/frame size, i.e. to realise Constant Bit Rate (CBR) or
Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic. For both, frame rate and frame size, it is
not only possible to set constant values but to also to use random
distributions. Furthermore, flows can be set up as on/off flows. Of course,
the flow parameters can be configured individually per flow and flow
direction. The measurement results can be recorded as scalar files (summary
of the run) and vector files (time series). These files can be processed
further, e.g. for detailed analysis and plotting of the results. The
Wireshark network protocol analyser provides out-of-the-box support for
analysing NetPerfMeter packet traffic.
