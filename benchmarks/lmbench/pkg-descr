This is lmbench-3.0-a9, a (sometimes controversial) system performance
measurement tool.  lmbench is a suite of simple, portable, ANSI/C
microbenchmarks for UNIX/POSIX. In general, it measures two key features:
latency and bandwidth. lmbench is intended to give system developers insight
into basic costs of key operations. You can go to /usr/local/lib/lmbench and
do one of the following:

make results (to run the benchmarks)
make rerun   (to rerun the benchmarks)
make see     (to see how you did)
