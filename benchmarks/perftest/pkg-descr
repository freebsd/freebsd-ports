This is a collection of tests written over uverbs intended for use as a
performance micro-benchmark. The tests may be used for HW or SW tuning
as well as for functional testing.

The collection contains a set of bandwidth and latency benchmark such as:

	* Send        - ib_send_bw and ib_send_lat
	* RDMA Read   - ib_read_bw and ib_read_lat
	* RDMA Write  - ib_write_bw and ib_wriet_lat
	* RDMA Atomic - ib_atomic_bw and ib_atomic_lat
	* Native Ethernet (when working with MOFED2) - 
                        raw_ethernet_bw, raw_ethernet_lat
