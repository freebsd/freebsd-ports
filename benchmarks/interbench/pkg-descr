This benchmark application is designed to benchmark interactivity in Unix,
originally written by Con Kolivas et al. for Linux.

It is designed to measure the effect of changes in operating system kernel
design or system configuration changes such as CPU, I/O scheduler and file
system changes and options.  With careful benchmarking, different hardware
can be compared.
