Typometer is a tool to measure and analyze visual latency of text/code
editors.  Its features:

  - Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Unix)
  - Native API calls for faster screen access
  - Synchronous and asynchronous modes
  - Import and export of CSV data
  - Summary statistics, frequency distribution
  - Line/bar charts (including comparative ones)
  - Chart image export (with legend)

Editor latency is delay between an input event and a corresponding screen
update, in particular -- delay between keystroke and character appearance.
While there are many kinds of delays (caret movement, line editing, etc.),
typing latency is a major predictor of editor usability.

Java 8 or latter is required to run the program.
