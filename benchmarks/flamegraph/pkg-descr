a stack-trace visualizer

Flame Graphs visualize profiled code. Flame graphs can be created in three
steps: 1) Capture stacks, 2) Fold stacks, 3) flamegraph.pl.
Capturing stacks can be done with Linux perf_events, FreeBSD pmcstat (hwpmc),
DTrace, SystemTap, and many other profilers. See stackcollapse-*
converters. These stackcollapse scripts are used to fold the stacks.
Flamegraph SVGs are created using the flamegraph.pl script.
