Pathrate is a tool that can estimate the capacity of network paths. An
important feature of Pathrate is that it is robust to cross traffic effects,
meaning that it can measure the path capacity even when the path is
significantly loaded. This is crucial, since the hardest paths to measure are
the heavily loaded ones.
