pathChirp is a new active probing tool for estimating the available bandwidth
on a communication network path. Based on the concept of "self-induced
congestion", pathChirp features an exponential flight pattern of probes we
call a chirp. Packet chirps offer several significant advantages over current
probing schemes based on packet pairs or packet trains. By rapidly increasing
the probing rate within each chirp, pathChirp obtains a rich set of
information from which to dynamically estimate the available bandwidth.
