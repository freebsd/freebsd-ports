Geekbench is a cross-platform benchmark suite for Mac OS X, Windows,
Solaris, and Linux. Geekbench is designed to measure the performance
an average application can expect from both the processor and the
memory subsystem.

Geekbench's benchmarks are written in platform-neutral C++, and have
no platform-specific optimizations. Geekbench is compiled with what we
consider the de-facto standard compiler for each platform, with the
compiler switches suggested by the compiler vendor for release code.
