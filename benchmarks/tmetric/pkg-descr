Tmetric is a (still raw) tool to aid in determining the available bandwidth 
from one host to another. It is inspired by the (closed source) pathchar 
utility. Please do not assume that this program works exactly like pathchar 
does. It only attempts to report the bandwidth between 2 hosts, and not the 
bandwidth available at every hop on a route along the way.

I've only tried compiling this on FreeBSD and Linux. There is some strange 
behavior if your system has an outdated or limited FPU. My (oldassed) sparc 
(this web server), for example, doesn't handle the floating point precision 
types correctly for my tests. Oh well.
