ReFrame is a powerful Python framework for writing portable HPC regression
tests and benchmarks. It abstracts away system- and scheduler-specific
details so the test logic stays portable, while ReFrame handles modules/
env switching, compile, submit, polling, sanity/perf checks, and results
storage. CLI tool installed as `reframe`.
