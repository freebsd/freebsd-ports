The BYTE benchmark suite tests several aspects of system performance.

An article, which describes the concepts and helps understand the results 
can be found in the doc directory (/usr/local/lib/bytebench/doc if you use 
a PREFIX of /usr/local).

This benchmark is quite prominent among Linux users, and there is a patched 
version available from some web suite, from where results are made available, 
too.

Since they offer some results of non-Linux systems for comparison, they might 
be interested in FreeBSD reports, too ;-)


Quoting from "README.submittal" of the Linux version of this benchmark suite:

% Please e-mail test results along with platform info to:
