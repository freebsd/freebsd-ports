Web Polygraph is a benchmarking tool for Web proxies. Polygraph
distribution includes a high-performance client and server simulators.
The simulators create a stream of HTTP requests that can be routed through
a Web proxy. Studying proxy performance under various [stress] conditions is
essential for performance tuning, evaluation of new algorithms, analysis of
hardware configurations, and comparing available proxy products.
