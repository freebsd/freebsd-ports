IOR is a parallel IO benchmark that can be used to test the performance of
parallel storage systems using various interfaces and access patterns. The IOR
repository also includes the mdtest benchmark which specifically tests the peak
metadata rates of storage systems under different directory structures. Both
benchmarks use a common parallel I/O abstraction backend and rely on MPI for
synchronization.
