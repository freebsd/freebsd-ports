Filebench is quick to set up and use unlike many of the commercial
benchmarks which it can emulate. It is also a handy tool for
micro-benchmarking storage subsystems and studying the relationships of
complex applications such as relational databases with their storage
without having to incur the costs of setting up those applications,
loading data and so forth.

Filebench uses loadable workload personalities in a common framework to
allow easy emulation of complex applications upon file systems. The
workload personalities use a Workload Definition Language to define the
workload's model.
