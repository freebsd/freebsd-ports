SPP provides frequently updated RTT estimates using IP traffic already
present in the network. SPP estimates the RTT between two measurement
points without requiring precise time synchronisation between each
point. SPP accurately estimates the RTT experienced by any application's
traffic without needing modifications to the application itself
or the routers along the path.
