Extreme performance and stability test for PC hardware: video card,
power supply, cooling system.  Check your rig in stock and overclocked
modes with real-life load!  Also includes interactive experience.

The benchmark depicts a Gothic chapel with sorrowful statues stand in
solemn stillness lit by the trembling light of torches.  Only few rays
of sun coming through the stained glass windows slide over the biblical
fresco and ominous creatures carved in cold stone.

The very first GPU benchmark from UNIGINE, the original version was
released in 2007, the 2.3 update was out in 2010.

  - Support of DirectX 9, DirectX 10, and OpenGL
  - Five dynamic lights, HDR rendering

The program requires linprocfs(5) and linsysfs(5) to be mounted under
/compat/linux/{proc,sys} to operate and writable /compat/linux/dev/shm
directory, which is typically backed by tmpfs(5).
