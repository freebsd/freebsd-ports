Yggdrasil is a new experimental compact routing scheme. It is designed to be a
future-proof and decentralised alternative to the structured routing protocols
commonly used today on the Internet, as well as an enabling technology for
future large-scale mesh networks.

The current implementation of Yggdrasil is a lightweight userspace software
router which is easy to configure and supported on a wide range of platforms. It
provides end-to-end encrypted IPv6 routing between all network
participants. Peerings between nodes can be configured using TCP/TLS connections
over local area networks, point-to-point links or the Internet. Even though the
Yggdrasil Network provides IPv6 routing between nodes, peering connections can
be set up over either IPv4 or IPv6 networks.

This is still an alpha-stage project and there may be some breaking changes in
the future. Despite that, Yggdrasil is generally stable enough for day-to-day
use and a small number of users have been using and stress-testing Yggdrasil
quite heavily for a variety of use cases.
