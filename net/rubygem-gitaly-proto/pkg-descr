Gitaly is part of GitLab. It is a server application that uses its own gRPC
protocol to communicate with its clients. This repository contains the protocol
definition and automatically generated wrapper code for Go and Ruby.

The .proto files define the remote procedure calls for interacting with Gitaly.
We keep auto-generated client libraries for Ruby and Go in their respective
subdirectories.

Use the make generate script from the root of the repository to regenerate the
client libraries after updating .proto files.
