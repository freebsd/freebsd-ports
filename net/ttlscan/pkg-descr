ttlscan is a libnet/libpcap based program that sends a TCP SYN packet to 
each port of the host given via the command line. The answer is sniffed 
of the wire. I use it to detect hosts that fake services by forwarding 
packets to another host (behind a firewall). By reading header files 
like the TTL, window size and IPID you might be able to see the OS 
running on the host behind the firewall.
