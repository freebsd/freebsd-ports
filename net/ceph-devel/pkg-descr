Ceph is a distributed object store and file system designed to provide
excellent performance, reliability and scalability.

* Object Storage
  Ceph provides seamless access to objects using native language bindings or 
  radosgw, a REST interface for applications written with S3 and Swift.
* Block Storage
  Ceph's RADOS Block Device (RBD) provides access to block device images
  that are striped and replicated across the entire storage cluster.
* File System
  Ceph provides a POSIX-compliant network file system aiming for large data
  storage, high performance, and maximum compatibility with legacy applications.

This FreeBSD build will build most of the tools in Ceph:
* Mon, OSD, rados, RadosGW, rbd
* init-ceph, and etc/rc.d/ceph on top of that
* ceph-disk {prepare, activate}
With these tools one can build a multi server, multi osd cluster fully 
running on FreeBSD and do some testing...
