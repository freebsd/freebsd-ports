XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the Internet.
It converts the procedure call into XML document, sends it to a remote
server using HTTP, and gets back the response as XML.

This library provides a modular implementation of XML-RPC for C and C++.

   - C API and experimental C++ API.
   - Modular XML-RPC core: If you want, you can supply all your own HTTP
     code.
   - Synchronous and asynchronous XML-RPC clients based on w3c-libwww.
   - Multithreaded XML-RPC server based on the Abyss web server.
   - Full support for basic types, including <struct>, <array> and <base64>.
   - Extensive test suites to help verify correct behavior and correct
     error handling.
   - Passes the official XML-RPC validator1 test suite.
