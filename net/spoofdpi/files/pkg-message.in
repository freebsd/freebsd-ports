You can use ${PORTNAME} rc.d service and specify arguments for ${PORTNAME} program in rc.conf file like this below or you can use the configuration file located in '%%ETCDIR%%':
To enable/start ${PORTNAME} service:

A new feature (-fake-https-packets) has been added that adds up a dependency on ${PORTNAME}: libpcap. This feature requires the daemon to be run as root if it is enabled with an argument, it will fail with the default '${PORTNAME}' user, to be able to use it, switch the daemon user to root.
	# sysrc ${PORTNAME}_user="root"

${PORTNAME} now supports configuration files written in TOML, installed in ${ETCDIR} directory with a sample config file.
Options given through the command-line flags (via rc.conf or as user) will override the options set by the config file.
You can edit the config via being as root or adding your user to the ${PORTNAME} group (default group).
Config locations are: $SPOOFDPI_CONFIG environment variable, ${ETCDIR}/${PORTNAME}.toml, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/${PORTNAME}/${PORTNAME}.toml and $HOME/.config/${PORTNAME}/${PORTNAME}.toml
