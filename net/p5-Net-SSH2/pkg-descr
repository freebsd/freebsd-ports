Net::SSH2 is a perl interface to the libssh2 (http://www.libssh2.org) library.
It supports the SSH2 protocol (there is no support for SSH1) with all of the
key exchanges, ciphers, and compression of libssh2.

Unless otherwise indicated, methods return a true value on success and false
on failure; use the error method to get extended error information.

The typical order is to create the SSH2 object, set up the connection methods
you want to use, call connect, authenticate with one of the auth methods, then
create channels on the connection to perform commands.
