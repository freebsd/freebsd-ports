Jags is a Gtk+ based windows network neighbourhood browser. The
program parses the output from smbclient ( part of the samba-package
) and use this to display a graphic view of the network. This
program does the parsing with help from shell- scripts. This means
that it's easy to change the functionality of the program and you
can edit this without touching the source-code.
