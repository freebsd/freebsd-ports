nss-pam-ldapd, a Name Service Switch (NSS) module and Pluggable Authentication 
Module (PAM) that allows your LDAP server to provide user account, group, host 
name, alias, netgroup, and basically any other information that you would 
normally get from /etc flat files or NIS. It also alows you to do 
authentication to an LDAP server. 

Key differences from nss_ldap:
* lighter NSS library
* lighter PAM library
* simpler internal semantics
* clear separation between NSS, PAM and LDAP code (the server part could easily be implemented in another language)
* less connections to the LDAP server
