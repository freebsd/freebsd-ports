This module provides a simple functional "named parameters" style interface
for creating URIs. Underneath the hood it uses URI.pm, though because of
the simplified interface it may not support all possible options for all
types of URIs.

It was created for the common case where you simply want to have a simple
interface for creating syntactically correct URIs from known components
(like a path and query string). Doing this using the native URI.pm
interface is rather tedious, requiring a number of method calls, which is
particularly ugly when done inside a templating system such as Mason or
TT2.
