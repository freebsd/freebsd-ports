Liferea is a simple FeedReader clone. It is a reader for RSS/RDF
feeds. The problem with FeedReader: for now its only available for
Windows. There are some projects for GNU/Linux or Unices, but no
satisfying solutions for GTK/GNOME. Therefore I started to write
this program. Liferea is an abbreviation for Linux Feed Reader.
