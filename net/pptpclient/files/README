Quickstart for the PPTP client.

Set up your /etc/ppp/ppp.conf based on the example in this directory.
Make these substitutions:

    SERVER	IP address of the PPTP server

    LABEL	PPP label to use (must be the same on the command
		line and in the ppp.conf file)

    USER	Your account name on the server

    PASSWORD	Your password on the server

    Change the "add" commands in ppp.conf to set up the routing
    appropriately.

Note: your PPP program must be new enough to support MS-CHAP
authentication.

You must run the program as root.  Use a command like this:

    pptp SERVER LABEL

Kill it with ^C when you're done.

If you want to access the remote system from other hosts on your LAN,
be sure to turn on IP forwarding on the PPTP client machine.

Starting as a service:

	# Configure /etc/ppp/ppp.conf as described above
	$ sysrc pptp_enable=YES
	$ sysrc pptp_flags="SERVER [LABEL]"
	$ service pptp start

NB: LABEL can be omitted if you used "default" for LABEL in ppp.conf(5).
