The guacamole-server package is a set of software which forms the
basis of the Guacamole stack. It consists of guacd, libguac, and
several protocol support libraries.

guacd is the Guacamole proxy daemon used by the Guacamole web
application and framework. As JavaScript cannot handle binary
protocols (like VNC and remote desktop) efficiently, a new test-based
protocol was developed which would contain a common superset of the
operations needed for efficient remote desktop access, but would
be easy for JavaScript programs to process. guacd is the proxy which
translates between arbitrary protocols and the Guacamole protocol.
