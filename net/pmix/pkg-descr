OpenPMIx is an open source, non-copy-left licensed, and independent (i.e., not
affiliated with any specific programming model code base) standalone library
that supports application interactions with Resource Managers (RMs). It retains
transparent compatibility with existing PMI-1 and PMI-2 definitions, and any
future PMI releases.

OpenPMIx also supports the Instant On initiative for rapid startup of
applications at exascale and beyond, and works with the HPC community to define
and implement new APIs that support evolving programming model requirements for
application-RM interactions.
