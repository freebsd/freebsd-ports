FreeBSD specific information
============================

* Your configuration is in: %%SAMBA4_CONFDIR%%/%%SAMBA4_CONFIG%%

* All the logs are under: %%SAMBA4_LOGDIR%%

* All the relevant databases are under: %%SAMBA4_LOCKDIR%%

* Provisioning script is: %%PREFIX%%/bin/samba-tool

Samba4 provisioning requires file system(s) with the ACLs support. On
UFS2 you need to enable POSIX ACLs by adding 'acls' option to the mount
flags, on ZFS you need to use NFSv4 ACLs and `zfsacl` VFS module to get
provisioning work.

There is a hack in the code, that makes provisioning work on UFS2 and in
the jails on the price of using USER extattr(2) namespace, which is less
secure than SYSTEM namespace, as can be edited not only by root user, but
also by the owner of the file.

For the provisioning on ZFS you need to use additional parameters to the
samba-tool, that would explicitly add `zfsacl` to the default `vfs objects`:

    # samba-tool domain provision --interactive \
            --option="vfs objects"="dfs_samba4 zfsacl"

To run this port you need to perform the following steps:
---------------------------------------------------------

0. If you had Samba3 port installed before, please, *take backups* of
all the relevant files. That includes 'smb.conf' file and all the
content of the '/var/db/samba/' directory.

1a. Create new '%%SAMBA4_CONFDIR%%/%%SAMBA4_CONFIG%%' file by running:

    # samba-tool domain provision

1b. Or upgrade from the Samba3 'smb.conf' file by running:

    # samba-tool domain classicupgrade

%%AC_DC%%1c. You will need to specify location of the 'nsupdate' command in the
%%AC_DC%%'%%SAMBA4_CONFIG%%' file:
%%AC_DC%%
%%AC_DC%%      nsupdate command = %%PREFIX%%/bin/samba-nsupdate -g
%%AC_DC%%
2. Put string 'samba_server_enable="YES"' into your /etc/rc.conf.

3. Make sure that your server doesn't run Samba3, OpenLDAP and named.
Stop them, if necessary.

4. Run '%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/samba_server start' or reboot.

Please, check archives of samba@lists.samba.org and ask there for help,
if necessary:

Port related bugs can be reported to the FreeBSD Bugzilla or directly to:

    https://gitlab.com/samba-freebsd/ports/-/issues

In case you found a bug which is clearly not related to the port build
process itself, plese file a bug report at:

    https://bugzilla.samba.org/

And add me to CC list.
