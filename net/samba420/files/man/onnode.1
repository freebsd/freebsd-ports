.SH "NAME"
onnode \- run commands on CTDB cluster nodes
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBonnode\fR\ 'u
\fBonnode\fR [\fIOPTION\fR...] {\fINODES\fR} {\fICOMMAND\fR}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
onnode is a utility to run commands on a specific node of a CTDB cluster, or on all nodes\&.
.PP
\fINODES\fR
specifies which node(s) to run a command on\&. See section
NODES SPECIFICATION
for details\&.
.PP
\fICOMMAND\fR
can be any shell command\&. The onnode utility uses ssh or rsh to connect to the remote nodes and run the command\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-c
.RS 4
Execute COMMAND in the current working directory on the specified nodes\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f \fIFILENAME\fR
.RS 4
Specify an alternative nodes FILENAME to use instead of the default\&. See the discussion of
/usr/local/etc/ctdb/nodes
in the FILES section for more details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i
.RS 4
Keep standard input open, allowing data to be piped to onnode\&. Normally onnode closes stdin to avoid surprises when scripting\&. Note that this option is ignored when using
\fB\-p\fR
or if
\fBONNODE_SSH\fR
is set to anything other than "ssh"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n
.RS 4
Allow nodes to be specified by name rather than node numbers\&. These nodes don\*(Aqt need to be listed in the nodes file\&. You can avoid the nodes file entirely by combining this with
\-f /dev/null\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p
.RS 4
Run COMMAND in parallel on the specified nodes\&. The default is to run COMMAND sequentially on each node\&.
.RE
.PP
\-P
.RS 4
Push files to nodes\&. Names of files to push are specified rather than the usual command\&. Quoting is fragile/broken \- filenames with whitespace in them are not supported\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
Do not print node addresses\&. Normally, onnode prints informational node addresses if more than one node is specified\&. This overrides \-v\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
Print node addresses even if only one node is specified\&. Normally, onnode prints informational node addresses when more than one node is specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h, \-\-help
.RS 4
Show a short usage guide\&.
.RE
.SH "NODES SPECIFICATION"
.PP
Nodes can be specified via numeric node numbers (from 0 to N\-1) or mnemonics\&. Multiple nodes are specified using lists of nodes, separated by commas, and ranges of numeric node numbers, separated by dashes\&. If nodes are specified multiple times then the command will be executed multiple times on those nodes\&. The order of nodes is significant\&.
.PP
The following mnemonics are available:
.PP
all
.RS 4
All nodes\&.
.RE
.PP
any
.RS 4
A node where ctdbd is running\&. This semi\-random but there is a bias towards choosing a low numbered node\&.
.RE
.PP
ok | healthy
.RS 4
All nodes that are not disconnected, banned, disabled or unhealthy\&.
.RE
.PP
con | connected
.RS 4
All nodes that are not disconnected\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The following command would show the process ID of ctdbd on all nodes
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
      onnode all ctdb getpid
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The following command would show the last 5 lines of log on each node, preceded by the node\*(Aqs hostname
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
      onnode all "hostname; tail \-5 /var/log/log\&.ctdb"
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The following command would restart the ctdb service on all nodes, in parallel\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
      onnode \-p all service ctdb restart
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The following command would run \&./foo in the current working directory, in parallel, on nodes 0, 2, 3 and 4\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
      onnode \-c \-p 0,2\-4 \&./foo
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "FILES"
.PP
/usr/local/etc/ctdb/nodes
.RS 4
Default file containing a list of each node\*(Aqs IP address or hostname\&.
.sp
As above, a file specified via the
\fB\-f\fR
is given precedence\&. If a relative path is specified and no corresponding file exists relative to the current directory then the file is also searched for in the CTDB configuration directory\&.
.sp
Otherwise the default is
/usr/local/etc/ctdb/nodes\&.
.RE
.PP
/usr/local/etc/ctdb/onnode\&.conf
.RS 4
If this file exists it is sourced by onnode\&. The main purpose is to allow the administrator to set
\fBONNODE_SSH\fR
to something other than "ssh"\&. In this case the \-t option is ignored\&.
