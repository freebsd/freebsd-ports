.SH "NAME"
tdbbackup \- tool for backing up and for validating the integrity of samba \&.tdb files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBtdbbackup\fR\ 'u
\fBtdbbackup\fR [\-s\ suffix] [\-v] [\-h] [\-l]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(1)
suite\&.
.PP
\fBtdbbackup\fR
is a tool that may be used to backup samba \&.tdb files\&. This tool may also be used to verify the integrity of the \&.tdb files prior to samba startup or during normal operation\&. If it finds file damage and it finds a prior backup the backup file will be restored\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Get help information\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s suffix
.RS 4
The
\fB\-s\fR
option allows the administrator to specify a file backup extension\&. This way it is possible to keep a history of tdb backup files by using a new suffix for each backup\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
The
\fB\-v\fR
will check the database for damages (corrupt data) which if detected causes the backup to be restored\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l
.RS 4
This options disables any locking, by passing TDB_NOLOCK to tdb_open_ex()\&. Only use this for database files which are not used by any other process! And also only if it is otherwise not possible to open the database, e\&.g\&. databases which were created with mutex locking\&.
.RE
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
\fIGENERAL INFORMATION\fR
.PP
The
\fBtdbbackup\fR
utility can safely be run at any time\&. It was designed so that it can be used at any time to validate the integrity of tdb files, even during Samba operation\&. Typical usage for the command will be:
.PP
tdbbackup [\-s suffix] *\&.tdb
.PP
Before restarting samba the following command may be run to validate \&.tdb files:
.PP
tdbbackup \-v [\-s suffix] *\&.tdb
.PP
Samba \&.tdb files are stored in various locations, be sure to run backup all \&.tdb file on the system\&. Important files includes:
.sp

.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

\fBsecrets\&.tdb\fR
\- usual location is in the /usr/local/samba/private directory, or on some systems in /etc/samba\&.
