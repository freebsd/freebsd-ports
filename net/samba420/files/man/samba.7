.SH "COMPONENTS"
.PP
The Samba suite is made up of several components\&. Each component is described in a separate manual page\&. It is strongly recommended that you read the documentation that comes with Samba and the manual pages of those components that you use\&. If the manual pages and documents aren\*(Aqt clear enough then please visit
https://devel\&.samba\&.org
for information on how to file a bug report or submit a patch\&.
.PP
If you require help, visit the Samba webpage at
https://www\&.samba\&.org/
and explore the many option available to you\&.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.PP

The Samba Wiki at
https://wiki\&.samba\&.org
has also a lot of useful information\&. On the Samba mailing list at
https://lists\&.samba\&.org
you can find a lot of information in the archives and you can subscribe to the samba list and ask for help or discuss things\&.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is part of version 4\&.16\&.4 of the Samba suite\&.

for information on how to do it properly\&. We prefer patches in
git format\-patch
format\&.
.SH "CONTRIBUTORS"
.PP
Contributors to the project are now too numerous to mention here but all deserve the thanks of all Samba users\&. To see a full list, look at the
change\-log
in the source package for the pre\-CVS changes and at
https://git\&.samba\&.org/
for the contributors to Samba post\-GIT\&. GIT is the Open Source source code control system used by the Samba Team to develop Samba\&. The project would have been unmanageable without it\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell\&. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed\&.
