.SH "NAME"
smb.conf \- The configuration file for the Samba suite
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
The
smb\&.conf
file is a configuration file for the Samba suite\&.
smb\&.conf
contains runtime configuration information for the Samba programs\&. The complete description of the file format and possible parameters held within are here for reference purposes\&.
.SH "HOW CONFIGURATION CHANGES ARE APPLIED"
.PP
The Samba suite includes a number of different programs\&. Some of them operate in a client mode, others are server daemons that provide various services to its clients\&. The
smb\&.conf
file is processed in the following way:
.RS
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The Samba suite\*(Aqs client applications read their configuration only once\&. Any changes made after start aren\*(Aqt reflected in the context of already running client code\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The Samba suite\*(Aqs server daemons reload their configuration when requested\&. However, already active connections do not change their configuration\&. More detailed information can be found in
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
and
\fBwinbindd\fR(8)
manual pages\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
To request Samba server daemons to refresh their configuration, please use
\fBsmbcontrol\fR(1)
utility\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The file consists of sections and parameters\&. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins\&. Sections contain parameters of the form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fIname\fR = \fIvalue \fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The file is line\-based \- that is, each newline\-terminated line represents either a comment, a section name or a parameter\&.
.PP
Section and parameter names are not case sensitive\&.
.PP
Only the first equals sign in a parameter is significant\&. Whitespace before or after the first equals sign is discarded\&. Leading, trailing and internal whitespace in section and parameter names is irrelevant\&. Leading and trailing whitespace in a parameter value is discarded\&. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is retained verbatim\&.
.PP
Any line beginning with a semicolon (\(lq;\(rq) or a hash (\(lq#\(rq) character is ignored, as are lines containing only whitespace\&.
.PP
Any line ending in a
\(lq\e\(rq
is continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion\&.
.PP
The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 1/0 or true/false\&. Case is not significant in boolean values, but is preserved in string values\&. Some items such as create masks are numeric\&.
.SH "SECTION DESCRIPTIONS"
.PP
Each section in the configuration file (except for the [global] section) describes a shared resource (known as a
\(lqshare\(rq)\&. The section name is the name of the shared resource and the parameters within the section define the shares attributes\&.
.PP
There are three special sections, [global], [homes] and [printers], which are described under
\fIspecial sections\fR\&. The following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions\&.
.PP
A share consists of a directory to which access is being given plus a description of the access rights which are granted to the user of the service\&. Some housekeeping options are also specifiable\&.
.PP
Sections are either file share services (used by the client as an extension of their native file systems) or printable services (used by the client to access print services on the host running the server)\&.
.PP
Sections may be designated
\fIguest\fR
services, in which case no password is required to access them\&. A specified UNIX
\fIguest account\fR
is used to define access privileges in this case\&.
.PP
Sections other than guest services will require a password to access them\&. The client provides the username\&. As older clients only provide passwords and not usernames, you may specify a list of usernames to check against the password using the
user =
option in the share definition\&. For modern clients such as Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000, this should not be necessary\&.
.PP
The access rights granted by the server are masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest UNIX user by the host system\&. The server does not grant more access than the host system grants\&.
.PP
The following sample section defines a file space share\&. The user has write access to the path
/home/bar\&. The share is accessed via the share name
foo:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
	\fI[foo]\fR
	\m[blue]\fBpath = /home/bar\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBread only = no\fR\m[]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The following sample section defines a printable share\&. The share is read\-only, but printable\&. That is, the only write access permitted is via calls to open, write to and close a spool file\&. The
\fIguest ok\fR
parameter means access will be permitted as the default guest user (specified elsewhere):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
	\fI[aprinter]\fR
	\m[blue]\fBpath = /var/tmp\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBread only = yes\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBprintable = yes\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBguest ok = yes\fR\m[]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "SPECIAL SECTIONS"
.SS "The [global] section"
.PP
Parameters in this section apply to the server as a whole, or are defaults for sections that do not specifically define certain items\&. See the notes under PARAMETERS for more information\&.
.SS "The [homes] section"
.PP
If a section called [homes] is included in the configuration file, services connecting clients to their home directories can be created on the fly by the server\&.
.PP
When the connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned\&. If a match is found, it is used\&. If no match is found, the requested section name is treated as a username and looked up in the local password file\&. If the name exists and the correct password has been given, a share is created by cloning the [homes] section\&.
.PP
Some modifications are then made to the newly created share:
.RS
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The share name is changed from homes to the located username\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If no path was given, the path is set to the user\*(Aqs home directory\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
If you decide to use a
\fIpath =\fR
line in your [homes] section, it may be useful to use the %S macro\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBpath = /data/pchome/%S\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
is useful if you have different home directories for your PCs than for UNIX access\&.
.PP
This is a fast and simple way to give a large number of clients access to their home directories with a minimum of fuss\&.
.PP
A similar process occurs if the requested section name is
\(lqhomes\(rq, except that the share name is not changed to that of the requesting user\&. This method of using the [homes] section works well if different users share a client PC\&.
.PP
The [homes] section can specify all the parameters a normal service section can specify, though some make more sense than others\&. The following is a typical and suitable [homes] section:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fI[homes]\fR
\m[blue]\fBread only = no\fR\m[]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
An important point is that if guest access is specified in the [homes] section, all home directories will be visible to all clients
\fIwithout a password\fR\&. In the very unlikely event that this is actually desirable, it is wise to also specify
\fIread only access\fR\&.
.PP
The
\fIbrowseable\fR
flag for auto home directories will be inherited from the global browseable flag, not the [homes] browseable flag\&. This is useful as it means setting
\fIbrowseable = no\fR
in the [homes] section will hide the [homes] share but make any auto home directories visible\&.
.SS "The [printers] section"
.PP
This section works like [homes], but for printers\&.
.PP
If a [printers] section occurs in the configuration file, users are able to connect to any printer specified in the local host\*(Aqs printcap file\&.
.PP
When a connection request is made, the existing sections are scanned\&. If a match is found, it is used\&. If no match is found, but a [homes] section exists, it is used as described above\&. Otherwise, the requested section name is treated as a printer name and the appropriate printcap file is scanned to see if the requested section name is a valid printer share name\&. If a match is found, a new printer share is created by cloning the [printers] section\&.
.PP
A few modifications are then made to the newly created share:
.RS
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
The share name is set to the located printer name
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If no printer name was given, the printer name is set to the located printer name
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
If the share does not permit guest access and no username was given, the username is set to the located printer name\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
The [printers] service MUST be printable \- if you specify otherwise, the server will refuse to load the configuration file\&.
.PP
Typically the path specified is that of a world\-writeable spool directory with the sticky bit set on it\&. A typical [printers] entry looks like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fI[printers]\fR
\m[blue]\fBpath = /var/tmp\fR\m[]
\m[blue]\fBguest ok = yes\fR\m[]
\m[blue]\fBprintable = yes\fR\m[]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
All aliases given for a printer in the printcap file are legitimate printer names as far as the server is concerned\&. If your printing subsystem doesn\*(Aqt work like that, you will have to set up a pseudo\-printcap\&. This is a file consisting of one or more lines like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
alias|alias|alias|alias\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Each alias should be an acceptable printer name for your printing subsystem\&. In the [global] section, specify the new file as your printcap\&. The server will only recognize names found in your pseudo\-printcap, which of course can contain whatever aliases you like\&. The same technique could be used simply to limit access to a subset of your local printers\&.
.PP
An alias, by the way, is defined as any component of the first entry of a printcap record\&. Records are separated by newlines, components (if there are more than one) are separated by vertical bar symbols (|)\&.
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
.PP
On SYSV systems which use lpstat to determine what printers are defined on the system you may be able to use
printcap name = lpstat
to automatically obtain a list of printers\&. See the
printcap name
option for more details\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.SH "USERSHARES"
.PP
Starting with Samba version 3\&.0\&.23 the capability for non\-root users to add, modify, and delete their own share definitions has been added\&. This capability is called
\fIusershares\fR
and is controlled by a set of parameters in the [global] section of the smb\&.conf\&. The relevant parameters are :
.PP
usershare allow guests
.RS 4
Controls if usershares can permit guest access\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare max shares
.RS 4
Maximum number of user defined shares allowed\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare owner only
.RS 4
If set only directories owned by the sharing user can be shared\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare path
.RS 4
Points to the directory containing the user defined share definitions\&. The filesystem permissions on this directory control who can create user defined shares\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare prefix allow list
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of absolute pathnames restricting what directories can be shared\&. Only directories below the pathnames in this list are permitted\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare prefix deny list
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of absolute pathnames restricting what directories can be shared\&. Directories below the pathnames in this list are prohibited\&.
.RE
.PP
usershare template share
.RS 4
Names a pre\-existing share used as a template for creating new usershares\&. All other share parameters not specified in the user defined share definition are copied from this named share\&.
.RE
.PP
To allow members of the UNIX group
foo
to create user defined shares, create the directory to contain the share definitions as follows:
.PP
Become root:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
mkdir /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
chgrp foo /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
chmod 1770 /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.PP
Then add the parameters
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
	\m[blue]\fBusershare path = /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares\fR\m[]
	\m[blue]\fBusershare max shares = 10\fR\m[] # (or the desired number of shares)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
to the global section of your
smb\&.conf\&. Members of the group foo may then manipulate the user defined shares using the following commands\&.
.PP
net usershare add sharename path [comment] [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]
.RS 4
To create or modify (overwrite) a user defined share\&.
.RE
.PP
net usershare delete sharename
.RS 4
To delete a user defined share\&.
.RE
.PP
net usershare list wildcard\-sharename
.RS 4
To list user defined shares\&.
.RE
.PP
net usershare info wildcard\-sharename
.RS 4
To print information about user defined shares\&.
.RE
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
Parameters define the specific attributes of sections\&.
.PP
Some parameters are specific to the [global] section (e\&.g\&.,
\fIsecurity\fR)\&. Some parameters are usable in all sections (e\&.g\&.,
\fIcreate mask\fR)\&. All others are permissible only in normal sections\&. For the purposes of the following descriptions the [homes] and [printers] sections will be considered normal\&. The letter
\fIG\fR
in parentheses indicates that a parameter is specific to the [global] section\&. The letter
\fIS\fR
indicates that a parameter can be specified in a service specific section\&. All
\fIS\fR
parameters can also be specified in the [global] section \- in which case they will define the default behavior for all services\&.
.PP
Parameters are arranged here in alphabetical order \- this may not create best bedfellows, but at least you can find them! Where there are synonyms, the preferred synonym is described, others refer to the preferred synonym\&.
.SH "VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS"
.PP
Many of the strings that are settable in the config file can take substitutions\&. For example the option
\(lqpath = /tmp/%u\(rq
is interpreted as
\(lqpath = /tmp/john\(rq
if the user connected with the username john\&.
.PP
These substitutions are mostly noted in the descriptions below, but there are some general substitutions which apply whenever they might be relevant\&. These are:
.PP
%U
.RS 4
session username (the username that the client wanted, not necessarily the same as the one they got)\&.
.RE
.PP
%G
.RS 4
primary group name of %U\&.
.RE
.PP
%h
.RS 4
the Internet hostname that Samba is running on\&.
.RE
.PP
%m
.RS 4
the NetBIOS name of the client machine (very useful)\&.
.sp
This parameter is not available when Samba listens on port 445, as clients no longer send this information\&. If you use this macro in an include statement on a domain that has a Samba domain controller be sure to set in the [global] section
\fIsmb ports = 139\fR\&. This will cause Samba to not listen on port 445 and will permit include functionality to function as it did with Samba 2\&.x\&.
.RE
.PP
%L
.RS 4
the NetBIOS name of the server\&. This allows you to change your config based on what the client calls you\&. Your server can have a

smb\&.conf
options\&.
.SH "NAME MANGLING"
.PP
Samba supports
name mangling
so that DOS and Windows clients can use files that don\*(Aqt conform to the 8\&.3 format\&. It can also be set to adjust the case of 8\&.3 format filenames\&.
.PP
There are several options that control the way mangling is performed, and they are grouped here rather than listed separately\&. For the defaults look at the output of the testparm program\&.
.PP
These options can be set separately for each service\&.
.PP
The options are:
.PP
case sensitive = yes/no/auto
.RS 4
controls whether filenames are case sensitive\&. If they aren\*(Aqt, Samba must do a filename search and match on passed names\&. The default setting of auto allows clients that support case sensitive filenames (Linux CIFSVFS and smbclient 3\&.0\&.5 and above currently) to tell the Samba server on a per\-packet basis that they wish to access the file system in a case\-sensitive manner (to support UNIX case sensitive semantics)\&. No Windows or DOS system supports case\-sensitive filename so setting this option to auto is that same as setting it to no for them\&. Default
\fIauto\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
default case = upper/lower
.RS 4
controls what the default case is for new filenames (ie\&. files that don\*(Aqt currently exist in the filesystem)\&. Default
\fIlower\fR\&. IMPORTANT NOTE: As part of the optimizations for directories containing large numbers of files, the following special case applies\&. If the options
\m[blue]\fBcase sensitive = yes\fR\m[],
\m[blue]\fBpreserve case = No\fR\m[], and
\m[blue]\fBshort preserve case = No\fR\m[]
are set, then the case of
\fIall\fR
incoming client filenames, not just new filenames, will be modified\&. See additional notes below\&.
.RE
.PP
preserve case = yes/no
.RS 4
controls whether new files (ie\&. files that don\*(Aqt currently exist in the filesystem) are created with the case that the client passes, or if they are forced to be the
default
case\&. Default
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
short preserve case = yes/no
.RS 4
controls if new files (ie\&. files that don\*(Aqt currently exist in the filesystem) which conform to 8\&.3 syntax, that is all in upper case and of suitable length, are created upper case, or if they are forced to be the
default
case\&. This option can be used with
preserve case = yes
to permit long filenames to retain their case, while short names are lowercased\&. Default
\fIyes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
By default, Samba 3\&.0 has the same semantics as a Windows NT server, in that it is case insensitive but case preserving\&. As a special case for directories with large numbers of files, if the case options are set as follows, "case sensitive = yes", "case preserve = no", "short preserve case = no" then the "default case" option will be applied and will modify all filenames sent from the client when accessing this share\&.
.SH "REGISTRY\-BASED CONFIGURATION"
.PP
Starting with Samba version 3\&.2\&.0, the capability to store Samba configuration in the registry is available\&. The configuration is stored in the registry key
\fIHKLM\eSoftware\eSamba\esmbconf\fR\&. There are two levels of registry configuration:
.RS
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
Share definitions stored in registry are used\&. This is triggered by setting the global parameter
\fIregistry shares\fR
to
\(lqyes\(rq
in
\fIsmb\&.conf\fR\&.
.sp
The registry shares are loaded not at startup but on demand at runtime by
\fIsmbd\fR\&. Shares defined in
\fIsmb\&.conf\fR
take priority over shares of the same name defined in registry\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
Global
\fIsmb\&.conf\fR
options stored in registry are used\&. This can be activated in two different ways:
.sp
Firstly, a registry only configuration is triggered by setting
\m[blue]\fBconfig backend = registry\fR\m[]
in the [global] section of
\fIsmb\&.conf\fR\&. This resets everything that has been read from config files to this point and reads the content of the global configuration section from the registry\&. This is the recommended method of using registry based configuration\&.
.sp
Secondly, a mixed configuration can be activated by a special new meaning of the parameter
\m[blue]\fBinclude = registry\fR\m[]
in the [global] section of
\fIsmb\&.conf\fR\&. This reads the global options from registry with the same priorities as for an include of a text file\&. This may be especially useful in cases where an initial configuration is needed to access the registry\&.
.sp
Activation of global registry options automatically activates registry shares\&. So in the registry only case, shares are loaded on demand only\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
Note: To make registry\-based configurations foolproof at least to a certain extent, the use of
\fIlock directory\fR
and
\fIconfig backend\fR
inside the registry configuration has been disabled: Especially by changing the
\fIlock directory\fR
inside the registry configuration, one would create a broken setup where the daemons do not see the configuration they loaded once it is active\&.
.PP
The registry configuration can be accessed with tools like
\fIregedit\fR
or
\fInet (rpc) registry\fR
in the key
\fIHKLM\eSoftware\eSamba\esmbconf\fR\&. More conveniently, the
\fIconf\fR
subcommand of the
\fBnet\fR(8)
utility offers a dedicated interface to read and write the registry based configuration locally, i\&.e\&. directly accessing the database file, circumventing the server\&.
.SH "IDENTITY MAPPING CONSIDERATIONS"
.PP
In the SMB protocol, users, groups, and machines are represented by their security identifiers (SIDs)\&. On POSIX system Samba processes need to run under corresponding POSIX user identities and with supplemental POSIX groups to allow access to the files owned by those users and groups\&. The process of mapping SIDs to POSIX users and groups is called
\fIIDENTITY MAPPING\fR
or, in short,
\fIID MAPPING\fR\&.
.PP
Samba supports multiple ways to map SIDs to POSIX users and groups\&. The configuration is driven by the
\m[blue]\fBidmap config DOMAIN : OPTION\fR\m[]
option which allows one to specify identity mapping (idmap) options for each domain separately\&.
.PP
Identity mapping modules implement different strategies for mapping of SIDs to POSIX user and group identities\&. They are applicable to different use cases and scenarios\&. It is advised to read the documentation of the individual identity mapping modules before choosing a specific scenario to use\&. Each identity management module is documented in a separate manual page\&. The standard idmap backends are tdb (\fBidmap_tdb\fR(8)), tdb2 (\fBidmap_tdb2\fR(8)), ldap (\fBidmap_ldap\fR(8)), rid (\fBidmap_rid\fR(8)), hash (\fBidmap_hash\fR(8)), autorid (\fBidmap_autorid\fR(8)), ad (\fBidmap_ad\fR(8)), nss (\fBidmap_nss\fR(8)), and rfc2307 (\fBidmap_rfc2307\fR(8))\&.
.PP
Overall, ID mapping configuration should be decided carefully\&. Changes to the already deployed ID mapping configuration may create the risk of losing access to the data or disclosing the data to the wrong parties\&.
.PP
This example shows how to configure two domains with
\fBidmap_rid\fR(8), the principal domain and a trusted domain, leaving the default id mapping scheme at tdb\&.

acl allow execute always (S)

.RS 4
This boolean parameter controls the behaviour of
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
when receiving a protocol request of "open for execution" from a Windows client\&. With Samba 3\&.6 and older, the execution right in the ACL was not checked, so a client could execute a file even if it did not have execute rights on the file\&. In Samba 4\&.0, this has been fixed, so that by default, i\&.e\&. when this parameter is set to "False", "open for execution" is now denied when execution permissions are not present\&.
.sp
If this parameter is set to "True", Samba does not check execute permissions on "open for execution", thus re\-establishing the behaviour of Samba 3\&.6\&. This can be useful to smoothen upgrades from older Samba versions to 4\&.0 and newer\&. This setting is not meant to be used as a permanent setting, but as a temporary relief: It is recommended to fix the permissions in the ACLs and reset this parameter to the default after a certain transition period\&.

acl check permissions (S)

.RS 4
Please note this parameter is now deprecated in Samba 3\&.6\&.2 and will be removed in a future version of Samba\&.
.sp
This boolean parameter controls what
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
does on receiving a protocol request of "open for delete" from a Windows client\&. If a Windows client doesn\*(Aqt have permissions to delete a file then they expect this to be denied at open time\&. POSIX systems normally only detect restrictions on delete by actually attempting to delete the file or directory\&. As Windows clients can (and do) "back out" a delete request by unsetting the "delete on close" bit Samba cannot delete the file immediately on "open for delete" request as we cannot restore such a deleted file\&. With this parameter set to true (the default) then smbd checks the file system permissions directly on "open for delete" and denies the request without actually deleting the file if the file system permissions would seem to deny it\&. This is not perfect, as it\*(Aqs possible a user could have deleted a file without Samba being able to check the permissions correctly, but it is close enough to Windows semantics for mostly correct behaviour\&. Samba will correctly check POSIX ACL semantics in this case\&.
.sp
If this parameter is set to "false" Samba doesn\*(Aqt check permissions on "open for delete" and allows the open\&. If the user doesn\*(Aqt have permission to delete the file this will only be discovered at close time, which is too late for the Windows user tools to display an error message to the user\&. The symptom of this is files that appear to have been deleted "magically" re\-appearing on a Windows explorer refresh\&. This is an extremely advanced protocol option which should not need to be changed\&. This parameter was introduced in its final form in 3\&.0\&.21, an earlier version with slightly different semantics was introduced in 3\&.0\&.20\&. That older version is not documented here\&.

acl flag inherited canonicalization (S)
.PP
.RS 4
This option controls the way Samba handles client requests setting the Security Descriptor of files and directories and the effect the operation has on the Security Descriptor flag "DACL auto\-inherited" (DI)\&. Generally, this flag is set on a file (or directory) upon creation if the parent directory has DI set and also has inheritable ACEs\&.
.sp
On the other hand when a Security Descriptor is explicitly set on a file, the DI flag is cleared, unless the flag "DACL Inheritance Required" (DR) is also set in the new Security Descriptor (fwiw, DR is never stored on disk)\&.
.sp
This is the default behaviour when this option is enabled (the default)\&. When setting this option to
no, the resulting value of the DI flag on\-disk is directly taken from the DI value of the to\-be\-set Security Descriptor\&. This can be used so dump tools like rsync that copy data blobs from xattrs that represent ACLs created by the acl_xattr VFS module will result in copies of the ACL that are identical to the source\&. Without this option, the copied ACLs would all loose the DI flag if set on the source\&.

acl group control (S)
.PP
.RS 4
In a POSIX filesystem, only the owner of a file or directory and the superuser can modify the permissions and ACLs on a file\&. If this parameter is set, then Samba overrides this restriction, and also allows the
\fIprimary group owner\fR
of a file or directory to modify the permissions and ACLs on that file\&.
.sp
On a Windows server, groups may be the owner of a file or directory \- thus allowing anyone in that group to modify the permissions on it\&. This allows the delegation of security controls on a point in the filesystem to the group owner of a directory and anything below it also owned by that group\&. This means there are multiple people with permissions to modify ACLs on a file or directory, easing manageability\&.
.sp
This parameter allows Samba to also permit delegation of the control over a point in the exported directory hierarchy in much the same way as Windows\&. This allows all members of a UNIX group to control the permissions on a file or directory they have group ownership on\&.
.sp
This parameter is best used with the
\m[blue]\fBinherit owner\fR\m[]
option and also on a share containing directories with the UNIX
\fIsetgid bit\fR
set on them, which causes new files and directories created within it to inherit the group ownership from the containing directory\&.

.sp
For name service it causes

nmbd

nmbd
will service name requests on all of these sockets\&. If

is set then
nmbd
will check the source address of any packets coming in on the broadcast sockets and discard any that don\*(Aqt match the broadcast addresses of the interfaces in the
\m[blue]\fBinterfaces\fR\m[]
parameter list\&. As unicast packets are received on the other sockets it allows
nmbd
to refuse to serve names to machines that send packets that arrive through any interfaces not listed in the

For file service it causes

ctdb locktime warn threshold (G)
.PP
.RS 4
In a cluster environment using Samba and ctdb it is critical that locks on central ctdb\-hosted databases like locking\&.tdb are not held for long\&. With the current Samba architecture it happens that Samba takes a lock and while holding that lock makes file system calls into the shared cluster file system\&. This option makes Samba warn if it detects that it has held locks for the specified number of milliseconds\&. If this happens,

This parameter specifies a timeout in milliseconds for the connection between Samba and ctdb\&. It is only valid if you have compiled Samba with clustering and if you have set

.sp
When something in the cluster blocks, it can happen that we wait indefinitely long for ctdb, just adding to the blocking condition\&. In a well\-running cluster this should never happen, but there are too many components in a cluster that might have hickups\&. Choosing the right balance for this value is very tricky, because on a busy cluster long service times to transfer something across the cluster might be valid\&. Setting it too short will degrade the service your cluster presents, setting it too long might make the cluster itself not recover from something severely broken for too long\&.
.sp
Be aware that if you set this parameter, this needs to be in the file smb\&.conf, it is not really helpful to put this into a registry configuration (typical on a cluster), because to access the registry contact to ctdb is required\&.

Setting
\fIctdb timeout\fR

This parameter is only applicable to

This deprecated parameter controls whether or not smbd will honor privileges assigned to specific SIDs via either
net rpc rights

That is, in the future, the current default of

This boolean controls whether encrypted passwords will be negotiated with the client\&. Note that Windows NT 4\&.0 SP3 and above and also Windows 98 will by default expect encrypted passwords unless a registry entry is changed\&. To use encrypted passwords in Samba see the chapter "User Database" in the Samba HOWTO Collection\&.

enumports command (G)

The concept of a "port" is fairly foreign to UNIX hosts\&. Under Windows NT/2000 print servers, a port is associated with a port monitor and generally takes the form of a local port (i\&.e\&. LPT1:, COM1:, FILE:) or a remote port (i\&.e\&. LPD Port Monitor, etc\&.\&.\&.)\&. By default, Samba has only one port defined\-\-\fB"Samba Printer Port"\fR\&. Under Windows NT/2000, all printers must have a valid port name\&. If you wish to have a list of ports displayed (smbd

fake directory create times (S)
.PP
.RS 4
NTFS and Windows VFAT file systems keep a create time for all files and directories\&. This is not the same as the ctime \- status change time \- that Unix keeps, so Samba by default reports the earliest of the various times Unix does keep\&. Setting this parameter for a share causes Samba to always report midnight 1\-1\-1980 as the create time for directories\&.
.sp
This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++ when used against Samba shares\&. Visual C++ generated makefiles have the object directory as a dependency for each object file, and a make rule to create the directory\&. Also, when NMAKE compares timestamps it uses the creation time when examining a directory\&. Thus the object directory will be created if it does not exist, but once it does exist it will always have an earlier timestamp than the object files it contains\&.
.sp
However, Unix time semantics mean that the create time reported by Samba will be updated whenever a file is created or deleted in the directory\&. NMAKE finds all object files in the object directory\&. The timestamp of the last one built is then compared to the timestamp of the object directory\&. If the directory\*(Aqs timestamp if newer, then all object files will be rebuilt\&. Enabling this option ensures directories always predate their contents and an NMAKE build will proceed as expected\&.

fake oplocks (S)
.PP
.RS 4
Oplocks are the way that SMB clients get permission from a server to locally cache file operations\&. If a server grants an oplock (opportunistic lock) then the client is free to assume that it is the only one accessing the file and it will aggressively cache file data\&. With some oplock types the client may even cache file open/close operations\&. This can give enormous performance benefits\&.
.sp
When you set
fake oplocks = yes,
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
will always grant oplock requests no matter how many clients are using the file\&.
.sp
It is generally much better to use the real
\m[blue]\fBoplocks\fR\m[]
support rather than this parameter\&.
.sp
If you enable this option on all read\-only shares or shares that you know will only be accessed from one client at a time such as physically read\-only media like CDROMs, you will see a big performance improvement on many operations\&. If you enable this option on shares where multiple clients may be accessing the files read\-write at the same time you can get data corruption\&. Use this option carefully!

.RS 4
This specifies a UNIX group name that will be assigned as the default primary group for all users connecting to this service\&. This is useful for sharing files by ensuring that all access to files on service will use the named group for their permissions checking\&. Thus, by assigning permissions for this group to the files and directories within this service the Samba administrator can restrict or allow sharing of these files\&.
.sp
In Samba 2\&.0\&.5 and above this parameter has extended functionality in the following way\&. If the group name listed here has a \*(Aq+\*(Aq character prepended to it then the current user accessing the share only has the primary group default assigned to this group if they are already assigned as a member of that group\&. This allows an administrator to decide that only users who are already in a particular group will create files with group ownership set to that group\&. This gives a finer granularity of ownership assignment\&. For example, the setting
force group = +sys
means that only users who are already in group sys will have their default primary group assigned to sys when accessing this Samba share\&. All other users will retain their ordinary primary group\&.

force printername (S)

.RS 4
When printing from Windows NT (or later), each printer in

The second name associated with a printer can be seen when browsing to the "Printers" (or "Printers and Faxes") folder on the Samba server\&. This is referred to simply as the printername (not to be confused with the
\fIprinter name\fR
option)\&.
.sp
When assigning a new driver to a printer on a remote Windows compatible print server such as Samba, the Windows client will rename the printer to match the driver name just uploaded\&. This can result in confusion for users when multiple printers are bound to the same driver\&. To prevent Samba from allowing the printer\*(Aqs printername to differ from the sharename defined in smb\&.conf, set

Be aware that enabling this parameter may affect migrating printers from a Windows server to Samba since Windows has no way to force the sharename and printername to match\&.

idmap config DOMAIN : OPTION (G)
.PP
.RS 4
ID mapping in Samba is the mapping between Windows SIDs and Unix user and group IDs\&. This is performed by Winbindd with a configurable plugin interface\&. Samba\*(Aqs ID mapping is configured by options starting with the
\m[blue]\fBidmap config\fR\m[]
prefix\&. An idmap option consists of the
\m[blue]\fBidmap config\fR\m[]
prefix, followed by a domain name or the asterisk character (*), a colon, and the name of an idmap setting for the chosen domain\&.
.sp
The idmap configuration is hence divided into groups, one group for each domain to be configured, and one group with the asterisk instead of a proper domain name, which specifies the default configuration that is used to catch all domains that do not have an explicit idmap configuration of their own\&.
.sp
There are three general options available:
.PP
backend = backend_name
.RS 4
This specifies the name of the idmap plugin to use as the SID/uid/gid backend for this domain\&. The standard backends are tdb (\fBidmap_tdb\fR(8)), tdb2 (\fBidmap_tdb2\fR(8)), ldap (\fBidmap_ldap\fR(8)), rid (\fBidmap_rid\fR(8)), hash (\fBidmap_hash\fR(8)), autorid (\fBidmap_autorid\fR(8)), ad (\fBidmap_ad\fR(8)) and nss (\fBidmap_nss\fR(8))\&. The corresponding manual pages contain the details, but here is a summary\&.
.sp
The first three of these create mappings of their own using internal unixid counters and store the mappings in a database\&. These are suitable for use in the default idmap configuration\&. The rid and hash backends use a pure algorithmic calculation to determine the unixid for a SID\&. The autorid module is a mixture of the tdb and rid backend\&. It creates ranges for each domain encountered and then uses the rid algorithm for each of these automatically configured domains individually\&. The ad backend uses unix ids stored in Active Directory via the standard schema extensions\&. The nss backend reverses the standard winbindd setup and gets the unix ids via names from nsswitch which can be useful in an ldap setup\&.
.RE
.PP
range = low \- high
.RS 4

winbind uses this parameter to find the backend that is authoritative for a unix ID to SID mapping, so it must be set for each individually configured domain and for the default configuration\&. The configured ranges must be mutually disjoint\&.
.sp
Note that the low value interacts with the

Common scenarios where this behavior is useful is in implementing drop\-boxes, where users can create and edit files but not delete them and ensuring that newly created files in a user\*(Aqs roaming profile directory are actually owned by the user\&.
.sp
The
\fBunix only\fR
option effectively breaks the tie between the Windows owner of a file and the UNIX owner\&. As a logical consequence, in this mode, setting the the Windows owner of a file does not modify the UNIX owner\&.

kerberos encryption types (G)
.PP
.RS 4
This parameter determines the encryption types to use when operating as a Kerberos client\&. Possible values are
\fIall\fR,
\fIstrong\fR, and
\fIlegacy\fR\&.
.sp
Samba uses a Kerberos library (MIT or Heimdal) to obtain Kerberos tickets\&. This library is normally configured outside of Samba, using the krb5\&.conf file\&. This file may also include directives to configure the encryption types to be used\&. However, Samba implements Active Directory protocols and algorithms to locate a domain controller\&. In order to force the Kerberos library into using the correct domain controller, some Samba processes, such as
\fBwinbindd\fR(8)
and
\fBnet\fR(8), build a private krb5\&.conf file for use by the Kerberos library while being invoked from Samba\&. This private file controls all aspects of the Kerberos library operation, and this parameter controls how the encryption types are configured within this generated file, and therefore also controls the encryption types negotiable by Samba\&.
.sp
When set to
\fBall\fR, all active directory encryption types are allowed\&.
.sp
When set to
\fBstrong\fR, only AES\-based encryption types are offered\&. This can be used in hardened environments to prevent downgrade attacks\&.
.sp
When set to
\fBlegacy\fR, only RC4\-HMAC\-MD5 is allowed\&. Avoiding AES this way has one a very specific use\&. Normally, the encryption type is negotiated between the peers\&. However, there is one scenario in which a Windows read\-only domain controller (RODC) advertises AES encryption, but then proxies the request to a writeable DC which may not support AES encryption, leading to failure of the handshake\&. Setting this parameter to
\fBlegacy\fR
would cause samba not to negotiate AES encryption\&. It is assumed of course that the weaker legacy encryption types are acceptable for the setup\&.

.sp
This parameter determines whether or not

.sp
The LANMAN encrypted response is easily broken, due to its case\-insensitive nature, and the choice of algorithm\&. Servers without Windows 95/98/ME or MS DOS clients are advised to disable this option\&.

When this parameter is set to

this will also result in sambaLMPassword in Samba\*(Aqs passdb being blanked after the next password change\&. As a result of that lanman clients won\*(Aqt be able to authenticate, even if lanman auth is re\-enabled later on\&.

One important question a user needs to know is the list of groups he is member of\&. The plain UNIX model involves a complete enumeration of the file /etc/group and its NSS counterparts in LDAP\&.

level2 oplocks (S)
.PP
.RS 4
This parameter controls whether Samba supports level2 (read\-only) oplocks on a share\&.
.sp
Level2, or read\-only oplocks allow Windows NT clients that have an oplock on a file to downgrade from a read\-write oplock to a read\-only oplock once a second client opens the file (instead of releasing all oplocks on a second open, as in traditional, exclusive oplocks)\&. This allows all openers of the file that support level2 oplocks to cache the file for read\-ahead only (ie\&. they may not cache writes or lock requests) and increases performance for many accesses of files that are not commonly written (such as application \&.EXE files)\&.
.sp
Once one of the clients which have a read\-only oplock writes to the file all clients are notified (no reply is needed or waited for) and told to break their oplocks to "none" and delete any read\-ahead caches\&.
.sp
It is recommended that this parameter be turned on to speed access to shared executables\&.
.sp
For more discussions on level2 oplocks see the CIFS spec\&.
.sp
Currently, if
\m[blue]\fBkernel oplocks\fR\m[]
are supported then level2 oplocks are not granted (even if this parameter is set to
\fByes\fR)\&. Note also, the
\m[blue]\fBoplocks\fR\m[]

\fBauto\fR\&. If set to

Samba will never produce these broadcasts\&. If set to

\fIEffects for SMB1\fR
.RS 4
The Samba\-specific encryption of SMB1 connections is an extension to the SMB protocol negotiated as part of the UNIX extensions\&. SMB encryption uses the GSSAPI (SSPI on Windows) ability to encrypt and sign every request/response in a SMB protocol stream\&. When enabled it provides a secure method of SMB/CIFS communication, similar to an ssh protected session, but using SMB/CIFS authentication to negotiate encryption and signing keys\&. Currently this is only supported smbclient of by Samba 3\&.2 and newer, and hopefully soon Linux CIFSFS and MacOS/X clients\&. Windows clients do not support this feature\&.
.sp
This may be set on a per\-share basis, but clients may chose to encrypt the entire session, not just traffic to a specific share\&. If this is set to mandatory then all traffic to a share
\fImust\fR
be encrypted once the connection has been made to the share\&. The server would return "access denied" to all non\-encrypted requests on such a share\&. Selecting encrypted traffic reduces throughput as smaller packet sizes must be used (no huge UNIX style read/writes allowed) as well as the overhead of encrypting and signing all the data\&.
.sp
If SMB encryption is selected, Windows style SMB signing (see the
\m[blue]\fBserver signing\fR\m[]
option) is no longer necessary, as the GSSAPI flags use select both signing and sealing of the data\&.

show add printer wizard (G)

With the introduction of MS\-RPC based printing support for Windows NT/2000 client in Samba 2\&.2, a "Printers\&.\&.\&." folder will appear on Samba hosts in the share listing\&. Normally this folder will contain an icon for the MS Add Printer Wizard (APW)\&. However, it is possible to disable this feature regardless of the level of privilege of the connected user\&.

Under normal circumstances, the Windows NT/2000 client will open a handle on the printer server with OpenPrinterEx() asking for Administrator privileges\&. If the user does not have administrative access on the print server (i\&.e is not root or has granted the SePrintOperatorPrivilege), the OpenPrinterEx() call fails and the client makes another open call with a request for a lower privilege level\&. This should succeed, however the APW icon will not be displayed\&.

store dos attributes (S)

If this parameter is set Samba attempts to first read DOS attributes (SYSTEM, HIDDEN, ARCHIVE or READ\-ONLY) from a filesystem extended attribute, before mapping DOS attributes to UNIX permission bits (such as occurs with
\m[blue]\fBmap hidden\fR\m[]
and
\m[blue]\fBmap readonly\fR\m[])\&. When set, DOS attributes will be stored onto an extended attribute in the UNIX filesystem, associated with the file or directory\&. When this parameter is set it will override the parameters

\m[blue]\fBmap system\fR\m[],
\m[blue]\fBmap archive\fR\m[]
and
\m[blue]\fBmap readonly\fR\m[]
and they will behave as if they were set to off\&. This parameter writes the DOS attributes as a string into the extended attribute named "user\&.DOSATTRIB"\&. This extended attribute is explicitly hidden from smbd clients requesting an EA list\&. On Linux the filesystem must have been mounted with the mount option user_xattr in order for extended attributes to work, also extended attributes must be compiled into the Linux kernel\&. In Samba 3\&.5\&.0 and above the "user\&.DOSATTRIB" extended attribute has been extended to store the create time for a file as well as the DOS attributes\&. This is done in a backwards compatible way so files created by Samba 3\&.5\&.0 and above can still have the DOS attribute read from this extended attribute by earlier versions of Samba, but they will not be able to read the create time stored there\&. Storing the create time separately from the normal filesystem meta\-data allows Samba to faithfully reproduce NTFS semantics on top of a POSIX filesystem\&. The default has changed to yes in Samba release 4\&.9\&.0 and above to allow better Windows fileserver compatibility in a default install\&.

strict allocate (S)
.PP
.RS 4
This is a boolean that controls the handling of disk space allocation in the server\&. When this is set to
\fByes\fR
the server will change from UNIX behaviour of not committing real disk storage blocks when a file is extended to the Windows behaviour of actually forcing the disk system to allocate real storage blocks when a file is created or extended to be a given size\&. In UNIX terminology this means that Samba will stop creating sparse files\&.
.sp
This option is really designed for file systems that support fast allocation of large numbers of blocks such as extent\-based file systems\&. On file systems that don\*(Aqt support extents (most notably ext3) this can make Samba slower\&. When you work with large files over >100MB on file systems without extents you may even run into problems with clients running into timeouts\&.
.sp
When you have an extent based filesystem it\*(Aqs likely that we can make use of unwritten extents which allows Samba to allocate even large amounts of space very fast and you will not see any timeout problems caused by strict allocate\&. With strict allocate in use you will also get much better out of quota messages in case you use quotas\&. Another advantage of activating this setting is that it will help to reduce file fragmentation\&.
.sp
To give you an idea on which filesystems this setting might currently be a good option for you: XFS, ext4, btrfs, ocfs2 on Linux and JFS2 on AIX support unwritten extents\&. On Filesystems that do not support it, preallocation is probably an expensive operation where you will see reduced performance and risk to let clients run into timeouts when creating large files\&. Examples are ext3, ZFS, HFS+ and most others, so be aware if you activate this setting on those filesystems\&.

strict locking (S)

This is an enumerated type that controls the handling of file locking in the server\&. When this is set to

.sp
When strict locking is set to Auto (the default), the server performs file lock checks only on non\-oplocked files\&. As most Windows redirectors perform file locking checks locally on oplocked files this is a good trade off for improved performance\&.
.sp
When strict locking is disabled, the server performs file lock checks only when the client explicitly asks for them\&.

Well\-behaved clients always ask for lock checks when it is important\&. So in the vast majority of cases,

strict rename (S)
.PP
.RS 4
By default a Windows SMB server prevents directory renames when there are open file or directory handles below it in the filesystem hierarchy\&. Historically Samba has always allowed this as POSIX filesystem semantics require it\&.
.sp
This boolean parameter allows Samba to match the Windows behavior\&. Setting this to "yes" is a very expensive change, as it forces Samba to travers the entire open file handle database on every directory rename request\&. In a clustered Samba system the cost is even greater than the non\-clustered case\&.
.sp
When set to "no" smbd only checks the local process the client is attached to for open files below a directory being renamed, instead of checking for open files across all smbd processes\&.
.sp
Because of the expense in fully searching the database, the default is "no", and it is recommended to be left that way unless a specific Windows application requires it to be changed\&.

This parameter controls whether Samba honors a request from an SMB client to ensure any outstanding operating system buffer contents held in memory are safely written onto stable storage on disk\&. If set to

then smbd will ignore client requests to synchronize unwritten data onto stable storage on disk\&.
.sp
In Samba 4\&.7\&.0, the default for this parameter changed from
\fBno\fR
to
\fByes\fR
to better match the expectations of SMB2/3 clients and improve application safety when running against smbd\&.
.sp
The flush request from SMB2/3 clients is handled asynchronously inside smbd, so leaving the parameter as the default value of
\fByes\fR
does not block the processing of other requests to the smbd process\&.

Legacy Windows applications (such as the Windows 98 explorer shell) seemed to confuse writing buffer contents to the operating system with synchronously writing outstanding data onto stable storage on disk\&. Changing this parameter to

.PP
.RS 4
This global parameter determines if the tdb internals of Samba can depend on mmap working correctly on the running system\&. Samba requires a coherent mmap/read\-write system memory cache\&. Currently only OpenBSD and HPUX do not have such a coherent cache, and on those platforms this paramter is overridden internally to be effeceively
\fBno\fR\&. On all systems this parameter should be left alone\&. This parameter is provided to help the Samba developers track down problems with the tdb internal code\&.

username level (G)
.PP
.RS 4
This option helps Samba to try and \*(Aqguess\*(Aq at the real UNIX username, as many DOS clients send an all\-uppercase username\&. By default Samba tries all lowercase, followed by the username with the first letter capitalized, and fails if the username is not found on the UNIX machine\&.
.sp
If this parameter is set to non\-zero the behavior changes\&. This parameter is a number that specifies the number of uppercase combinations to try while trying to determine the UNIX user name\&. The higher the number the more combinations will be tried, but the slower the discovery of usernames will be\&. Use this parameter when you have strange usernames on your UNIX machine, such as
\fBAstrangeUser \fR\&.

This parameter is needed only on UNIX systems that have case sensitive usernames\&.

.RE

username map (G)
.PP
.RS 4
This option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server\&. This can be used for several purposes\&. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX box uses\&. The other is to map multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share files\&.
.sp
Please note that for user mode security, the username map is applied prior to validating the user credentials\&. Domain member servers (domain or ads) apply the username map after the user has been successfully authenticated by the domain controller and require fully qualified entries in the map table (e\&.g\&. biddle =
DOMAIN\efoo)\&.
.sp
The map file is parsed line by line\&. Each line should contain a single UNIX username on the left then a \*(Aq=\*(Aq followed by a list of usernames on the right\&. The list of usernames on the right may contain names of the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX username in that group\&. The special client name \*(Aq*\*(Aq is a wildcard and matches any name\&. Each line of the map file may be up to 1023 characters long\&.
.sp
The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and comparing it with each username on the right hand side of the \*(Aq=\*(Aq signs\&. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the name on the left\&. Processing then continues with the next line\&.
.sp
If any line begins with a \*(Aq#\*(Aq or a \*(Aq;\*(Aq then it is ignored\&.
.sp
If any line begins with an \*(Aq!\*(Aq then the processing will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the line\&. Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed\&. Using \*(Aq!\*(Aq is most useful when you have a wildcard mapping line later in the file\&.
.sp
For example to map from the name
\fBadmin\fR
or
\fBadministrator\fR
to the UNIX name
\fB root\fR
you would use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
root = admin administrator
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Or to map anyone in the UNIX group
\fBsystem\fR
to the UNIX name
\fBsys\fR
you would use:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
sys = @system
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You can have as many mappings as you like in a username map file\&.
.sp
If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then the netgroup database is checked before the
/etc/group
database for matching groups\&.
.sp
You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them by using double quotes around the name\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
tridge = "Andrew Tridgell"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the unix username "tridge"\&.
.sp
The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys, and map the rest to guest\&. Note the use of the \*(Aq!\*(Aq to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on that line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
!sys = mary fred
guest = *
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of usernames\&. Thus if you connect to \e\eserver\efred and
\fBfred\fR
is remapped to
\fBmary\fR
then you will actually be connecting to \e\eserver\emary and will need to supply a password suitable for
\fBmary\fR
not
\fBfred\fR\&. The only exception to this is the username passed to a Domain Controller (if you have one)\&. The DC will receive whatever username the client supplies without modification\&.
.sp
Also note that no reverse mapping is done\&. The main effect this has is with printing\&. Users who have been mapped may have trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think they don\*(Aqt own the print job\&.
.sp
Samba versions prior to 3\&.0\&.8 would only support reading the fully qualified username (e\&.g\&.:
DOMAIN\euser) from the username map when performing a kerberos login from a client\&. However, when looking up a map entry for a user authenticated by NTLM[SSP], only the login name would be used for matches\&. This resulted in inconsistent behavior sometimes even on the same server\&.
.sp
The following functionality is obeyed in version 3\&.0\&.8 and later:
.sp
When performing local authentication, the username map is applied to the login name before attempting to authenticate the connection\&.
.sp
When relying upon a external domain controller for validating authentication requests, smbd will apply the username map to the fully qualified username (i\&.e\&.
DOMAIN\euser) only after the user has been successfully authenticated\&.
.sp
An example of use is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
username map = /usr/local/samba/lib/users\&.map

.RS 4
Mapping usernames with the

winbind normalize names (G)

This parameter controls whether winbindd will replace whitespace in user and group names with an underscore (_) character\&. For example, whether the name "Space Kadet" should be replaced with the string "space_kadet"\&. Frequently Unix shell scripts will have difficulty with usernames contains whitespace due to the default field separator in the shell\&. If your domain possesses names containing the underscore character, this option may cause problems unless the name aliasing feature is supported by your nss_info plugin\&.
.sp
This feature also enables the name aliasing API which can be used to make domain user and group names to a non\-qualified version\&. Please refer to the manpage for the configured idmap and nss_info plugin for the specifics on how to configure name aliasing for a specific configuration\&.
