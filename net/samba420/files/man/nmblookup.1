.SH "NAME"
nmblookup \- NetBIOS over TCP/IP client used to lookup NetBIOS names
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
nmblookup [\-M|\-\-master\-browser] [\-\-recursion] [\-S|\-\-status] [\-r|\-\-root\-port] [\-A|\-\-lookup\-by\-ip] [\-B|\-\-broadcast=BROADCAST\-ADDRESS] [\-U|\-\-unicast=UNICAST\-ADDRESS] [\-T|\-\-translate] [\-f|\-\-flags] [\-?|\-\-help] [\-\-usage] [\-d|\-\-debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL] [\-\-debug\-stdout] [\-\-configfile=CONFIGFILE] [\-\-option=name=value] [\-l|\-\-log\-basename=LOGFILEBASE] [\-\-leak\-report] [\-\-leak\-report\-full] [\-R|\-\-name\-resolve=NAME\-RESOLVE\-ORDER] [\-O|\-\-socket\-options=SOCKETOPTIONS] [\-m|\-\-max\-protocol=MAXPROTOCOL] [\-n|\-\-netbiosname=NETBIOSNAME] [\-\-netbios\-scope=SCOPE] [\-W|\-\-workgroup=WORKGROUP] [\-\-realm=REALM] {name}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
nmblookup
is used to query NetBIOS names and map them to IP addresses in a network using NetBIOS over TCP/IP queries\&. The options allow the name queries to be directed at a particular IP broadcast area or to a particular machine\&. All queries are done over UDP\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-M|\-\-master\-browser
.RS 4
Searches for a master browser by looking up the NetBIOS
\fIname\fR
with a type of
\fB0x1d\fR\&. If
\fI name\fR
is "\-" then it does a lookup on the special name
\fB__MSBROWSE__\fR\&. Please note that in order to use the name "\-", you need to make sure "\-" isn\*(Aqt parsed as an argument, e\&.g\&. use :
\fBnmblookup \-M \-\- \-\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-recursion
.RS 4
Set the recursion desired bit in the packet to do a recursive lookup\&. This is used when sending a name query to a machine running a WINS server and the user wishes to query the names in the WINS server\&. If this bit is unset the normal (broadcast responding) NetBIOS processing code on a machine is used instead\&. See RFC1001, RFC1002 for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S|\-\-status
.RS 4
Once the name query has returned an IP address then do a node status query as well\&. A node status query returns the NetBIOS names registered by a host\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r|\-\-root\-port
.RS 4
Try and bind to UDP port 137 to send and receive UDP datagrams\&. The reason for this option is a bug in Windows 95 where it ignores the source port of the requesting packet and only replies to UDP port 137\&. Unfortunately, on most UNIX systems root privilege is needed to bind to this port, and in addition, if the
\fBnmbd\fR(8)
daemon is running on this machine it also binds to this port\&.
.RE
.PP
\-A|\-\-lookup\-by\-ip
.RS 4
Interpret
\fIname\fR
as an IP Address and do a node status query on this address\&.
.RE
.PP
\-B|\-\-broadcast <broadcast address>
.RS 4
Send the query to the given broadcast address\&. Without this option the default behavior of nmblookup is to send the query to the broadcast address of the network interfaces as either auto\-detected or defined in the
\fIinterfaces\fR
parameter of the
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-U|\-\-unicast <unicast address>
.RS 4
Do a unicast query to the specified address or host
\fIunicast address\fR\&. This option (along with the
\fI\-R\fR
option) is needed to query a WINS server\&.
.RE
.PP
\-T|\-\-translate
.RS 4
This causes any IP addresses found in the lookup to be looked up via a reverse DNS lookup into a DNS name, and printed out before each
.sp
\fIIP address \&.\&.\&.\&. NetBIOS name\fR
.sp
pair that is the normal output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f|\-\-flags
.RS 4
Show which flags apply to the name that has been looked up\&. Possible answers are zero or more of: Response, Authoritative, Truncated, Recursion_Desired, Recursion_Available, Broadcast\&.
.RE
.PP
name
.RS 4
This is the NetBIOS name being queried\&. Depending upon the previous options this may be a NetBIOS name or IP address\&. If a NetBIOS name then the different name types may be specified by appending \*(Aq#<type>\*(Aq to the name\&. This name may also be \*(Aq*\*(Aq, which will return all registered names within a broadcast area\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d|\-\-debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL
.RS 4
\fIlevel\fR
is an integer from 0 to 10\&. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 1 for client applications\&.
.sp
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server\&. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged\&. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day\-to\-day running \- it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out\&.
.sp
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem\&. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
\m[blue]\fBlog level\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug\-stdout
.RS 4
This will redirect debug output to STDOUT\&. By default all clients are logging to STDERR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-configfile=<configuration file>
.RS 4
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the client\&. The information in this file can be general for client and server or only provide client specific like options such as
\m[blue]\fBclient smb encrypt\fR\m[]\&. See
smb\&.conf
for more information\&. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-option=<name>=<value>
.RS 4
Set the
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
option "<name>" to value "<value>" from the command line\&. This overrides compiled\-in defaults and options read from the configuration file\&. If a name or a value includes a space, wrap whole \-\-option=name=value into quotes\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l|\-\-log\-basename=logdirectory
.RS 4
Base directory name for log/debug files\&. The extension
\fB"\&.progname"\fR
will be appended (e\&.g\&. log\&.smbclient, log\&.smbd, etc\&.\&.\&.)\&. The log file is never removed by the client\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-leak\-report
.RS 4
Enable talloc leak reporting on exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-leak\-report\-full
.RS 4
Enable full talloc leak reporting on exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V|\-\-version
.RS 4
Prints the program version number\&.
.RE
.PP
\-R|\-\-name\-resolve=NAME\-RESOLVE\-ORDER
.RS 4
This option is used to determine what naming services and in what order to resolve host names to IP addresses\&. The option takes a space\-separated string of different name resolution options\&. The best ist to wrap the whole \-\-name\-resolve=NAME\-RESOLVE\-ORDER into quotes\&.
.sp
The options are: "lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast"\&. They cause names to be resolved as follows:
.RS
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBlmhosts\fR: Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file\&. If the line in lmhosts has no name type attached to the NetBIOS name (see the
\fBlmhosts\fR(5)
for details) then any name type matches for lookup\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBhost\fR: Do a standard host name to IP address resolution, using the system
/etc/hosts, NIS, or DNS lookups\&. This method of name resolution is operating system dependent, for instance on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled by the
/etc/nsswitch\&.conf
file)\&. Note that this method is only used if the NetBIOS name type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type, otherwise it is ignored\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBwins\fR: Query a name with the IP address listed in the
\fIwins server\fR
parameter\&. If no WINS server has been specified this method will be ignored\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBbcast\fR: Do a broadcast on each of the known local interfaces listed in the
\fIinterfaces\fR
parameter\&. This is the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it depends on the target host being on a locally connected subnet\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order defined in the
smb\&.conf
file parameter (\m[blue]\fBname resolve order\fR\m[]) will be used\&.
.sp
The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast\&. Without this parameter or any entry in the
\m[blue]\fBname resolve order\fR\m[]
parameter of the
smb\&.conf
file, the name resolution methods will be attempted in this order\&.
.RE
.PP
\-O|\-\-socket\-options=SOCKETOPTIONS
.RS 4
TCP socket options to set on the client socket\&. See the socket options parameter in the
smb\&.conf
manual page for the list of valid options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m|\-\-max\-protocol=MAXPROTOCOL
.RS 4
The value of the parameter (a string) is the highest protocol level that will be supported by the client\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
\m[blue]\fBclient max protocol\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n|\-\-netbiosname=NETBIOSNAME
.RS 4
This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself\&. This is identical to setting the
\m[blue]\fBnetbios name\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&. However, a command line setting will take precedence over settings in
smb\&.conf\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-netbios\-scope=SCOPE
.RS 4
This specifies a NetBIOS scope that
nmblookup
will use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names\&. For details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001\&.txt and rfc1002\&.txt\&. NetBIOS scopes are
\fIvery\fR
rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you communicate with\&.
.RE
.PP
\-W|\-\-workgroup=WORKGROUP
.RS 4
Set the SMB domain of the username\&. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in smb\&.conf\&. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the client to log on using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM)\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
\m[blue]\fBworkgroup\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r|\-\-realm=REALM
.RS 4
Set the realm for the domain\&.
.sp
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the
\m[blue]\fBrealm\fR\m[]
parameter in the
smb\&.conf
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-?|\-\-help
.RS 4
Print a summary of command line options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-usage
.RS 4
Display brief usage message\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
nmblookup
can be used to query a WINS server (in the same way
nslookup
is used to query DNS servers)\&. To query a WINS server,
nmblookup
must be called like this:
.PP
nmblookup \-U server \-R \*(Aqname\*(Aq
.PP
For example, running :
.PP
nmblookup \-U samba\&.org \-R \*(AqIRIX#1B\*(Aq
.PP
would query the WINS server samba\&.org for the domain master browser (1B name type) for the IRIX workgroup\&.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
This man page is part of version 4\&.16\&.4 of the Samba suite\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
