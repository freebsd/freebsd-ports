======================================================================
You installed CJDNS: IPv6 routing engine

It is recommended to run CJDNS as a service:
# sysrc cjdns_enable="YES"
# service cjdns start

When started the first time, CJDNS will create the config file
%%PREFIX%%/etc/cjdroute.conf that you should edit to make CJDNS connected:
* You may want to add some nodes to connect to the section "connectTo"
  from some of these sites:
  * https://pad.meshwith.me/p/public
  * http://cjdns.me/
  * https://github.com/hyperboria/peers
* You may want to uncomment "tunDevice" to make CJDNS always use the same
  tun device.

In order to be able to open IPv6 websites available through CJDNS network
that you connect to, you need to add the IPv6 default route:
# route -6 add default fc00::1

In order to create an IPv4 or IPv6 VPN, on the server in the section
ipTunnel/allowedConnections of the config file you need to add the public
keys of the clients, and to define the VPN network. On the clients you
only need to add the public key of the server in the section
ipTunnel/outgoingConnections. You may also need to bridge the tunN
interface on the server to connect the segments of the VPN network.

Here are some websites on the CJDNS Hyperboria network:
* http://socialno.de/ - social network
* https://rows.io/ - Jabber server
* http://forum.meshbits.io/ - forums
* http://h.fc00.org/ - network map

Warning: When the CJDNS daemon is connected to an outside network, tunN
interface will generally directly expose your computer to that network,
bypassing the regular firewall that you normally use.
