You have to set PVM_ROOT=%%PREFIX%%/lib/pvm enviropment variable on all machines
which you are planning to use for distributed computing. The best way to set
this variable on system-wide basis is to add "PVM_ROOT=%%PREFIX%%/lib/pvm" into
appropriate section of your /etc/login.conf file. You also have to enable
rshd on those machines.
