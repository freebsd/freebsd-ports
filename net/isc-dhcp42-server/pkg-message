****  To setup dhcpd, please edit %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf.

****  This port installs the dhcp daemon, but doesn't invoke dhcpd by default.
      If you want to invoke dhcpd at startup, add these lines to /etc/rc.conf:

	    dhcpd_enable="YES"				# dhcpd enabled?
	    dhcpd_flags="-q"				# command option(s)
	    dhcpd_conf="%%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf"	# configuration file
	    dhcpd_ifaces=""				# ethernet interface(s)
	    dhcpd_withumask="022"			# file creation mask

****  If compiled with paranoia support (the default), the following rc.conf
      options are also supported:

	    dhcpd_chuser_enable="YES"		# runs w/o privileges?
	    dhcpd_withuser="dhcpd"		# user name to run as
	    dhcpd_withgroup="dhcpd"		# group name to run as
	    dhcpd_chroot_enable="YES"		# runs chrooted?
	    dhcpd_devfs_enable="YES"		# use devfs if available?
	    dhcpd_rootdir="/var/db/dhcpd"	# directory to run in
	    dhcpd_includedir="<some_dir>"	# directory with config-
						  files to include

****  WARNING: never edit the chrooted or jailed dhcpd.conf file but
      %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf instead which is always copied where
      needed upon startup.
