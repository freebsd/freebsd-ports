This is the shared library which allows change IP-address from which
will be performing TCP-connection of network applications. This is 
extremely useful when you need to control this but programs you are
using have no configuration options specifying to which IP-address they
should bind.

To use this library you need only to set up environment variable CONN_ADDR
to the IP-address to bind and then use LD_PRELOAD to pre-load this library
for the application.

Does not work with statically linked programs (there are not too much of
them hopefully).
