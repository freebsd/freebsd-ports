ctrace is an IPv4 traceroute tool that supports many features missing
in standard 4.3BSD traceroute(8). It is programmed entirely in perl.

The primary difference between ctrace and other traceroute tools is
its ability to trace routes in multiple protocols. ctrace also has
some additional nifty features:
* Automatic round-trip-time (RTT) averaging, which makes output
  cleaner and more intelligible.
* One or more packets can be launched per TTL/hop. By way of contrast,
  4.3BSD traceroute(8) forces at least two. This capability makes
  ctrace faster.
* 4.3BSD traceroute(8) emulation in most output, so it will hook in to
  existing parsers.
* The ability to skip an arbitrary number of hops, saving you time
  that would be normally wasted tracerouting your own network.
* Fine-grained control over trace packet headers, assisting in
  bypassing burdensome packet filters.
