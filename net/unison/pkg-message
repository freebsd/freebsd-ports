	ATTENTION:

1) Unison archive format has changed since 2.9.20. The old archive
won't be deleted automatically in case you want to downgrade it.

2) Merge functionality has seriously changed. Check the manual.

3) Together with gtk-enabled version, a text-only unison-text binary
is installed as it depends on a smaller number of libraries.
