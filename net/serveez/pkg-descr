Serveez is a server framework. It provides routines and help for implementing
IP based servers (currently TCP, UDP and ICMP). It is also possible to use
named pipes for all connection oriented protocols. We think it is worth the
effort because many people need server functionality within their applications.
However, many people experience problems with select()- or poll()-loops, and
with non-blocking operations. This application demonstrates various aspects of
advanced network programming in a portable manner. You can use it for
implementing your own servers or for understanding how certain network
services and operations work. The package includes a number of servers that
work already: an HTTP server, an IRC server, a Gnutella spider and some others.
One of the highlights is that you can run all protocols on the same port. The
application itself is single threaded but it uses helper processes for
concurrent name resolution and ident lookups.
