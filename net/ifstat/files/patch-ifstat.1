 Note that for this driver to work, ifstat needs to have read access to the system memory device. This is usually done by running it as root, or by installing setgid mem or kmem. ifstat will \s-1NOT\s0 install setgid by default; It is up to you to decide if you trust it.

-This driver gets statistics through \s-1SNMP\s0. The option, in the form [comm@][#]host[/nn]], specifies the host and eventual community to poll. Default community is public, but can be changed by prepending \*(L"comm@\*(R" to the hostname. If host starts by a #, interface names are generated from their index as `ifNN' (this is a workaround for some equipments that give all interfaces the same description). Default host is localhost, and this will be used by default if snmp is the only available driver.

 .Sp
 The driver will try to poll several interfaces at once by grouping requests in \s-1SNMP\s0 packets. By default interfaces will be polled by group of 8. If this doesn't work well with your equipments, you can lower that number by suffixing the hostname with /nn, where nn is the number of interfaces to poll at once. You can also increase the number if you want to poll a large number of interfaces efficiently and if your server supports it.
