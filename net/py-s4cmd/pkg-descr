S4cmd is a command-line utility for accessing S3 storage, inspired by
s3cmd.

It is intended as an alternative to s3cmd for enhanced performance and
for large files, and with a number of additional features and fixes for
data-intensive applications.

It strives to be compatible with the most common usage scenarios for
s3cmd. It does not offer exact drop-in compatibility, due to a number of
corner cases where different behavior seems preferable, or for bugfixes.

S4cmd supports the regular commands you might expect for fetching and
storing files in S3: ls, put, get, cp, mv, sync, del, du.
