This is a standalone version of W. Richard Stevens' "sock" program,
based on the code available for the UNIX Network Programming book.

Adapted and reworked code for W. Richard Stevens' "sock" utility
by Christian Kreibich.

From the author:  In TCP/IP Illustrated Vol. 1, Richard Stevens used
a program called "sock" to demonstrate the many properties of TCP/IP.
Unfortunately, the book only speaks about how to use the program but
does not point to a site for downloading its sources. While sock is
contained in the code package accompanying UNIX Network Programming,
this code is also getting dated.

The program can be used to generate TCP or UDP packets for testing
various network features.  It runs as either client or server.
