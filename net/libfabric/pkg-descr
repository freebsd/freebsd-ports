OpenFabrics Interfaces (OFI) is a framework focused on exporting fabric
communication services to applications. OFI is best described as a collection
of libraries and applications used to export fabric services. The key components
of OFI are: application interfaces, provider libraries, kernel services,
daemons, and test applications.

Libfabric is a core component of OFI. It is the library that defines and exports
the user-space API of OFI, and is typically the only software that applications
deal with directly. It works in conjunction with provider libraries, which are
often integrated directly into libfabric.
