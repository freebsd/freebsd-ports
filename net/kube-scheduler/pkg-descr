The Kubernetes scheduler is a control plane process which assigns Pods
to Nodes. The scheduler determines which Nodes are valid placements
for each Pod in the scheduling queue according to constraints and
available resources. The scheduler then ranks each valid Node and
binds the Pod to a suitable Node. Multiple different schedulers may
be used within a cluster; kube-scheduler is the reference implementation.
