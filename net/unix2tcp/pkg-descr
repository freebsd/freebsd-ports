Aims:
- To listen on a local UNIX socket and tunnel any incoming connections and 
  traffic to a (remote) IP address/port

What it does:
- Tunnels all traffic betweeb a (remote) address/port and a local UNIX socket
- Does NOT use fork() (single process model)
- Does use O_NONBLOCK , should be no case of blocking

What it doesnt do (yet):
- Doesnt limit number of concurent connections
