netaddr is a Python library for the manipulation of various common
network address notations and representations.

It takes the hassle out of fiddling with innumerable variations of
network addresses, presenting a consistent, extensible, easy-to-use
and (above all) Pythonic API.

With it you can validate, convert, categorise, iterate, generate,
slice (and dice):
    * IP version 4
    * IP version 6
    * CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
    * MAC (Media Access Control)
    * IEEE EUI-48 and EUI-64
