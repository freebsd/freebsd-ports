Wifibox deploys a Linux guest to drive a wireless networking card on
the FreeBSD host system with the help of PCI pass-through.  There have
been guides on the Internet to suggest the use of such techniques to
improve the wireless networking experience on FreeBSD, of which
Wifibox tries to implement as a single easy-to-use software package.
