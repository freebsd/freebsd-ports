===============================================================================

In order for wireshark be able to capture packets when used by unprivileged
user, /dev/bpf should be in network group and have read-write permissions.
For example:

# chgrp network /dev/bpf*
# chmod g+r /dev/bpf*
# chmod g+w /dev/bpf*

In order for this to persist across reboots, add the following to
/etc/devfs.conf:

own  bpf* root:network
perm bpf* 0660
