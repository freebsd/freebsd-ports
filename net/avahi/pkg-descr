Service discovery on a local network -- this means that you can plug your
laptop or computer into a network and instantly be able to view other people
who you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files being shared.
This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X (branded 'Rendezvous',
'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf') and is very convenient.
