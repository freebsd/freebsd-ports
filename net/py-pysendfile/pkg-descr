sendfile(2) is a system call which provides a "zero-copy" way of copying data
from one file descriptor to another (a socket). The phrase "zero-copy" refers
to the fact that all of the copying of data between the two descriptors is
done entirely by the kernel, with no copying of data into userspace buffers.
