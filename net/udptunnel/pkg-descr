UDPTunnel by Jonathan Lennox; copyright 1999,2001 by Columbia University.

UDPTunnel is a small program which can tunnel UDP packets bi-directionally
over a TCP connection.  Its primary purpose (and original motivation) is to
allow multi-media conferences to traverse a firewall which allows only
outgoing TCP connections.
