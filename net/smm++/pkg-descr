SMM++ is a MUD client with mapping functionality. You can just use
mapping or just mudding or both together.

It is based on itcl , which itself depends on tcl/tk . itcl, tcl/tk
are free and standart programming languages. (If you need further
information, where to get itcl and/or tcl/tk, please drop me a
line.)
