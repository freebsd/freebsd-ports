txrestapi makes it easier to create Twisted REST API services. Normally,
one would create Resource subclasses defining each segment of a path;
this is cubersome to implement and results in output that isn't very
readable. txrestapi provides an APIResource class allowing complex
mapping of path to callback (a la Django) with a readable decorator.
