This package sends wake-on-lan packets to turn on machines
that are wake-on-lan capable.

For now there is only one function in this package:

Net::Wake::by_udp(host, mac_address, [port]);

You can power on PCs by
perl -e 'use Net::Wake; Net::Wake::by_udp("192.168.0.1", "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx");'

You can also specify broadcast address for `host'. It is useful in a
intelligent network.
