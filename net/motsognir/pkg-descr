Motsognir is a robust, reliable and easy to install open-source gopher server 
for Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD, and anything else POSIX-compliant).

The Motsognir gopher server is meant to be used for small projects (like home 
servers), but should scale well on bigger architectures as well. All the 
configuration is done via a single configuration file, which has very 
reasonable defaults. That makes Motsognir easily maintainable, and allows the 
administrator to have a full knowledge of what features are allowed/enabled on 
the server. Motsognir supports server-side CGI applications and PHP scripts, is 
plainly compatible with UTF-8 filesystems, and is entirely written in ANSI C 
without external dependencies.
