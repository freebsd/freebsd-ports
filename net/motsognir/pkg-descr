Motsognir is a robust, reliable and easy to install open-source gopher server
for Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD, and anything else POSIX-compliant).

The Motsognir gopher server is meant to be used for small projects (like home
servers), but should scale well on bigger architectures as well. All the
configuration is done via a single configuration file, which has very
reasonable defaults. That makes Motsognir easily maintainable, and allows the
administrator to have a full knowledge of what features are allowed/enabled on
the server. Motsognir supports server-side CGI applications and PHP scripts, is
plainly compatible with UTF-8 filesystems, and is entirely written in ANSI C
without external dependencies.
