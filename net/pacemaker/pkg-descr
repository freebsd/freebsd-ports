Pacemaker is an advanced, scalable High-Availability cluster resource manager
for Linux-HA (Heartbeat) and/or Corosync.

It supports "n-node" clusters with significant capabilities for managing
resources and dependencies.

It will run scripts at initialization, when machines go up or down, when
related resources fail and can be configured to periodically check resource
health.
