A light-weight DHCP Relay Agent.

Why not the ISC DHCP Relay Agent?

- If your RA has multiple interfaces, you get multiple requests for
  each request:

  DHCPREQUEST for 10.199.14.216 from 00:10:dc:d1:e6:39 (foo) via 10.199.14.1
  DHCPACK on 10.199.14.216 to 00:10:dc:d1:e6:39 (foo) via 10.199.14.1
  DHCPREQUEST for 10.199.14.216 from 00:10:dc:d1:e6:39 (foo) via 10.10.3.5: wrong network.
  DHCPNAK on 10.199.14.216 to 00:10:dc:d1:e6:39 via 10.10.3.5

  This RA sends only one request, coming with the IP address of the
  LAN the request came from.

- If your RA has multiple interfaces, the outgoing interfaces to
  the WAN needs to be active in the DHCP relay otherwise answers
  are not picked up.

  This RA uses a unicast socket for returning answers.

- If your RA has non-ethernet interfaces (GIF-tunnels for example,
  which VPN back to the central network), the answers are not picked
  up by the RA.
