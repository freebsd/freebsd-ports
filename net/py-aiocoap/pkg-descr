The aiocoap package is an implementation of CoAP, the Constrained Application
Protocol. It facilitates writing applications that talk to network enabled
embedded ("IoT" / "Internet of Things") devices.

It is written in Python 3 using its native asyncio methods to facilitate
concurrent operations while maintaining an easy to use interface.
