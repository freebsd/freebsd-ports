GNUnet is an anonymous, distributed, reputation-based network. A first
service implemented on top of the networking layer allows censorship-
resistant file-sharing.

Our goal is to provide an infrastructure for secure networking. All
communication in GNUnet is authenticated and encrypted. The reputation
model makes attacks on the network harder. GNUnet does not rely on any
centralized services.

While our goals are similar to projects like Freenet, Gnutella, MojoNation
and others, we hope to provide a superior combination of features for users
that value security more than efficiency.
