************************************************************************

NTP Analyzer has been installed. If this is the first time remember to
create a MariaDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL user and database first.

If you are upgrading from a previous version of NTP Analyzer be sure to
take a backup of your database before starting ntpa in upgrade mode.

************************************************************************

The ntpa newsyslog.conf(5) filename has been changed:
  OLD: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/ntpa
  NEW: ${PREFIX}/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/ntpa.conf

Any file found at the old location has been automatically moved to
the new location. This was done to ensure log rotation continued to
work after change r340318 made to FreeBSD base, where the default
newsyslog configuration now only includes filenames that end with
'.conf' and do not begin with '.'.

If you use provisioning/configuration management tools to create or
edit this file, you will need to change their configuration to use
the new filename.
