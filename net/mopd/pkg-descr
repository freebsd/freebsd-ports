The MOP Loader Daemon is for use netbooting older DEC machines such as VAXen
and DECstations.  Some versions of SRM on DEC Alphas might support it too.
MOP is functionally comparable to TFTP.

Included in this package are the `mopd' daemon itself, plus the debugging
utilities `mopchk', `mopprobe', and `moptrace'.
