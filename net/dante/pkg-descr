Dante is a circuit-level firewall/proxy (socks implemented) that can be
used to provide convenient and secure network connectivity to a wide range
of hosts while requiring only the server Dante runs on to have external
network connectivity.

Once installed, Dante can in most cases be made transparent to the clients
while offering detailed access control and logging facilities to the
server administrator.
