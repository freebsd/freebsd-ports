uvgRTP is an Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) library written in C++
with a focus on simple to use and high-efficiency media delivery over the
Internet.  It features an intuitive and easy-to-use API, built-in support
for transporting Versatile Video Coding (VVC), High Efficiency Video
Coding (HEVC), Advanced Video Coding (AVC) encoded video and Opus encoded
audio.  Furthermore, uvgRTP can be used to transport Visual Volumetric
Video-based Coding (V3C) encoded volumetric video.  uvgRTP also supports
End-to-End Encrypted (E2EE) media delivery using the combination of
Secure RTP (SRTP) and ZRTP.  uvgRTP has been designed to minimize memory
operations to reduce its CPU usage and latency.
