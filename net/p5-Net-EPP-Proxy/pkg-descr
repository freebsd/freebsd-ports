EPP is the Extensible Provisioning Protocol. EPP (defined in RFC 3730) is
an application layer client-server protocol for the provisioning and
management of objects stored in a shared central repository. Specified in
XML, the protocol defines generic object management operations and an
extensible framework that maps protocol operations to objects. As of
writing, its only well-developed application is the provisioning of
Internet domain names, hosts, and related contact details.

RFC 3734 defines a TCP based transport model for EPP, and this module
implements a proxy server for this model. You can use it to construct a
daemon that maintains a single connection to the EPP server that can be
used by many local clients, thereby reducing the overhead for each
transaction.

Net::EPP::Proxy is based on the Net::Server framework and
Net::EPP::Client, which it uses to communicate with the server.
