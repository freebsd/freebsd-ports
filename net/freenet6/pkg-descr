What is Freenet6?

Freenet6 is an IPv6 access service offered for free to the community.
This service enables thousands of people from all over the world
to experience the best solution for a smooth and incremental
deployment of IPv6. Freenet6 users can get IPv6 connectivity from
anywhere, including from behind any NAT device or from outside of
their home network.

On Freenet6, a single, permanent IPv6 address and a DNS name are
assigned to each user, making their PC reachable from anywhere on
the IPv6 internet. A full /48 prefix may also be assigned to a
router, enabling the distribution of IPv6 connectivity to an entire
network.  Freenet 6 - Get Connected For Free!

Instead of a Web interface, which is usually offered by traditional
tunnel brokers, Freenet6 uses an innovative model based on a
client/server architecture. The Gateway6 Client is software that
usually runs on a PC and that implements the Tunnel Setup Protocol
(TSP). The Gateway6 Client is used to automatically negotiate a
configured tunnel between a PC or router and the Freenet6 tunnel
broker, making IPv6 easy to install and maintain. The Gateway6
Client source code is licensed under the GPL. A commercial license
is also available.
