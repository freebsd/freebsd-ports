Now that the package is installed, please finish it with the following steps:

- Copy @@EXAMPLESDIR@@/tspc.conf.sample to @@PREFIX@@/etc/tspc.conf
- Check the values of @@PREFIX@@/etc/tspc.conf. If you have registered at
  the website, fill in your userid and password there.
- Run @@PREFIX@@/etc/rc.d/freenet6.sh to start the tunnel.
- Try to ping a IPv6 host, for example: ping6 www.jp.freebsd.org

Please note that tsps[12].freenet6.net are not in service anymore,
please use broker.freenet6.net instead.

Net/freenet6 now supports rc.subr.
Please add 'freenet6_enable="YES"' to your /etc/rc.conf to make it
start autoamtically at startup.
