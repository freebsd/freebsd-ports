SendSNPP is a perl program for sending messages through a RFC1861 compliant
SNPP server. SNPP stands for Simple Network Paging Protocol. It is used by a
wide range of paging providers for sending pages. A list of some of the
providers that support the SNPP service is on the WWW site below. SendSNPP
requires no special modules, and has been tested on Linux and Windows systems.
It has a very straight forward interface making it very easy to use.

- Supports logging to a file
- Script returns error status to the system when an error occurs
- Automatic message truncation when message exceeds providers limit
- Verbose and descriptive error messages if something goes wrong
