WIDE-DHCPv6 is an open-source implementation of Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), originally developed
by the KAME project.

The implementation mainly conforms to the following standards:

- RFC3315: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
- RFC3319: DHCPv6 Options for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers
- RFC3633: IPv6 Prefix Options for DHCP
- RFC3646: DNS Configuration options for DHCPv6
- RFC3898: Network Information Service (NIS) Configuration Options for DHCPv6
- RFC4075: Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Configuration Option for DHCPv6
- RFC4242: Information Refresh Time Option for DHCPv6
- RFC4280: DHCP Options for Broadcast and Multicast Control Servers

Note that the current implementation does not support temporary
IPv6 address allocation by DHCPv6, and there is no plan to
implement that feature at the moment.
