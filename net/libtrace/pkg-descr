libtrace is a library for capturing and processing network traffic, similar to
libpcap. Libtrace supports multiple trace formats for both input and output
including live device capture, DAG hardware capture and off-line trace files
(both compressed and uncompressed).

More information about libtrace can be found on the libtrace webpage.
