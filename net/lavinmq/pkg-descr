LavinMQ is a message queue server, also called a message broker, compatible
with the AMQP0.9 spec, where messages are published by a sending service called
a producer, via the broker, to then be consumed by the receiving service called
a consumer. When not handling messages, the queue can route, buffer, and
persist the messages according to rules set up by the user.

Messages can be sent across languages, platforms, and OS, which decouple
processes and creates a highly scalable system. lavinmq, as queue management
software, gives an organized, safe place for messages to wait until another
application or part of the system can come along and consume them for
processing.

lavinmq is written in Crystal, a statically compiled LLVM-based
language with a ruby-like syntax.
