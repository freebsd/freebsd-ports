The
.Nm
is an implementation of Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) server.

re-configuring existent DHCP server.

listens on two well-known ports (67/udp and 68/udp) so the root
privilege is needed to run.

.Pp
Specify nework interface name
.Pq Li eth0 for example, on Linux
to

If the network interface has more than one IP address,
use
.Fl l ,
.Fl t ,
.Fl b
options.
.Fl i
or
.Po Fl l ,

and
.Fl b
option

is required.
.Pp
