Net::SDP is an SDP (Session Description Protocol) parser and generator.
Net::SDP is object oriented and a single instance of Net::SDP represents
a single SDP session description.  There are methods to easily get, set
and create each of the fields in the session description.

The classes Net::SDP::Time and Net::SDP::Media are automatically
instantiated for each Time Description (t=) and Media Description (m=).
