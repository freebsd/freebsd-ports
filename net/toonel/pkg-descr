Toonel.net exploits a tunneling technique combined with data compression.
It runs compressed data frames from toonel client to one of the toonel
servers and then these are forwarded to the target host. Reducing the
size of resources that are transferred between the server and the client
makes more efficient use of the user's bandwidth.
