  message: <<EOM
A default configuration file has been installed in
%%ETCDIR%%/fort-config.json.sample.

To use FORT, you will need the Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) files.
You can download these by running "fort --init-tals" as follows:

# fort --init-tals --tal %%ETCDIR%%/tal

When you have downloaded the TAL files, you can start the RTR
server and validator:

# sysrc fort_enable=YES # or edit /etc/rc.conf manually
# service fort start

The default configuration will bind the RTR server to localhost
on port 8323.

Consult the FORT manual for more information:
