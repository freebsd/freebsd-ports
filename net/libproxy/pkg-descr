Libproxy exists to answer the question: Given a network resource, how do I
reach it?  It handles all the details, enabling you to get back to
programming.

GNOME? KDE? Command line? WPAD? PAC? Network changed? It doesn't matter!
Just ask libproxy what proxy to use: you get simple code and your users
get correct, consistant behavior and broad infrastructure compatibility.
