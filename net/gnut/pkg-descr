Gnut is a text-mode client for the Gnutella distributed network. Gnutella
is a global file-sharing network similar in many ways to Napster, except
it has a truly distributed design which does not rely on centralized
servers. Additionally, all types of file may be shared via gnutella, not
just MP3 audio files as with Napster.

When you connect to the Gnutella network, your local machine becomes
a server as well as a client on the network and will start receiving
queries and traffic from other hosts. This imposes a moderate bandwidth
penalty on usage, but the impact can be configured.

Users should be aware that Gnutella does not attempt to provide
anonymity or confidentiality of search requests or transfers, so use for
illegal purposes is not recommended.
