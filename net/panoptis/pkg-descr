Panoptis is a project started some time ago,
with the aim to stop the Denial of Service
and Distributed Denial of Service attacks that
have been torturing the Internet for the last
few years.
It is based on real-time processing of Cisco (R)
NetFlow (TM) data, since this seems to be the
most efficient approach as it is router-centric,
allowing for automated central response without
intervention from the affected organizations'
network administrators.
