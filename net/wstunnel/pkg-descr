Most of the time when you are using a public network, you are behind some kind
of firewall or proxy. One of their purpose is to constrain you to only use
certain kind of protocols and consult only a subset of the web. Nowadays, the
most widespread protocol is http and it is de facto allowed by third party
equipment.

Wstunnel uses the websocket protocol which is compatible with http in order to
bypass firewalls and proxies. Wstunnel allows you to tunnel whatever traffic
you want and access whatever resources/site you need.
