QTorrent is a BitTorrent client that uses the Qt widget-set. It allows you to 
have several torrents open at the same time from within the same program 
window, offering you easy overview, access and management through a list-mode.
Every torrent also has it's own page where you can control things like upload 
speed and upload slots. A page that shows some statistics of all open torrents 
is also available.
