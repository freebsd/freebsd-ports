SocketW is a cross platform (Linux/FreeBSD/Unix/Win32) streaming socket C++
library designed to be easy to use. It supports Unix sockets and TCP/IP sockets
with optional SSL/TLS (OpenSSL) support. SocketW allows you to write portable
and secure network applications quickly without needing to spend time learning
low-level system functions or reading OpenSSL manuals.
