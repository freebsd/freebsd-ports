HAProxyctl is a tool to manage the various aspects of HAProxy that can be
controlled by means of its socket.

HAProxyctl can be used in 2 modes. CLI mode and Python API mode. CLI mode,
as the name implies, gives you a command, haproxyctl, that can be used to
control HAProxy. You can use the Python API mode to integrate HAProxyctl
directly in your Python project.
