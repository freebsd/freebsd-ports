The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) assigns an
Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI) to manufacturers of network
interfaces. Each interface has a Media Access Control (MAC) address of six
bytes. The first three bytes are the OUI.

This module allows you to take a MAC address and turn it into the OUI and
vendor information. You can, for instance, scan a network, collect MAC
addresses, and turn those addresses into vendors. With vendor information,
you can often guess at what you are looking at (e.g. an Apple
product).

You can use this as a module as its individual functions, or call it as a
script with a list of MAC addresses as arguments. The module can figure it
out.

This module tries to persistently cache with DBM::Deep the OUI information
so it can avoid using the network. If it cannot load DBM::Deep, it uses a
normal hash (which is lost when the process finishes). You can preload
this cache with the load_cache() function. So far, the module looks in the
current working directory for a file named mac_oui.db to find the cache. I
need to come up with a way to let the user set that location.
