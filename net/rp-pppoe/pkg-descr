PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) is a protocol used
by many ADSL service providers. Roaring Penguin's PPPoE software
is a reliable program for connecting unix systems to PPPoE service
providers without requiring any kernel patches.

Note that this port has had little testing (it works on 5-CURRENT
to access T-Online in Germany from the client side) and the server side
is entirely untested.
