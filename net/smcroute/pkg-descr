SMCRoute is a command line tool to manipulate the multicast routes of a
UNIX kernel.  It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast routing.

SMCRoute can be used as an alternative to dynamic multicast routers like
mrouted or pimd in setups where static multicast routes should be
maintained and/or no proper IGMP or MLD signaling exists.
