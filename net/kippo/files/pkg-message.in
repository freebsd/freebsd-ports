kippo has been installed in the following directory:

	%%DATADIR%%

Before starting kippo you need to perform the following steps:

1) Edit kippo's configuration file to suit your needs:

	$EDITOR %%DATADIR%%/kippo.cfg

   Please keep in mind when editing the configuration file that kippo
   can't be run as root and is started by the 'kippo' unprivileged
   user instead. This implies that the following folders hierarchy
   must be created and made writable to the 'kippo' user:

	dl/
	data/
	log/tty/

2) Add the following line to your rc.conf:

	kippo_enable="YES"

   Note that you can also set the 'kippo_logfile' and 'kippo_pidfile'
   variables to specify the path to the log file and pid file that
   will be used by kippo. The default values for those variables are
   '/tmp/kippo.log' and '/tmp/kippo.pid' respectively.

Then you can start kippo by issuing the following command:

	service kippo start
