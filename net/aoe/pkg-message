Please remember to reinstall this port after kernel source update.  Using AoE
devices on boot is a little tricky because the network must be up before the
system can access an AoE device. The current rc boot method for automounting
filesystems will not work with AoE devices; vinum and mount -a are both run
before bringing up the network.

In order to use AoE devices on boot a few rc.conf variables have been defined
that permit the boot script (/etc/rc.d/aoe) to initialize systems using AoE
devices after the network is up. They are as follows:

   aoe_enable    Set to "Yes" to enable the aoe startup script.
   aoe_iflist    A space separated string of interfaces valid for AoE.
   aoe_wc        Set to "1" to enable write cache on AoE device.
   aoe_mounts    A space seperated string of AoE device nodes to be mounted.
                 (An entry for each needs to be in /etc/fstab as well with the
                  "noauto" option.)

For example, the following added to /etc/rc.conf:

   aoe_enable="Yes"
   aoe_iflist="em0 em1"
   aoe_wc="1"
   aoe_mounts="/dev/aoed0s1a /dev/aoed1s1a"

and the following added to /etc/fstab:

  # Device                Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
  /dev/aoed0s1a           /mnt/a          ufs     rw,noauto       0       0
  /dev/aoed1s1a           /mnt/b          ufs     rw,noauto       0       0

will automatically start the AoE driver and mount the /mnt/a and /mnt/b
"blades".  See aoe(4) and http://www.coraid.com/support/freebsd/usingaoe.html
for more information.
