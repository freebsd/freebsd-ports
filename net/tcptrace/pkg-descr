tcptrace is a TCP connection analysis tool. It can tell you detailed
information about TCP connections by sifting through dump files.
The dump file formats supported are:
   Standard tcpdump format (you need the pcap library)
   Sun's snoop format
   Macintosh Etherpeek format
   HP/NetMetrix protocol analysis format
   NS simulator output format
   NetScout
   NLANR Tsh Format

To see the graphs, you'll also need Tim Shepard's xplot program,
