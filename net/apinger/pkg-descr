Alarm Pinger (apinger) is a little tool which monitors various IP 
devices by simple ICMP echo requests. Unlike most Perl or shell 
script tools, it does not spawn processes or use much CPU time, 
and is ideal for when one wants continuous monitoring and fast 
response upon target failure. It is written in C and supports both 
IPv4 and IPv6.
