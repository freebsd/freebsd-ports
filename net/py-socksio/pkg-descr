Client-side sans-I/O SOCKS proxy implementation. Supports SOCKS4, SOCKS4A, and
SOCKS5.

socksio is a sans-I/O library similar to h11 or h2, this means the library
itself does not handle the actual sending of the bytes through the network, it
only deals with the implementation details of the SOCKS protocols so you can use
it in any I/O library you want.
