Disco is a passive IP discovery and fingerprinting utility
designed to sit on segments distributed throughout a network to
discover unique IP's on the network. In addition to IP
discovery disco has the ability to passively fingerprint TCP
SYN packets. The intention is for disco to discover IP's on the
network, fingerprint the packet if necessary, and load into the
Gherkin Scan Manager database for targeted host scans.
