Flower is a label-based networking daemon.

CloudABI applications are not permitted to call bind or connect on
sockets directly, as that would conflict with CloudABI's security model.
Instead, they can send RPCs to fulfill such requests to a separate
daemon, called Flower.

Like CloudABI, Flower makes use of a capability-based security model.
This makes it easy to spawn applications in such a way that they can
only have a limited view of the network, without requiring separate
users or complex access control policies.
