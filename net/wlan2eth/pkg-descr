A simple tool to convert packet captures in 802.11 format to Ethernet format.
Lots of tools can only understand Ethernet link types, so I wrote this
tool to convert captures to a format that they can understand.
Note that this tool is really only useful for encrypted traffic.

Specify a wireless packet capture as an input file, and the name of the
desired Ethernet-format output file. Wlan2eth will only convert data frames
to the output file, which will likely result in a significantly smaller output
packet capture file. Note that wlan2eth will only convert unencrypted frames.
