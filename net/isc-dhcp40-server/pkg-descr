that are new since version 2.0:

  * DHCP Failover Protocol support
  * OMAPI, an API for accessing and modifying the DHCP server and client state
  * Conditional behaviour
  * Storing arbitrary information on leases
  * Address pools with access control
  * Client classing
  * Address allocation restriction by class
  * Relay agent information option support 
  * Dynamic DNS updates
  * Many bug fixes, performance enhancements, and minor new DHCP protocol
    features.
