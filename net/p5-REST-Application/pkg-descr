This module acts as a base class for applications which implement a
RESTful interface. When an HTTP request is received some dispatching logic
in REST::Application is invoked, calling different handlers based on what
the kind of HTTP request it was (i.e. GET, PUT, etc) and what resource it
was trying to access. This module won't ensure that your API is RESTful
but hopefully it will aid in developing a REST API.
