mdns-repeater is a Multicast DNS repeater. Multicast DNS uses the 224.0.0.51
address, which is "administratively scoped" and does not leave the subnet.

This program re-broadcast mDNS packets from one interface to other interfaces.

It can be used to bridge zeroconf devices to work properly across the two
subnets.
