Net::DHCP::Watch is a module to help monitor remote DHCP servers.
It opens an udp socket to send and receive responses to and from
a DHCP server. It stores the last connection status information.

This module can help to write some simple code to implement a
reliable DHCP service over complex or simple networks.
