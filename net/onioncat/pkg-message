If you plan to also receive connections (e.g. because you provide a service or
you use software which opens sockets for incomming connections like Bitorrent)
you MUST the onioncat_hostname in rc.conf and configure the following hidden
service in torrc:

HiddenServicePort 8060 127.0.0.1:8060

Finally, please consider setting up an IPv6 firewall.
