OnionCat is a VPN-adapter which allows to connect two or more computers or
networks through VPN-tunnels. It is designed to use the anonymization networks
Tor or I2P as its transport, hence, it provides location-based anonymity while
still creating tunnel end points with private unique IP addresses.

OnionCat uses IPv6 as native layer 3 network protocol. The clients
connected by it appear as on a single logical IPv6 network as being connected
by a virtual switch. OnionCat automatically calculates and assigns unique IPv6
addresses to the tunnel end points which are derived from the hidden service
ID (onion ID) of the hidden service of the local Tor client, or the local I2P
server destination, respectively. This technique provides authentication
between the onion ID and the layer 3 address, hence, defeats IP spoofing
within the OnionCat VPN.

If necessary, OnionCat can of course transport IPv4 as well. Although it has
native IP support, the suggested way to do this is to configure an
IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.
