The Internet Gopher is a distributed document delivery service. It
allows a neophyte user to access various types of data residing on
multiple hosts in a seamless fashion. This is accomplished by
presenting the user a hierarchical arrangement of documents and by
using a client-server communications model. The Internet Gopher
Server accepts simple queries, and responds by sending the client
a document.
