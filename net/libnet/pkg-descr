Libnet is an API to help with the construction and injection of network packets.
It provides a portable framework for low-level network packet writing and
handling (use libnet in conjunction with libpcap and you can write some really
cool stuff). Libnet includes packet creation at the IP layer and at the link
layer as well as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality.
