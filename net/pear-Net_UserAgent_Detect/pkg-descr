The Net_UserAgent object does a number of tests on an HTTP user
agent string. The results of these tests are available via methods of
the object.

This module is based upon the JavaScript browser detection code available
at http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/sniffer/browser_type.html.
This module had many influences from the lib/Browser.php code in
version 1.3 of Horde.
