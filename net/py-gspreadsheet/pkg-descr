gspreadsheet is a wrapper around a wrapper to get Google spreadsheets to look
like csv.DictReader.  If you're used to working with CSVs or a human, you'll
find that working with Google's Python API for spreadsheets is so frustrating.
With gspreadsheet, you can adapt your existing csv code to work with Google
Spreadsheets with just two line changes. As an added bonus, if you alter the
dict, those changes get saved back to the original spreadsheet.
