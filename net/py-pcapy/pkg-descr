Pcapy is a Python extension module that interfaces with the libpcap packet
capture library. Pcapy enables Python scripts to capture packets on the network.

Pcapy is highly effective when used in conjunction with a packet-handling
package such as Impacket, which is a collection of Python classes for
constructing and dissecting network packets.
