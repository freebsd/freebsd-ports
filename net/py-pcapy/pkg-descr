Pcapy is a Python extension module that interfaces with
the libpcap packet capture library. Pcapy enables Python
scripts to capture packets on the network.

Pcapy is highly effective when used in conjunction with
a packet-handling package such as Impacket, which is a
collection of Python classes for constructing and dissecting
network packets.
