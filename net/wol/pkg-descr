wol implements Wake-On-LAN functionality in a small program. 
It wakes up hardware that is Magic Packet compliant.

Consider you have a sleeping or turned-off computer 
and you want to wake it up remotely. Just type:

  # wol <MAC-ADDRESS>
  
and the host wakes up (OK, it will boot ;-). 

Features:
- Wakes up various NIC's (tested)
  - 3COM 3C905c
  - Intel EtherExpress Pro 100
  - Linksys Etherfast LNE100TX
  - Realtek LFE8139
  - LevelOne FNC-0107TX
- Wake up from file (same as /etc/ethers and an enhanced format)
- Sleeping between two wake ups (measured in milliseconds)
