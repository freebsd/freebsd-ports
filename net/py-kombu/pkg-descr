Kombu is an AMQP messaging framework for Python.

The aim of Kombu is to make messaging in Python as easy as
possible by providing an idiomatic high-level interface for
the AMQP protocol, and also provide proven and tested solutions
to common messaging problems.

Features:

    * Allows application authors to support several message
      server solutions by using pluggable transports.
    * Supports automatic encoding, serialization and compression
      of message payloads.
    * Consistent exception handling across transports.
    * The ability to ensure that an operation is performed by
      gracefully handling connection and channel errrors.
    * Several annoyances with amqplib has been fixed, like
      supporting timeouts and the ability to wait for events on
      more than one channel.
