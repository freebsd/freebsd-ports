XtRadius is a freeware radius server implementation. The main feature is that it
can handle user accounting and authentication informations via external fully
configurable scripts.
The XtRadius server is based on Cistron Radius 1.6.3. You can write script to
make you own auth and/or accounting routines without having to patch the main
server.
