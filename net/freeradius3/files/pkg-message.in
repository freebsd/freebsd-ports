To enable FreeRADIUS, put the following line in /etc/rc.conf

radiusd_enable="YES"


The sample configuration can be found at
%%EXAMPLESDIR%%/raddb

If you are upgrading FreeRADIUS, you are advised to use this as a reference
for updating your configuration.


FreeRADIUS will look for its configuration directory at
%%PREFIX%%/etc/raddb by default.

If you did not already have a configuration at this location, the sample
configuration has been copied to this location and has been bootstrapped.


If you wish to point FreeRADIUS to a configuration at a different
location, put the following line in /etc/rc.conf

radiusd_flags="-d /path/to/raddb"


To start the server in normal (daemon) mode, run:

%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/radiusd start

and to stop the server, run:

%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/radiusd stop


To start the server in debugging mode, run:

%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/radiusd debug


You are advised to make cautious changes to the configuration, and to test
frequently, using debugging mode where necessary. Try to resist the
temptation to disable or delete things that you don't understand - you may
well break things!
