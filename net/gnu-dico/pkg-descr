GNU Dico is a flexible modular implementation of DICT server (RFC 2229).
It handles database accesses using loadable modules, and does not depend
on particular database format. The package includes several loadable
modules for interfacing with various database formats, among them a
module for dict.org databases. New modules can be written in C, Guile or
Python. The package also includes a console client program for querying
remote dictionary servers.
