This module implements remote procedure call. I've tried to keep
things simple.

So this module should be :
- quite simple to use (thanks to autoload mechanisms)
- lightweight

It sure is not :
- DCE
- CORBA
- bulletproof
- securityproof
- foolproof

But it works. (Although I'm opened to suggestion regarding the
"un-proof" areas)
