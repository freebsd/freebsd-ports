Net::Frame is a fork of Net::Packet. The goal here was to greatly
simplify the use of the frame crafting framework. Net::Packet does
many things undercover, and it was difficult to document all the thingies.

Also, Net::Packet may suffer from unease of use, because frames were
assembled using layers stored in L2, L3, L4 and L7 attributes. Net::Frame
removes all this, and is splitted in different modules, for those who only
want to use part of the framework, and not whole framework.

Finally, anyone can create a layer, and put it on his CPAN space, because
of the modularity Net::Frame offers. For an example,
see Net::Frame::Layer::ICMPv4 on my CPAN space.
