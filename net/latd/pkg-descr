The linux-decnet project is an effort to bring full DECnet
support to Linux; however, they also separately offer the latd
package, a collection of programs that speak Digital's old Local
Area Terminal (LAT) protocol.  These programs enable network
clients to reach serial devices connected to old LAT-only
terminal servers, such as the DECserver 200/MC.

This is a redistribution of the linux-decnet project's software,
with FreeBSD compatibility added. It is based very closely on the
NetBSD port by Matt Fredette and has benefited from the
wonderful assistance of Patrick Caulfield (the original author).
