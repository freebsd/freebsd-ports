FRR's OSPF daemons tries to allocate big socket buffer, so generate warning
messages like:
"setsockopt_so_sendbuf: fd 6: SO_SNDBUF set to 1048576 (requested 8388608)"
To prevent such message kern.ipc.maxsockbuf can be increased:
sysctl kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=16777216

Error messages like "if_ioctl(SIOCGIFMEDIA) failed: Invalid argument" are
under investigation but seems harmless.
