The kernel library was written to solve the technical problems encountered
when writing a DGD mudlib for users who will have programming access.  It deals
with resource control, file security and user management, and offers basic
functionality in the form of events.  The library is designed to be fully
configurable, and should not have to be modified for use on any system.  It
can be used for both persistent and non-persistent systems.
