Python library that provides SOCKS proxy support for aiohttp, supporting
SOCKS4(a), SOCKS5(h), and HTTP tunneling proxies. It allows for proxy
chaining and integrates with aiohttp to facilitate secure and anonymous
web requests. The library uses python-socks for core proxy functionality
and aims to maintain compatibility with new aiohttp versions by
providing a single point of integration.
