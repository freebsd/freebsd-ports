A Net::Proxy object represents a proxy that accepts connections and then
relays the data transfered between the source and the destination.
The goal of this module is to abstract the different methods used to
connect from the proxy to the destination.
A proxy is a program that transfer data across a network boundary
between a client and a server. Net::Proxy introduces the concept of
"connectors" (implemented as Net::Proxy::Connector subclasses), which
abstract the server part (connected to the client) and the client part
(connected to the server) of the proxy.
This architecture makes it easy to implement specific techniques to
cross a given network boundary, possibly by using a proxy on one side of
the network fence, and a reverse-proxy on the other side of the fence.
