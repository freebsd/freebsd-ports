This is inspired by Julien Schmidt's httprouter, in that it uses a patricia
tree, but the implementation is rather different. Specifically, the routing
rules are relaxed so that a single path segment may be a wildcard in one route
and a static token in another. This gives a nice combination of high
performance with a lot of convenience in designing the routing patterns. In
benchmarks, httptreemux is close to, but slightly slower than, httprouter.
