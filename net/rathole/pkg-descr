rathole is a high-performance reverse proxy for NAT traversal.

Features:
* High Performance: much higher throughput can be achieved than frp, and more
  stable when handling a large volume of connections.
* Low Resource Consumption: Consumes much fewer memory than similar tools.
* Security: Tokens of services are mandatory and service-wise. The server and
  clients are responsible for their own configs. With the optional Noise
  Protocol, encryption can be configured at ease. No need to create a
  self-signed certificate. TLS is also supported.
* Hot Reload: Services can be added or removed dynamically by hot-reloading the
  configuration file. HTTP API is WIP.
