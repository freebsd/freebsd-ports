This library provides simple read-only access to the local computer's
networking configuration.  It is currently capable of getting a list of
all the network interfaces and their respective IPv4, IPv6 and MAC
addresses.  network-info has been tested and is known to work on Ubuntu
10.10, FreeBSD 9.0, Mac OS X 10.6.4 and Windows XP/7.  It probably works
on other flavours of Linux, OS X, FreeBSD and Windows as well.
