Xrdesktop2 is a GTK2-Perl frontend for Rdesktop, which allows for the
saving, and editing of session configurations.

Xrdesktop2's intent is to handle Rdesktop's available commandline options,
by presenting them in a [Perl/GTK2] GUI. Xrdesktop2 currently handles most
any of the options you're likely to be interested in. Future versions will
undoubtedly add more.
