3[APA3A] tiny proxy 3Proxy (pronounce it as "Zaraza tiny proxy") is really
tiny cross-platform (Win32&Unix) proxy servers set. It includes HTTP proxy
with HTTPS and FTP support, SOCKSv4/SOCKSv4.5/SOCKSv5 proxy, POP3 proxy,
TCP and UDP portmappers. You can use every proxy as a standalone program
(socks, proxy, tcppm, udppm, pop3p) or use combined program (3proxy).
Combined proxy additionally supports features like access control,
bandwidth limiting, limiting daily/weekly/monthly traffic amount, proxy
chaining, log rotation, sylog and ODBC logging, etc. It's created to be
small, simple (I'd like to say secure - but it's just a beta) and yet
functional. It may be compiled with Visual C or gcc. Native Win32 version
included in archive and supports installation as NT/2K/XP service.
Currently 3proxy is tested to work under Windows 98/NT/2000/2003/XP,
FreeBSD/i386, Linux/i386, Linux/Alpha. See Release Notes and Changes for
features list.
3proxy is FreeWare. It can be used under terms of GNU/GPL or under it own
license (please read License Agreement).
