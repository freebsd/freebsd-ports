From the README:
    The IO::Socket::Multicast module subclasses IO::Socket::INET to enable
    you to manipulate multicast groups. With this module (and an operating
    system that supports multicasting), you will be able to receive incoming
    multicast transmissions and generate your own outgoing multicast
    packets.
