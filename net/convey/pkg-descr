Convey allows people across the globe to collaboratively draw images while
chatting online. Using pictures in addition to words makes communicating online
fun and easy.

Convey is an Instant Message (IM) program. You can send an message to a friend,
but unlike email, the message instantly appears on your friend's screen if they
are online. Otherwise, the message is delivered to your friend when they log
onto the Internet.

Convey uses the Jabber protocol to send its messages. A protocol consists of
the rules by which a computer communicates with another computer.

Using Jabber, Convey provides users connections to other popular IM programs,
such as AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ, MSN Instant Messenger, and Yahoo!
Messenger.
