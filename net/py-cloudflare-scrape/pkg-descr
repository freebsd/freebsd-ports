A simple Python module to bypass Cloudflare's anti-bot page (also known as "I'm
Under Attack Mode", or IUAM), implemented with Requests. Cloudflare changes
their techniques periodically, so I will update this repo frequently.

This can be useful if you wish to scrape or crawl a website protected with
Cloudflare. Cloudflare's anti-bot page currently just checks if the client
supports Javascript, though they may add additional techniques in the future.
