Automating command line interface (CLI) interactions is not a new idea, but can
be tricky to implement. This module aims to provide a simple and manageable
interface to CLI interactions, supporting:
- SSH, Telnet and Serial-Line connections
- Unix and Windows support
- Reuseable device command phrasebooks
