RUDE stands for Real-time UDP Data Emitter and CRUDE for Collector for RUDE. 
RUDE is a small and flexible program that generates traffic to the network, 
which can be received and logged on the other side of the network with the 
CRUDE. Currently these programs can generate and measure only UDP traffic.
Actually these tools were designed and coded bacause of the accuracy 
limitations in the MGEN program.
