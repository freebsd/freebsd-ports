Python MQTT version 3.1/3.1.1 client class

The MQTT protocol is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things"
connectivity protocol. Designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe
messaging transport, it is useful for connections with remote locations where
a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
