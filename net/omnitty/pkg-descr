Omnitty is a curses-based program that allows one to log into several
machines simultaneously and interact with them, selectively directing
input to individual machines or groups of selected machines.

You can run both line-oriented and screen oriented in the target
machines, because Omnitty has built-in terminal emulation capability.
When the window is large enough, Omnitty also displays a "summary area"
for each machine, in which it shows what the latest output from the
machine was, so you can have an idea of what is going on in each machine.
