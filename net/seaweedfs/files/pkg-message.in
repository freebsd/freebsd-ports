SeaweedFS presents a simple interface behind a complex distributed system.

For a single node "demo setup" you can just run:

$ mkdir /tmp/weeds
$ %%PREFIX%%/bin/weed -logtostderr server -dir /tmp/weeds -s3

For a more typical setup, you should have either 1 or 3 masters, and
multiple filers, with replication enabled.

Adjust %%PREFIX%%/etc/seaweedfs/*.toml according to your requirements,
using the sample configs in the same directory. Most parameters can be
ignored, refer to the seaweedfs wiki for further explanations.

Please read the documentation carefully, particularly around data
replication, and running redundant masters. Prime numbers of servers are
your friend, choose them wisely.
