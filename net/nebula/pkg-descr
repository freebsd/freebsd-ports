Nebula is a scalable overlay networking tool with a focus on performance,
simplicity and security. It lets you seamlessly connect computers anywhere
in the world. Nebula is portable, and runs on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, and
Android. It can be used to connect a small number of computers, but is also
able to connect tens of thousands of computers.

Nebula incorporates a number of existing concepts like encryption, security
groups, certificates, and tunneling, and each of those individual pieces
existed before Nebula in various forms. What makes Nebula different to existing
offerings is that it brings all of these ideas together, resulting in a sum that
is greater than its individual parts.
