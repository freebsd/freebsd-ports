x11vnc is a VNC server for real X displays.  VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
is a very useful network graphics protocol which allows multiple simple
remote viewers to watch and control a single desktop.  x11vnc differs from
traditional UNIX VNC servers in that it is accessing a real X displays that
may already be in progress rather than creating it's own X server for clients
to connect to.
