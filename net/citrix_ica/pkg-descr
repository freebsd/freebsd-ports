Citrix(R) Presentation Server(TM) runs on Microsoft(R) Windows Server(TM) and
UNIX(R) operating systems, and extends the base Windows Terminal Services
platform by enhancing the end-user experience as well as increasing
manageability, compatibility, security and scalability to address
business-critical environments.

This port includes the Citrix(R) Receiver(TM) software which allows connecting
to Citrix(R) Presentation Server(TM).

You will need to create the directory ${LINUXBASE}/dev or risk crashing your
system.

If your Citrix server does not have one of the supplied root-certificates, you
can copy the certificate to /usr/ports/distfiles and add the following line to
your /etc/make.conf:

	ICA_CERTS=mycert.crt

It will then automatically be installed and removed with the normal FreeBSD
package tools.
