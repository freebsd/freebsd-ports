drive is a tiny program to pull or push Google Drive files.

drive was originally developed by Burcu Dogan while working on the Google Drive
team. Since she is very busy and no longer able to maintain it, I took over
drive on Thursday, 1st January 2015. This repository contains the latest version
of the code.
