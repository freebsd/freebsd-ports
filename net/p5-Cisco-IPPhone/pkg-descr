This Cisco IPPhone module was created to provide a simple convenient
method to display Cisco IP Phone objects and gather input from a Cisco
7940 or 7960 IP Phone.  This module supports all known Cisco XML objects
for 7940 and 7960 phones.  Knowledge of Cisco XML syntax is not a
requirement.

This Perl module gives the ability to use simple PERL objects to display XML
on the IP Phone unlike to Cisco Software Development Kit (SDK) which uses
Microsoft IIS Server, ASP's, JSP's, Javascript, COM Objects, and requires
knowledge of XML syntax.
