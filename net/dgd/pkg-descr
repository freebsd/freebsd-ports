DGD is a rewrite from scratch of the LPMud server.  It runs on Windows, MacOS,
BeOS and many versions of Unix.

This is the core distribution of DGD, providing all the tools needed
to implement interactive servers, for instance MUD, IRC, WWW, etc.
A reference implementation of a kernel library is provided, which can
be further built on. Normally with DGD, there is a kernel library to
define the programming environment and a database library to define the
interaction environment.

Please report bugs to <felix@dworkin.nl>.
