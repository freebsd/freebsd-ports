"echoping" is a small program to test (approximatively) performances of a
remote host by sending it TCP "echo" (or other protocol) packets.

- uses the protocols echo, discard, chargen or HTTP,
- uses UDP instead of TCP for the protocols which accept it (like echo),
- can repeat the test and display various measures about it,
- can use T/TCP on systems which support it.

It's useful for checking that http servers are running and not wedged.
