The enhanced Communication Abstraction Layer (eCAL) is a middleware that enables
scalable, high performance interprocess communication on a single computer node
or between different nodes in a computer network. eCAL uses a publish-subscribe
pattern to automatically connect different nodes in the network.

eCAL automatically chooses the best available data transport mechanism for each
link:
* Shared memory for local communication (incredible fast!)
* UDP for network communication
