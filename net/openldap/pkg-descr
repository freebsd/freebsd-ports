OpenLDAP is a suite of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers,
clients, utilities and development tools. LDAP is an Internet standard
directory service protocol that can be used stand-alone, or as a front end
to an X.500 directory. LDAP is defined by RFCs 1777 through 1779.

OpenLDAP is derived from the University of Michigan LDAP release 3.3 and is
distributed under an open source license.
