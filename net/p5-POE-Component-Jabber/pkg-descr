POE::Component::Jabber is a module that simplies for the POE
developer, access to the Jabber protocol through the use of one of
the four Client classes. With built in events for common Jabber
packets, all a POE developer need do is provide an event and arguments
for most events so the responses to the requests can be properly
handled by the coder.
