This little program polls network statistics and does a few things with the
data it gets.  It has small blinking lights for the rx and tx of IP packets,
a digital speedometer of your polled stat's currentspeed and a bar graph like
xload et. al which has a tx speed graph from bottom-up and rx speed graph
from the top-down. The speedometer keeps track of the current speed per
second and shows it in a color corresponding to which of rx or tx that has
the highest speed at the moment.  Also, the graph is drawn in a way that the
highest speed is drawn on top of the other while the other is in the
background.
