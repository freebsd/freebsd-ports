Based on the work of rdesktop, xrdp uses the remote desktop protocol to
present a GUI to the user.

The goal of this project is to provide a fully functional Linux terminal
server, capable of accepting connections from rdesktop and Microsoft's own
terminal server / remote desktop clients.

Unlike Windows NT/2000/2003 server, xrdp will not display a Windows desktop
but an X window desktop to the user.

Xrdp uses Xvnc or X11rdp to manage the X session.
