xrdp has been installed.

There is an rc.d script, so the service can be enabled by adding this line
in /etc/rc.conf:

xrdp_enable="YES"
xrdp_sesman_enable="YES"

Do not forget to edit the configuration files in "%%ETCDIR%%"
and the "%%ETCDIR%%/startwm.sh" script.

To enable audio redirection, install the following ports/packages to meet
your environment.

- audio/pipewire-module-xrdp
- audio/pulseaudio-module-xrdp
