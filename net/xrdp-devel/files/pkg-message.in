XRDP has been installed.

There is an rc.d script, so the service can be enabled by adding this line
in /etc/rc.conf:

xrdp_enable="YES"
xrdp_sesman_enable="YES" # if you want to run xrdp-sesman on the same machine

Do not forget to edit the configuration files in "%%PREFIX%%/etc/xrdp"
and the "%%PREFIX%%/etc/xrdp/startwm.sh" script.
