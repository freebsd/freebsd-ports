Net::Daemon is an abstract base class for implementing portable server
applications in a very simple way. The module is designed for Perl 5.005
and threads, but can work with fork() and Perl 5.004.

The Net::Daemon class offers methods for the most common tasks a daemon
needs: Starting up, logging, accepting clients, authorization,
restricting its own environment for security and doing the true work.
You only have to override those methods that aren't appropriate for you,
but typically inheriting will safe you a lot of work anyways.
