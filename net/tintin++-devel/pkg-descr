TINTIN++ is a client program specialized to help playing muds.
This is a souped up version of TINTIN III, many new features
have been added since III.  We saw room for improvement on the
features available from TINTIN, and since we like the format of
the program, we decided to use TINTIN as a base for what we
hope to make one of the most powerful clients around.
