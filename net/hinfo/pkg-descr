hinfo is a utility that will display information about a host. It is
primarily designed to find the owner of an IP block in order to direct
spam complaints to where they may do some good.

(maintainer's note: the DATAFILES are updated without the port version
necessarily being updated.  Expect drift on distinfo.  See hinfo-update.)

Although the home page of the software is at www.blars.org/hinfo.html,
that page is not reachable from the FreeBSD.org domain.
