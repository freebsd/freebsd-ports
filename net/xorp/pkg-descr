XORP is the eXtensible Open Router Platform.

The XORP project is developing an open source software router. The software
is intended to be stable and fully featured enough for production use, and
flexible and extensible enough for research use.  The software is covered by
a BSD-style license and the code is publicly available allowing deployment,
development, and commericalization.
