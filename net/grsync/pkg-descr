Grsync is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for rsync, the commandline directory
synchronization tool. It makes use of the GTK libraries and is released under
the GPL license, so it is opensource. It doesn't support all of rsync features,
but can be effectively used to synchronize local directories and supports
remote targets in a limited way (read: manual).
