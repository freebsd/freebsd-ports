sngrep - SIP Messages flow viewer

sngrep is a terminal tool that groups SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
Messages by Call-Id, and displays them in arrow flows similar to the used in
SIP RFCs. The aim of this tool is to make easier the process of learnig or
debugging SIP. It recognizes UDP, TCP and partially TLS SIP packets and
understands bpf filter logic in the same way ngrep and tcpdump does.
