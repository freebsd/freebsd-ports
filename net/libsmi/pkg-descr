The purpose of libsmi is to give network management applications 
a concise programmer-friendly interface to access MIB module information, 
separate the knowledge on SMI from the main parts of management applications, 
allow to add new kinds of MIB repositories without the need 
to adapt applications that make use of libsmi. 

There are also simple tools to handle MIBs included.
