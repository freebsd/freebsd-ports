ncat is much like cat(1), but either its input or output is a TCP/IP socket
rather than a file descriptor.  If the input is from a socket, ncat reads data
from the specified socket and sends the data to stdout.  If the output is to a
socket, ncat reads data from stdin and sends the data to the specified socket.

ncat can log the data stream in three formats.  Which format to use (if any)
should be chosen according to the nature of the data being streamed.
