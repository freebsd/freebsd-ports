TAS is a traffic accounting system that picks up ip and application level
traffic statistics, stores it and processes to build reports. Report is a set
of user-defined tables. Table columns and rows are groups of hosts (traffic
sources or destinations) aggregated according to the rules defined by user.
What TAS can let you, in a few words:
- Do traffic accounting on IP-level and application level
- Store all accounting data for the desirable number of months for later
  data extraction
- Generate complex reports (in HTML or plain text) according to the
  specified rules either on periodic basis or on demand
- Have a convinient web interface for easy definition of report rules and
  quick report generation
What TAS is not intended for:
- Time accounting
- Accounting for non IP or IP-based traffic
- Accounting by username (in case of password-based internet access)
- Charging/Pricing/Billing/Client management
- Gathering traffic accounting information from the router interfaces
  like trafd, bpft, ipacctd, or ipa do (TAS is just a front-end for such kind
  of programs)
- Reports generation for arbitrary time intervals
