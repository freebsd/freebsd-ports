nDPI is a ntop-maintained superset of the popular OpenDPI library. Its goal is
to extend the original library by adding new protocols that are otherwise
available only on the paid version of OpenDPI. Furthermore, we have modified
nDPI do be more suitable for traffic monitoring applications, by disabling
specific features that slow down the DPI engine while being them un-necessary
for network traffic monitoring.
