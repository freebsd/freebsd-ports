Container networking relies on NAT to allow container network packets
out to the host's network. This requires a PF firewall to perform the
translation. A simple example is included - to use it:

# cp /usr/local/etc/containers/pf.conf.sample /etc/pf.conf
...
Edit /etc/pf.conf and set v4egress_if, v6egress_if to your network interface(s)
...
# sysrc pf_enable=YES
# service pf start

The sample PF configuration includes support for port redirections. These are
implemented as redirect rules in anchors nested under cni-rdr.

Support for redirecting connections from the container host to services running
inside a container is included for FreeBSD 13.3 and later. To enable this, first
load the pf kernel module, by adding pf_load="YES" to /boot/loader.conf and
enable PF support for these redirections using sysctl:

# kldload pf
# sysctl net.pf.filter_local=1
# service pf restart

Redirect rules will work if the destination address is localhost (e.g. 127.0.0.1
or ::1) - to enable this, the following line must be included in your
/etc/pf.conf:

nat-anchor "cni-rdr/*"

if upgrading from an older version, this needs to be added to /etc/pf.conf.

For example if host port 1234 is redirected to an http service running in a
container, you could connect to it using:

# fetch -o- http://$(hostname):1234

or

# fetch -o- http://localhost:1234
