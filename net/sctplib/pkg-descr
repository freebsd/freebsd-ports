The SCTPLIB library is a prototype implementation of the Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP), a message-oriented reliable transport protocol
that supports multi-homing, and multiple message streams multiplexed within an
SCTP connection (also named association). SCTP is described in RFC 4960. The
API of the library is modeled after Section 10 of RFC 4960, and most
parameters and functions should be self-explanatory to the user familiar with
this document. In addition to these interface functions between an Upper Layer
Protocol (ULP) and an SCTP instance, the library also provides a number of
helper functions that can be used to manage callbacks and timers, as well as
UDP sockets for simple IPC. Furthermore, SCTPLIB provides support for UDP
encapsulation, making it possible to co-exist with kernel SCTP
implementations.
