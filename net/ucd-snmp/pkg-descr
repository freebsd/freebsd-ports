This is UCD SNMP, a derivative of CMU's SNMP package.

From the README:

This package contains a port and modified code of the CMU 2.1.2.1
snmp agent.  It has been modified to allow extensibility quickly
and easily.  It is far from the best and most configurable systems;
but hey: its free.
  
We use this agent here to monitor known system problems before they
take the machine over.  The agent can be easily configured to
monitor the number of a given process running, run external scripts
to check and report functional status.  Examples: mountd(s) under
Ultrix 4.3 which tend to fork themselves crazy and eventually fill
up the process table; On our hp700s, "amd" sometimes stops working,
HP VUE hangs and fails to start X, etc.
