****  To setup dhcpd, you may have to copy %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf.sample
      to %%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf for editing.

****  This port installs dhcp daemon, but don't invokes dhcpd by default. If
      you want to invoke dhcpd at startup, put these lines into /etc/rc.conf.

	    dhcpd_enable="YES"
	    dhcpd_flags=""				# command option(s)
	    dhcpd_conf="%%PREFIX%%/etc/dhcpd.conf"	# configuration file
	    dhcpd_ifaces=""				# ethernet interface(s)

****  For instance, rc.conf like variables are still read from %%PREFIX%%\
      /etc/rc.isc-dhcpd.conf. They should be move into /etc/rc.conf.  Also,
      the dhcpd_options variable must be renamed dhcpd_flags.

****  If compiled with paranoia support (the default), the following options
      are also supported:

            [-user user] [-group group] [-chroot dir] [-early_chroot]

****  If compiled with jail support (the default), the following options are
      also supported:

            [-chroot dir] [-jail hostname ip_address]	# implies -early_chroot
