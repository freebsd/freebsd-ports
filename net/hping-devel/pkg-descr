hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer.
The interface is inspired to the ping(8) Unix command, but hping isn't
only able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and
RAW-IP protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files
between a covered channel, and many other features.
While hping was mainly used as a security tool in the past, it can be
used in many ways by people that don't care about security to test
networks and hosts.

hping3 adds the TCL scripting feature.
