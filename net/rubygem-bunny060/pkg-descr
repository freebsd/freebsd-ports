Bunny is an AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) client, written in Ruby,
that is intended to allow you to interact with AMQP-compliant message
brokers/servers such as RabbitMQ in a synchronous fashion.

It is based on a great deal of useful code from amqp by Aman Gupta and Carrot
by Amos Elliston.

You can use Bunny to :
* Create and delete exchanges
* Create and delete queues
* Publish and consume messages

Bunny is known to work with RabbitMQ versions 1.5.4 and above with version 0-8
of the AMQP specification.
