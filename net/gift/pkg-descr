The FastTrack network (http://www.fasttrack.nu/) is a peer-to-peer
network for sharing files. It provides search facilities, and has
a 2 level hierarchical scheme for organizing peers.

Being a peer-to-peer network, there is no central server during
normal operation. All communication is done between peers.

giFT is the generic interface to FastTrack. It is intended to be
interoperable with existing clients, and to speak a compatible
protocol to that of the FastTrack network in order to communicate
with peers. This program's reason for existing is as a compatible,
interoperable, open source, Linux-based peer for the network.

Unlike the existing clients, giFT uses a central server only extremely
rarely. It does not require registrations or logins, and is not
trying to show users advertisements. The issue of locating network
peers is discussed later on. In particular, giFT does not contact
the Morpheus, KaZaA, or Grokster central servers at all. giFT is
Open Source (See COPYING).
