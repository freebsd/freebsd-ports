This is a client for OpenStack Nova API. There's a Python API (the novaclient
module), and a command-line script (installed as nova). Each implements the
entire OpenStack Nova API.

You'll need credentials for an OpenStack cloud that implements the Compute API,
such as TryStack, HP, or Rackspace, in order to use the nova client.
