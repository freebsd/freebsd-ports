Jifty is a full-stack web framework. It provides an optional REST interface
for applications. Using this module, you can interact with that
REST interface to write client-side utilities.

You can use this module directly, but you'll be better off subclassing it.

This module also provides a number of convenient methods for writing
short scripts. For example, passing use_config => 1 to new will look at
the config file for the username and password (or SID) of the user.
If neither is available, it will prompt the user for them.
