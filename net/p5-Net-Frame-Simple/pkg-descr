Frame crafting made easy

This module is part of Net::Frame frame crafting framework. It is
totally optional, but can make playing with the network far easier.

Basically, it hides the complexity of frame forging, sending, and
receiving, by providing helper methods, which will analyze internally
how to assemble frames and find responses to probes.

For example, it will take care of computing lengths and checksums,
and matching a response frame to the requesting frame.
