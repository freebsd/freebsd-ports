I. What is DCTC
DCTC is a Direct Connect clone, a windoz client allowing users to
share their files and talk (like IRC but more software sharing
oriented) using a proprietary protocol.

DCTC stands for Direct Connect Text Client.

II. What is not DCTC
DCTC is written from scratch without any help from neo-modus using
our experience of hotline protocol.

DCTC is not designed to be used by human. It doesn't contains any
GUI or CLI. The goal of this project is to build a Direct Connect
client which can be used by other programs. So even if you can enter
command using the keyboard, don't say the human interface is poor.
