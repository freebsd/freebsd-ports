ssltunnel is a client/server software to establish PPP links over
SSL/TLS sessions. Client and server are mutually authenticated using
X509 certificates, PPP packets are encrypted/decrypted realtime on
each side. The client has the ability to initiate the connection
through an HTTP/HTTPS relay, even if an authentification is needed.

This is the server part.
