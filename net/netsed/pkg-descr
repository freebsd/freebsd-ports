NetSED is small and handful utility designed to alter the contents of
packets forwarded thru your network in real time. It is really useful
for network hackers in following applications:

  * black-box protocol auditing - whenever there are two or more
    propertiary boxes communicating over undocumented protocol (by enforcing 
    changes in ongoing transmissions, you will be able to test if tested 
    application is secure),

  * fuzz-alike experiments, integrity tests - whenever you want to test 
    stability of the application and see how it ensures data integrity,

  * other common applications - fooling other people, content filtering,
    etc etc - choose whatever you want to.
