Mosquitto is an open source (BSD licensed) message broker that implements
the MQ Telemetry Transport protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1. MQTT provides
a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe
model. This makes it suitable for "machine to machine" messaging such as
with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded
computers or microcontrollers like the Arduino.
