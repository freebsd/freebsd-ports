From the README file:

  TiK is a pure Tcl/Tk 8.x version of AOL Instant Messenger (AIM).  The
  TiK client began its life as a scaled down version of the native Windows
  and Macintosh clients.  However, TiK now has most of the features the
  native clients have, plus some extras.  TiK includes a graphical buddy
  list display plus packages for away messages, buddy pounce, buddy
  ticker, stock monitoring and im capturing.  It is very easy for end users
  to add new features to TiK, using Tcl/Tk.  TiK is meant to give UNIX
  users an alternative to the Java client.
