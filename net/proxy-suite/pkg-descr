The SuSE Proxy-Suite, a set of programs to enhance firewall security.
The first (and currently only) component being released is the FTP-Proxy.

* Securely relays FTP connections between clients and servers
* Can switch connections from active to passive and vice versa
* Utilizes port ranges for both control and data connections
* Provides extensive auditing (via syslog or rotating log files)
* Can separate user related from system triggered audit events
* Provides command restriction based on logged in user name
* Allows command argument checking with regular expressions
* Is able to retrieve configuration data from an LDAP directory
* Has been thoroughly tested against buffer overflow attacks
* Fully conforms to RFC 959 and 1123 (the basic FTP RFCs)
* Planned to support RFC 1579 ("Firewall Friendly FTP")
* Planned to support RFC 2428 (IPv6 Extensions for FTP)
* Based on GNU AutoConf, supposed to run on many UNIX systems
