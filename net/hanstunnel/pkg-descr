Hans makes it possible to tunnel IPv4 through ICMP echo packets, so you
could call it a ping tunnel. This can be useful when you find yourself
in the situation that your Internet access is firewalled, but pings are
allowed.

Hans runs on Linux as a client and a server. It runs on Mac OS X,
iPhone/iPod touch, FreeBSD and OpenBSD as a client only.
