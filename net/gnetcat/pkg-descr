Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and writes data across
network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable
"back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and
scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and
exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you
would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.
