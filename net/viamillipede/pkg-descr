viamillipede - Paralel TCP transport for pipes
Viamillipede is client and server program built to improve network 
pipe transport using multiple TCP sessions.  It multiplexes a single
 network pipe into multiple TCP con nectons and then terminates the
connections into a pipe transparently on another host.  
It is similar to the simplest mode of remote pipe transparency of 
Netcat with the parallelism from iperf
