Parallel TCP transport for pipes

Viamillipede is a client and server programm built to improve network
pipe transport using multiple TCP sessions. It multiplexes a single
network pipe into multiple TCP connections and then terminates the
connections into a pipe transparently on another host.

It is similar to the simplest mode of remote pipe transparency of
Netcat with the parallelism from iperf.
