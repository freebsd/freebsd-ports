This  tool enables you to download streaming content in Windows Media Format
to  your  hard  drive.  The resulting files will be in ASF format and can be
played with Windows Media Player and derived tools.

You  may  call  this  the  "DeCSS"  for Windows Media - although neither any
serious  reverse-engineering nor any particular knowledge about protcols was
necessary to program this simple application.

Development time overall:  several hours for a first, working streaming code
and   some  more  days  for  general  performance  tweaking,  cross-platform
portability,  the  Windows graphical user interface and the XML (redirection
file) parser.
