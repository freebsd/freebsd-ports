Rate is a swiss-army-knife command-line traffic analysis tool, designed 
to help a network administrator to see what is happening at a router at 
the moment. Unlike tcpdump(1), rate uses statistical and stream-oriented 
methods, and will never produce an output stream at a speed beyond human 
perception. The output is less accurate, however. Rate features four 
different operating modes, designed to perform the following tasks: 
estimating overall traffic rates, determining nodes generating the 
highest traffic, determining connections and flows generating the highest 
traffic and extracting strings from packets.
