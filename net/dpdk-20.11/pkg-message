The Intel(R) DPDK requires two kernel modules to be loaded in order to run.
To load these modules add loading lines to /boot/loader.conf

	contigmem_load="YES"
	nic_uio_load="YES"

The modules each take a number of parameters. These should be set in loader.conf
before the above two lines to load the module.

* The "contigmem" module is used to reserve contiguous blocks of physical memory
  for packet buffer use. It takes parameters for the number and size of blocks
  to be reserved. An example is below, reserving a single 1G block:

	hw.contigmem.num_buffers=1
	hw.contigmem.buffer_size=1073741824

* The "nic_uio" module is used to expose the network card (NIC) hardware
  directly to userspace for use with the Intel(R) DPDK. If the NIC ports to be
  used are in use by an existing driver, the nic_uio module can unbind the port
  from its existing driver when requested to do so. This is done by passing the
  relevant PCI bus, device and function settings to the driver as parameters.
  For example:

	hw.nic_uio.bdfs="2:0:0,2:0:1"
