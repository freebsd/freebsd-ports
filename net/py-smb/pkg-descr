pysmb is an experimental SMB/CIFS library written in Python.
It implements the client-side SMB/CIFS protocol which allows your Python
application to access and transfer files to/from SMB/CIFS shared folders
like your Windows file sharing and Samba folders. 
It was tested with Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Samba 3.x.

Modules
    smb - Contains all the SMB operations and constants
    nmb - Contains some of the NetBIOS over TCP/IP operations which is
          necessary for the smb module to operate.
