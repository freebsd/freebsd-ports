A pure-Python implementation of a WebSocket protocol stack. It's written from
the ground up to be embeddable in whatever program you choose to use, ensuring
that you can communicate via WebSockets, as defined in RFC6455, regardless of
your programming paradigm.

This does not provide a parsing layer, a network layer, or any rules about
concurrency. Instead, it's a purely in-memory solution, defined in terms of data
actions and WebSocket frames. RFC6455 and Compression Extensions for WebSocket
via RFC7692 are fully supported.
