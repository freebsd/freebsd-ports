This is a snapshot release of the NIS interface to Perl 5.  There are
three parts to the interface: the raw component (Net::NIS), the
object-oriented component (Net::NIS::Table), and the tied interface
(Net::NIS).

Unless someone provides strong reason to support the raw or OO
components, they will be marked as deprecated and not documented or
enhanced (but still supported for backward compatibility).
