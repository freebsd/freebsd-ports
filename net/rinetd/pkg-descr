rinetd redirects TCP connections from one IP address and port to another.
rinetd is a single-process server which handles any number of connections to
the address/port pairs specified in the file /etc/rinetd.conf. Since rinetd
runs as a single process using nonblocking I/O, it is able to redirect a
large number of connections without a severe impact on the machine. This
makes it practical to run TCP services on machines inside an IP masquerading
firewall. rinetd does not redirect FTP, because FTP requires more than one
socket.

rinetd also supports basic allow/deny access control and logging.
