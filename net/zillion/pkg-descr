The Zillion Project is a distributed computing project reminiscent of the good
old Zilla.app of NeXTstep days. It is based on GNUstep, the most promising
OPENSTEP replacement as of today.  Jobs can be created from simple template
projects and can be submitted with a single command to the Zillion Server
which in turn will distribute the job amongst the registered clients. No other
network resources than the distributed objects (DO) port of the server machine
has to be available. The key features are as follows:
 * Rapid turn around cycles for job submission
 * Dynamic addition/removal of client nodes
 * Full OO-design
 * No need for shared network resources
 * Real-time capabilities
 * Lean and clean
 * Open and free
