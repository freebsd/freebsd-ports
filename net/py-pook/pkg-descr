pook is a versatile, expressive and hackable utility library for HTTP traffic
mocking and expectations made easy in Python. Heavily inspired by gock.

pook can work with multiple mock engines, however it provides a built-in one by
default, which currently supports traffic mocking in the several HTTP clients.
