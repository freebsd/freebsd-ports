RSerPool client/server API library for load distribution and
Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) is the IETF's standard (RFC 5351 to
RFC 5356) for a lightweight server pool and session management framework.
It provides highly available pool management (that is registration
handling and load distribution/balancing) by components called Registrar
and a client-side/server-side API for accessing the service of a pool.
