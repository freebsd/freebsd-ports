Daemon::Generic provides a framework for starting, stopping, reconfiguring
daemon-like programs. The framework provides for standard commands that work
for as init.d files and as apachectl-like commands.

Programs that use Daemon::Generic subclass Daemon::Generic to override its
behavior. Almost everything that Genric::Daemon does can be overridden as
needed.
