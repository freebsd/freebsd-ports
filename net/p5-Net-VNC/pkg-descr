Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a desktop sharing system which uses
the RFB (Remote FrameBuffer) protocol to remotely control another
computer. This module acts as a VNC client and communicates to a VNC
server using the RFB protocol, allowing you to capture the screen of
the remote computer.

This module dies upon connection errors (with a timeout of 15 seconds)
and protocol errors.

This implementation is based largely on the RFB Protocol Specification,
http://www.realvnc.com/docs/rfbproto.pdf. That document has an error
in the DES encryption description, which is clarified via
