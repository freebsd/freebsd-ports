*** Web-based Monitoring & Notification for Systems and Networks ***

Big Brother is a combination of monitoring methods.
Unlike SNMP where information is just collected and devices polled,
Big Brother is designed in such a way that each local system broadcasts it's
own information to a central location. Simultaneously, Big Brother also polls
all networked systems from a central location. This creates a highly efficient
and redundant method for proactive network monitoring.
