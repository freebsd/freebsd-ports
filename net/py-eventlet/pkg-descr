Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python that allows you to change
how you run your code, not how you write it.

It uses epoll or libevent for highly scalable non-blocking I/O. Coroutines
ensure that the developer uses a blocking style of programming that is similar
to threading, but provide the benefits of non-blocking I/O. The event dispatch
is implicit, which means you can easily use Eventlet from the Python
interpreter, or as a small part of a larger application.
