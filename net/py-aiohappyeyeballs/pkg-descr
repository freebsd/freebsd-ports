This library exists to allow connecting with Happy Eyeballs when you already
have a list of addrinfo and not a DNS name.

The stdlib version of loop.create_connection() will only work when you pass in
an unresolved name which is not a good fit when using DNS caching or resolving
names via another method such was zeroconf.
