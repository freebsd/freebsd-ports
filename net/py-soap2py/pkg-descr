PySimpleSOAP (Python Simple SOAP) library for client and server webservices
interfaces, aimed to be as small and easy as possible, supporting most common
functionality. Initially it was inspired by PHP Soap Extension (mimicking it
functionality, simplicity and ease of use), with many advanced features added.

Goals:
- Simple: less than 200LOC client/server concrete implementation for easy
  maintainability and enhancments.
- Flexible: adapted to several SOAP dialects (Java Axis, .Net, JBoss), with the
  posibility of fine-tuning XML request and responses
- Pythonic: no artifacts, no class generation, no special types, RPC calls
  parameters and return values are simple python structures (dicts, list, etc.)
- Dynamic: no definition (WSDL) required, dynamic generation and parsing
  supported (cached in a pickle file for performance, supporting fixing broken
  WSDL)
- Easy: simple xml manipulation, including basic serialization and raw
  object-like access to SOAP messages
- Extensible: supports several HTTP wrappers (httplib2, pycurl, urllib2) for
  special transport needs over SSL and proxy (ISA)
