From the website:

The LDAP Browser/Editor provides a user-friendly Windows Explorer-like
interface to LDAP directories with tightly integrated browsing and
editing capabilities. It is entirely written in Java with the help
of the JFC (SwingSet) and JNDI class libraries. It connects to LDAP
v2 and v3 servers.
