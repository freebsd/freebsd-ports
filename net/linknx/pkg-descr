LinKNX is a backend for controlling a KNX/EIB home and building automation
system. It connects to eibd which is part of the BCU SDK and keeps state of
KNX devices such as lamps, window blinds, heating and so on.
Furthermore it provides a powerful, rule-based event after treatment, e.g.
for switching other KNX devices, sending e-mail or SMS or executing a shell
command. You can configure and control the LinKNX daemon using an XML-style
protocol via TCP network socket or Unix domain socket.
