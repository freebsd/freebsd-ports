This code produce bootloaders for a number of cards that can be
loaded from from raw or DOS-formatted floppy/hard disks and ROMs
to boot ELF/aout kernels over NFS or TFTP.
Edit work/etherboot/src/Config to see/set the desired features.

The defaults used here are suited to boot FreeBSD ELF kernels over NFS.

To produce an etherboot floppy (or HD partition) do

	cd work/etherboot/src 
	cat bin/boot1a.bin bin32/<device>.lzrom > /dev/fd0

Replace <device> with the specific code for your card, and /dev/fd0
with your hard disk partition.
