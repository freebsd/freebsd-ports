URI::Query provides simple URI query string manipulation, allowing you to create
and manipulate URI query strings from GET and POST requests in web applications.
This is primarily useful for creating links where you wish to preserve some
subset of the parameters to the current request, and potentially add or replace
others. Given a query string this is doable with regexes, of course, but making
sure you get the anchoring and escaping right is tedious and error-prone - this
module is simpler.
