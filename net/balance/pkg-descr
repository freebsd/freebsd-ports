Balance is a simple but powerful generic tcp proxy with round robin load
balancing and failover mechanisms. Its behaviour can be controlled at runtime
using a simple command line syntax.

The latest release now supports the definition of channel groups and
connection counting and handling boosting the power and versatility of
balance one big step further.
