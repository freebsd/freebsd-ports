An alternative to nss_ldap using an ldap based NIS/YP server.

This is a UNIX daemon providing NIS services with a modular
backend interface. The current focus is the development of
an LDAP module for the backend data source.

This daemon was (and is being written) in order to migrate a
large install base of UNIX systems utilizing NIS to an LDAP
based solution, eventually facilitating a migration of all
corporate services that rely on similar data to LDAP.

This (and future) LDAP related tools are being released under
the BSD License (with advertising clause).
