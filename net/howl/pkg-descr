Howl is a cross-platform implementation of the Zeroconf networking
standard. Zeroconf brings a new ease of use to IP networking.

Howl allows software developers to easily embed
Zeroconf/Bonjour(tm)-like functionality in their applications, making
cumbersome and error-prone network configuration tasks seem so five
minutes ago.
