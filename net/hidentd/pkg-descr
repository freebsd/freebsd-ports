hidentd is a simple and secure GPLed ident (RFC1413) server. It
requires either inetd, xinetd or ucspi-tcp to run. Basic
features:

* small and simple - around 300 lines of code
* secure - runs without root priviledges
* easy - no complicated configuration file syntax to learn.
* hidentd is entirely controlled with command line options.
* can be configured to provide fake usernames, protecting your privacy
* limited masqueraded/NAT connections support.
