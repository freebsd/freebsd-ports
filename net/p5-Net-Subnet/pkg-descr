This is a simple but fast pure Perl module for determining whether a given IP
address is in a given set of IP subnets. It's iterative, and it doesn't use any
fancy tries, but because it uses simple bitwise operations on strings it's still
very fast.

All documented functions are exported by default.

Subnets have to be given in "address/mask" or "address/length" (CIDR) format.
The Socket and Socket6 modules are used to normalise addresses, which means that
any of the address formats supported by inet_aton and inet_pton can be used with
Net::Subnet.
