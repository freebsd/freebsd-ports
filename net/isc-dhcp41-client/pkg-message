****  To setup dhclient, you may need to edit /etc/rc.conf to replace the
      base system dhclient, such as:

	    dhcp_program="%%PREFIX%%/sbin/dhclient"
	    dhcp_flags="-q"

      See dhclient(8), using the following command, for details about other
      possible options:

	    MANPATH=%%MAN1PREFIX%%/man man 8 dhclient
