utftpd is a TFTP server with fine-grained access control, support for
blksize (RFC 2348), timeout options and support for revision control.

You can assign three different kinds of rights to every client:
- read:		the right to read a file.
- write:	the right to write to an already existing file.
- create:	the right to create a file.

Clients may be specified by a single ip address or a range of
addresses or by ip address and mask.

Revision control is optional and will never be turned on automatically
for any file (you have to do the initial checkin into by hand).
