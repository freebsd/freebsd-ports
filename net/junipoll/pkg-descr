junipoll is an mrtg-like utility which polls the counter values from the
firewall filters configured on Juniper routers.  It creates ".rrd" files
with names matching the router and its filter counter names, each
containing a bytes and a pkts data source suitable for graphing using
RRGrapher or RRDTOOL.
