MAD-FLUTE is an implementation of FLUTE - File Delivery over
Unidirectional Transport (IETF draft). FLUTE is a protocol for the
unidirectional delivery of files over the Internet, which is particularly
suited to multicast networks. FLUTE builds on Asyncronous Layered Coding
(ALC), the base protocol designed for massively scalable multicast
distribution (RFC 3450). ALC is a protocol instantiation of Layered Coding
Transport building block (LCT) (RFC 3451). MAD-ALC is an implementation of
the ALC/LCT protocols. The MAD/TUT project is going on at Tampere
University of Technology (TUT).
