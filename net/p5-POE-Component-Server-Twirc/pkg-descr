POE::Component::Server::Twirc provides an IRC/Twitter gateway.
Twitter friends are added to a channel and messages they post on
twitter appear as channel messages in IRC. The IRC interface supports
several Twitter features, including posting status updates, following
and un-following Twitter feeds, enabling and disabling device
notifications, sending direct messages, and querying information
about specific Twitter users.
