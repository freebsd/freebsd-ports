This is the CVSup Mirror Kit, an easy way to set up a FreeBSD mirror
site.  When you type "make", it asks you a few questions about
which files you want to mirror, where you want to put them on your
disks, where you want to update them from, etc.  After a "make
install" your system will then be running as a nearly self-maintaining
FreeBSD mirror site.  It will even update its own configuration
files from the master site automatically.

This kit is not for people who just want to keep their own files
up to date with CVSup.  It is for people who wish to run servers
that distribute the FreeBSD sources to others.

This port requires CVSup version 15.3 or later.
