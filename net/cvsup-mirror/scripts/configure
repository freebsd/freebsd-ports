I am going to ask you a few questions so that I can set up your
FreeBSD mirror configuration.  Every question has a [default]
answer.  To accept the default, just press ENTER.

At this point, I am just gathering information.  I will not touch
your system until you type "make install".

If you are not planning to mirror the crypto files, just accept
the default answer for the next question.

Now you must decide which sets of files you wish to make available
from your mirror site.  You can choose any combination, and you
can put each set anywhere you want to on your disks.  Although each
set is optional, we strongly encourage every mirror site to carry
at least the main source tree.

    "main source tree, except crypto code (350 MB)"

Now, a few questions so that I can set up your CVSup server properly.

For security reasons, the CVSup server should run under its own
unique user and group IDs.  These IDs should have no special access
privileges.  Normally, the user "cvsup" and group "cvsup" are used,
but you can choose other names if you wish.  At "make install"
time, I will create the user and group, if they don't already exist.

For security reasons, you must use unique user and group IDs for
this.  Do NOT use "nobody", "nonroot", or "nogroup".

EOF

user=$(ask "Unique unprivileged user ID for running the server" cvsup)
group=$(ask "Unique unprivileged group ID for running the server" cvsup)

cat <<EOF

The CVSup server does its logging via syslog.  At "make install"
time, I will set up the logging for you, if necessary.  I will use
the "!program" feature of syslog to keep your CVSup log messages
separate from the messages of your other daemons.

EOF

while :; do
    facility=$(ask "Syslog facility for the server log" daemon)
    case ${facility} in
    daemon|local[0-7]|ftp|user)	break;;
    esac
    echo "Please answer daemon, local0-local7, ftp, or user"
done

cat <<EOF

You can control the load on your machine by limiting the number of
clients that the CVSup server will serve at once.  CVSup won't load
your network especially heavily, but it is more CPU and disk
intensive than most other file server software.

EOF

while :; do
    maxclients=$(ask "Maximum simultaneous client connections" 8)
    if expr "${maxclients}" : "[0-9][0-9]*\$" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
	break
    fi
    echo "Please answer with a number"
done

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

echo ""
echo -n "Building the \"config.sh\" file ... "
for var in ${variables}; do
    eval echo ${var}=\\\"\${${var}}\\\"
done > ${WRKSRC}/config.sh
