GNetwork is a networking wrapper written in pure C against the Glib/GObject
object framework.

The intention here is to provide a useful and easy-to-develop-against sockets
wrapper for GNOME2 & GTK+ 2.0 programs which require TCP/IP connection
capabilities. It can be used by programs which do not use GNOME or GTK+
anyways,however. It is NOT recommended or intended for high-load server
situations, just user applications which need TCP/IP networking. Proxies are
supported completely transparently, using the same settings as gnome-vfs.
