grpcurl is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's
basically curl for gRPC servers.

The main purpose for this tool is to invoke RPC methods on a gRPC server from
the command-line.  gRPC servers use a binary encoding on the wire (protobufs)
and is effectively impossible to interact with using regular HTTP tools such as
curl.  grpcurl accepts messages using JSON encoding, which is usable by both
humans and scripts.
