mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs in a
single network diagnostic tool.

As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host mtr runs
on and a user-specified destination host. After it determines the address of
each network hop between the machines, it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to
each one to determine the quality of the link to each machine. As it does this,
it prints running statistics about each machine.
