This module looks up the country of an IP or hostname, using the free
GeoIP Legacy file-based database. This database should be more complete
and accurate than reverse DNS lookups.

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest
mirror, or to analyze your web server logs to determine the countries of
your visiters.
