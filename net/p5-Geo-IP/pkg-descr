This module a simple file-based database.  This database simply contains
IP blocks as keys, and countries as values.  The data contains all
public IP addresses and should be more
complete and accurate than reverse DNS lookups.

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest
mirror, or to analyze your web server logs to determine the countries of
your visiters.

To install, see the INSTALL file.
