The DaNAMiCS project is to build a Petri Net editor that allows for
both correctness and performance analysis.  The performance analysis
will be performed by Steady State anaylsis and by simulation.

DaNAMiCS will also include support for Inhibitor Arcs.  This will
allow for priorities to be modelled and will increase the modelling
power of Petri Nets to that of Turing Machines.  DaNAMiCS will also
enable the user to model with Coloured Tokens, which greatly reduce
the complexity of the resultant nets.
