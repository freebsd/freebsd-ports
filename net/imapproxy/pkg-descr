The program forwards all IMAP traffic between the client and the server, but 
keeps the connection to the server alive after the client logs out. When the 
same user attempts to log in again, the proxy will use the cached 
username/password pair to authenticate the client, and tie the new client to 
the old server connection (which was kept alive).
