PyGopherd is a modern dynamic multi-protocol hierarchical information server
with a pluggable modularized extension system, full flexible caching, virtual
files and folders, and autodetection of file types -- all with support for
standardized yet extensible per-document metadata.

PyGopherd is designed to serve up files using the Gopher Internet protocol.
With Gopher, you can mount a filesystem (viewing files and folders as if they
were local), browse Gopherspace with a web browser, download files, and be
interactive with searching.

But this is only part of the story. The world of Gopher is more expansive than
this. There are two major gopher protocols: Gopher0 (also known as RFC1436)
and Gopher+. PyGopherd supports both.

PyGopherd also fully natively supports HTTP, the protocol used on the Internet
for most Web transactions. So, you can access a PyGopherd server using anything
from a small, 20-line client in mobile phone to a massive 50-MB web browser.
