GOA provides a centralized service that allows a set of online accounts
to be configured for use with core GNOME applications. In UX terms, GOA
provides a static list of online accounts that can be setup by users
(through the Online Accounts panel in System Settings). These accounts
can then be used by core GNOME applications.
