This is shelldap, a handy shell-like interface for browsing
LDAP servers and editing their content.

Among its features:

	- history
	- sane autocompletes
	- credential caching
	- site-wide and individual config
	- it's in perl
	- it's fun to say!  shelldap! shelldap! shelldap!

For more info, 'perldoc' the script.
