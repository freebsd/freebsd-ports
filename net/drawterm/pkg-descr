Drawterm(8) is not a Plan 9 program. It is a program that users of
non-Plan 9 systems can use to establish graphical cpu(1) connections with
Plan 9 CPU servers. Just as a real Plan 9 terminal does, drawterm serves
its local name space as well as some devices (the keyboard, mouse, and
screen) to a remote CPU server, which mounts this name space on /mnt/term
and starts a shell. Typically, either explicitly or via the profile, one
uses the shell to start rio(1).
