You have just installed the Linux client for the SpiderOak service.

Note that SpiderOak does not follow symbolic links when doing a backup scan,
so if you want to backup, for example, your home directory, you cannot simply
create a link under /compat/linux, but you have to use nullfs(5).
If you do not do that, you can only backup files under ~/Desktop and
~/Documents.

Example with nullfs:

 # mkdir /usr/compat/linux/home
 # mount_nullfs /usr/home /usr/compat/linux/home

You may want to add the following line to /etc/fstab

/usr/home /usr/compat/linux/home nullfs rw 0 0

If SpiderOak fails to start with the following error message:

process *****: D-Bus library appears to be incorrectly set up; failed to read
machine uuid: Failed to open "/var/lib/dbus/machine-id": No such file or
directory
See the manual page for dbus-uuidgen to correct this issue.
D-Bus not built with -rdynamic so unable to print a backtrace
Abort trap

Try to fix that with the following command (as root):

 # %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/dbus-uuidgen --ensure=%%LINUXBASE%%/var/lib/dbus/machine-id
