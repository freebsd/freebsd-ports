********************************************************************************

You have just installed the Linux client for the SpiderOak service.

Note that SpiderOak does not follow symbolic links when doing a backup scan,
so if you want to backup, for example, your home directory, you cannot simply
create a link under /compat/linux, but you have to use nullfs(5).
If you do not do that, you can only backup files under ~/Desktop and
~/Documents.

Example with nullfs:

    # mkdir /usr/compat/linux/home
    # mount_nullfs /usr/home /usr/compat/linux/home

You may want to add the following line to /etc/fstab

/usr/home /usr/compat/linux/home nullfs rw 0 0
