The Python Dugong module provides an API for communicating with HTTP 1.1
servers. It is an alternative to the standard library's http.client (formerly
httplib) module. In contrast to http.client, Dugong:

* allows you to send multiple requests right after each other without having to
  read the responses first.
* supports waiting for 100-continue before sending the request body.
* raises an exception instead of silently delivering partial data if the
  connection is closed before all data has been received.
* raises one specific exception (ConnectionClosed) if the connection has been
  closed (while http.client connection may raise any of BrokenPipeError,
  BadStatusLine, ConnectionAbortedError, ConnectionResetError, IncompleteRead
  or simply return '' on read)
* supports non-blocking, asynchronous operation and is compatible with the
  asyncio module.
* can in most cases distinguish between an unavailable DNS server and an
  unresolvable hostname.
* is not compatible with old HTTP 0.9 or 1.0 servers.

All request and response headers are represented as str, but must be encodable
in latin1. Request and response body must be bytes-like objects or binary
streams.
