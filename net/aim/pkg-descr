AIM is the AOL Instant Messenger.

The AOL Instant Messenger is used to see which of your friends (buddies),
family or co-workers are logged on to the Internet (and registered with AIM)
at the current time.

You can then send messages and chat directly with these people.

This port consists of AOL's Linux AIM client which runs on FreeBSD using the
linux emulation system.
