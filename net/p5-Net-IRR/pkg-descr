This module provides an object oriented perl interface to the Internet
Route Registry.  The interface uses the RIPE/RPSL Tool Query Language as
defined in Appendix B of the IRRd User Guide.  The guide can be found at
http://www.irrd.net/, however an understanding of the query language is
not required to use this module.
