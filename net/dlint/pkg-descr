`dlint' is a Domain Name Server zone verification utility.

`dlint' analyzes any DNS zone you specify, and reports any problems it
finds by displaying errors and warnings.  Then it descends recursively to
examine all zones below the given one (this can be disabled with a command-
line option).

You can run dlint on your own domains, or on somebody else's, because it uses
the standard DNS network protocol.  Dlint is very useful since most nameservers
do no more than syntax-check your database files.  Dlint's messages are very
informative and suggest ways to fix the problems, not just complain about them.
