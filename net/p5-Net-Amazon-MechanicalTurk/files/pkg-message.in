You need to do some things before you can use the Amazon Mechanical Turk:

1) Visit http://aws.amazon.com/ to create an Amazon AWS account.

2) Configure the MTurk Perl module with the following command:

   perl -MNet::Amazon::MechanicalTurk::Configurer -e configure

   Your configuration file will be created in the file
   %%HOME%%/.aws/auth.

3) Try out the samples in %%EXAMPLESDIR%%,
   if you installed them.

4) Use the MTurk Sandbox to create HITs in a development environment for
   free. This Perl module uses the sandbox by default.

5) When you are ready to submit real HITs, add the following line to your
   %%HOME%%/.aws/auth file:

   service_url: http://mechanicalturk.amazonaws.com/?Service=AWSMechanicalTurkRequester

   DISCLAIMER: You are responsible for paying MTurk workers for the HITs
               that you submit to the live service. Please make sure
               you know which MTurk service you are submitting HITs to -
               the sandbox (default) or the production service.
