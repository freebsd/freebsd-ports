GTK based Gnutella client which supports the standard Gnutella operations.

Search, download, file sharing, bandwidth limiting, host caching, as well
as some basic statistics. Now with enhanced features, such as PARQ queueing,
PFSP, push-proxies, and others, making it a stable and fully functional
graphical gnutella client for *nix systems.

An excellent way to find that hidden file on the internet that you know exists
but standard search engines do not seem to carry.
