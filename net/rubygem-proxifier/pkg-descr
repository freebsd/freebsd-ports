This gem was created for 2 purposes.

First is to enable ruby programmers to use HTTP or SOCKS proxies interchangeably
when using TCPSockets. Either manually with Proxifier::Proxy#open or by require
"proxifier/env".

The second purpose is to use ruby code that doesn't use proxies for users that
have to use proxies.  The pruby and pirb executables are simple wrappers for
their respective ruby executables that support proxies from environment
variables.
