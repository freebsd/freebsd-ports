	----------------------------------------------------------
	Existing users of 'wmnd' be aware that the graph scrolling
	speed is now specified in tenths of a second (previous
	setting was per-second), so you may want to update
	your ~/.wmndrc accordingly (this is the 'scroll'
	variable).

	Some modes look much nicer with a fast update. YMMV.
