The hf6to4 script can be used to setup IPv6 on your home machine and
network for exploring IPv6 without any registrations.  6to4 is a
mechanism by which your IPv6 address(es) are derived from an assigned
IPv4 address, and which involves automatic tunnelling to one or more
remote 6to4 hubs, which will then forward your v6 packets on the 6bone
etc.  Replies are routed back to you over IPv4 via (possibly) other
6to4 capable remote gateways.  As such, IPv6-in-IPv4-encapsulated
packets are accepted from all v4-hosts.
