	ATTENTIONATTENTION:

Note: Settings were NEVER saved for SharedFile and QueueList and
possibly some other lists... Due to this, unless you are using xMule
for the first time, there will be no saved settings for these two
lists; thus, it will think all of their columns are to be hidden.
 
Best fix: right-click on the grey top of each list and select each
item in that popup to display the columns... be SURE to quit xMule
after doing this because if it crashes you have to do this step
again!
 
Messy fix: rm /homedir/.lmule/preferences.dat this will remove
EVERYTHING, including shares and whatnot. The preferences.dat is a
binary file, thus it will be *incredibly* difficult to change by
hand.
