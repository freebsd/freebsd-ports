This takes from a search and turns it into a hash.

The returned has is in the following format.

{DN}{ldap}{attribute}[array of values for this attribute]

The reason for the {ldap} is to allow for other values and
the like to be tagged onto a hash for a DN that are unrelated to LDAP.

This function does not make any attempt to check if the search succedded
or not.
