py-radix is an implementation of a radix tree data structure
for the storage and retrieval of IPv4 and IPv6 network prefixes.
The radix tree is the data structure most commonly used for
routing table lookups. It efficiently stores network prefixes of
varying lengths and allows fast lookups of containing networks.
