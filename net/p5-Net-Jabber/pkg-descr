  Net::Jabber is a convenient tool to use for any perl scripts
  that would like to utilize the Jabber Instant Messaging 
  protocol.  While not a client in and of itself, it provides 
  all of the necessary back-end functions to make a CGI client 
  or command-line perl client feasible and easy to use.  
  Net::Jabber is a wrapper around the rest of the official
  Net::Jabber::xxxxxx packages.
