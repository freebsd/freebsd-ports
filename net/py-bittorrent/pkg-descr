[ excerpt from distribution's README.txt ]

BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely easy
to use - downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks.  Whenever
more than one person is downloading at once they send pieces of the
file(s) to each other, thus relieving the central server's bandwidth
burden. Even with many simultaneous downloads, the upload burden
on the central server remains quite small, since each new downloader
introduces new upload capacity.
