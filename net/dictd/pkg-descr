The DICT Protocol, described in RFC 2229 is a TCP transaction based
query/response protocol that allows a client to access dictionary definitions
from a set of natural language dictionary databases. While RFC 2229 is a
finished document, we plan to clarify and enhance the protocol definition as we
gain more experience with large dictionary database servers. By default, the
DICT protocol uses TCP port 2628.
