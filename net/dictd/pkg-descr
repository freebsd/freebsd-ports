The DICT Protocol, described in RFC 2229 is a TCP transaction based
query/response protocol that allows a client to access dictionary
definitions from a set of natural language dictionary databases. While
RFC 2229 is a finished document, we plan to clarify and enhance the
protocol definition as we gain more experience with large dictionary
database servers. By default, the DICT protocol uses TCP port 2628.
