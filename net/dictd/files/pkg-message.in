==================================================================

This port installs the dict daemon but does not envoke dictd
by default.

To invoke dictd on startup, put the following in /etc/rc.conf:

    dictd_enable="YES"

The dict client can be found within %%PORTSDIR%%/textproc/dict

Don't forget to install %%PORTSDIR%%/net/dictd-database
to run a dictd server without pain.
