quoted - QOTD Daemon

The QOTD Daemon 'quoted' listens on the qotd port (17) and responds with
a randomly selected 'quote of the day' from a 'quotes' text file, which
you can update with quotes of your own.  It will operate either as a
stand-alone daemon, or can also be invoked via inetd.

If you want, you can also have it listen on a different port, other than
the default 'qotd' port (17).
