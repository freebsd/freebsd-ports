to your classpath:

%%JAVAJARDIR%%/imq.jar - Connector to IMQ broker. REQUIRED

			 If you have only one jms provider used in
                         your application or not using application
                         server you will need this. Otherwise other
                         jms provider will most likely to ship this.

%%JAVAJARDIR%%/jaxm-api.jar - Java API for XML Messaging
                             MOST LIKELY NEEDED for JAXM applications unless
                         this api is provided by application server or OSGi
                         container already.
