GnoSamba is a GUI tool for the Configuration of the Samba,
the SMB file server on X11/Unix.  It will read, edit and
write /usr/local/etc/smb.conf, an alternate configuration
file, or from a network. It uses the GTK Toolkit and 
Gnome-libs.

This is an early development release, not all functionality
is implemented.  It will let you edit any existing
parameter from a text entry, but without any checking.
