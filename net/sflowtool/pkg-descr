Print binary sFlow feed to ASCII, or forward it to other collectors.

This tool receives sFlow data, and generates either a simple-to-parse
tagged-ASCII output, or binary output in tcpdump(1) format. It can also
generate Cisco NetFlow version 5 datagrams and send them to a destination
UDP host:port, or forward the original sFlow feed to a number of
additional collectors.
