Serviio is a free DLNA media server. It allows you to stream your
media files (music, video or images) to any DLNA-certified renderer
device (e.g. a TV set, Bluray player, games console) on your home
network.

Serviio uses a priority-based metadata extraction so that you can
choose what metadata should describe your media files (e.g. audio
track name, DVD cover, TV series and episodes names, etc.). These
include metadata embedded into the media files themselves, locally
stored metadata files and metadata that can be obtained online.
With this powerful tool you will be able to build your Serviio media
library easily and effectively.

Serviio works with any DLNA compliant device (TV, Playstation 3,
etc.) and some other (XBox 360). It supports profiles for particular
devices so that it can be tuned to maximise the device's potential
and/or minimize lack of media format playback support (via transcoding).
