IO::Socket::INET6 provides an object interface to creating and using sockets
in the AF_INET6 domain. It is built upon the IO::Socket interface and
inherits all the methods defined by IO::Socket. As a consequence, this module
is protocol independent, it can run both IPv6 & IPv4, when DNS names are
passed.
