rtpbreak detects, reconstructs and analyzes any RTP [rfc1889] session through
heuristics over the UDP network traffic. It works well with SIP, H.323, SCCP
and any other signaling protocol. In particular, it doesn't require the presence
of RTCP packets (voipong needs them) that aren't always transmitted from the
recent VoIP clients.
