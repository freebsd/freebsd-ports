Is this module just like Net::FTP?  No it is not!

   1. It is a subclass and not a new class that uses Net::FTP underneath. 
That means the object is a normal Net::FTP object and has all the methods 
Net::FTP has.
   2. It does not override Net::FTP methods (IE does not have methods the 
same name as Net::FTP) which means you don't have to sort through how the 
function differs from the standard version in the Net::FTP module.
   3. Its waaaay simpler to use without a bunch of weird config stuff to 
cloud the issue, odd hard to remember arguments, obscure methods to 
replace valid existing ones that are part of Net::FTP, or new methods that 
are badly named (IE think "grep" on this one). There are other things as 
well.
   4. It follows the paradigm of Perl name spaces, objects, and general 
good practice much better and in a way that is more intuitive and 
expandable.
