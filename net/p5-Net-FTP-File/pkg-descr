Is this module just like Net::FTP?  No it is not!

   1. It is a subclass and not a new class that uses Net::FTP underneath.
That means the object is a normal Net::FTP object and has all the methods
Net::FTP has.
   2. It does not override Net::FTP methods (IE does not have methods the
same name as Net::FTP) which means you don't have to sort through how the
function differs from the standard version in the Net::FTP module.
   3. Its waaaay simpler to use without a bunch of weird config stuff to
cloud the issue, odd hard to remember arguments, obscure methods to
replace valid existing ones that are part of Net::FTP, or new methods that
are badly named (IE think "grep" on this one). There are other things as
well.
   4. It follows the paradigm of Perl name spaces, objects, and general
good practice much better and in a way that is more intuitive and
expandable.
