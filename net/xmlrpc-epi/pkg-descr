xmlrpc-epi is an implementation of the xmlrpc protocol in C. It provides an easy
to use API for developers to serialize RPC requests to and from XML. It does
*not* include a transport layer, such as HTTP. The API is primarily based upon
proprietary code written for internal usage at Epinions.com, and was later
modified to incorporate concepts from the xmlrpc protocol. It passed the xmlrpc
validation test suite in December 2000.

As of Sept. 27, 2001, experimental support for SOAP v 1.1 has been added to the
library. This support is implemented transparently to the application such that
a single API can be used for manipulation of values, yet both SOAP and XML-RPC
can be read or written.

Various iterations of this code have been/are running at Epinions.com and are
sufficiently fast for the high traffic volume this site encounters, with several
xmlrpc type requests generated for each user http request. No specific speed
claims are made. Your mileage may vary.
