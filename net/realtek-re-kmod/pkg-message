Add the following lines to your /boot/loader.conf
to override the built-in FreeBSD re(4) driver.

if_re_load="YES"
if_re_name="/boot/modules/if_re.ko"

By default, the size of allocated mbufs is enough
to receive the largest Ethernet frame supported
by the card.  If your memory is highly fragmented,
trying to allocate contiguous pages (more than
4096 bytes) may result in driver hangs.
For this reason the value is tunable at boot time,
e.g. if you don't need Jumbo frames you can lower
the memory requirements and avoid this issue with:

hw.re.max_rx_mbuf_sz="2048"

To enable Wake on LAN (WoL) support you might need
to set the following tunables:

hw.re.s5wol="1"
hw.re.s0_magic_packet="1"

If you experience network hangs with IPv6 enabled,
you might need to disable the checksum offloading
by adding the following parameters to the related
ifconfig line in your /etc/rc.conf file:

-rxcsum -txcsum -rxcsum6 -txcsum6
