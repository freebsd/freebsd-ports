Python modules for implementing LDAP clients

pyldap is a fork of python-ldap, and provides an object-oriented API to access
LDAP directory servers from Python programs. Mainly it wraps the OpenLDAP 2.x
libs for that purpose. Additionally the package contains modules for other
LDAP-related stuff (e.g. processing LDIF, LDAPURLs, LDAPv3 schema, LDAPv3
extended operations and controls, etc.).
