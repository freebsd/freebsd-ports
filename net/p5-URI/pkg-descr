This package contains the URI.pm module with friends.  The module
implements the URI class.  Objects of this class represent Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI) references as specified in RFC 2396.

URI objects can be used to access and manipulate the various
components that make up these strings.  There are also methods to
combine URIs in various ways.

The URI class replaces the URI::URL class that used to be distributed
with libwww-perl.  This package contains an emulation of the old
URI::URL interface.  The emulated URI::URL implements both the old and
the new interface.

Some tests require an Internet connection to work and are skipped
if one is not active.

You need perl5.004 or better to install this package.  You should also
have the MIME::Base64 module installed.  Installation is otherwise as
usual:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Questions about how to use this library should be directed to the
comp.lang.perl.modules USENET Newsgroup.  Bug reports and suggestions
for improvements can be sent to the <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu> mailing
list.
