LambdaMOO is a network-accessible, multi-user, programmable, interactive
system well-suited to the construction of text-based adventure games,
conferencing systems, and other collaborative software.

Its most common use, however, is as a multi-participant,
low-bandwidth virtual reality, and it is with this focus in mind
that I describe it here.
