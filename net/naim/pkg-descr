naim is a console client for AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), AOL I Seek You 
(ICQ), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and The lily CMC.

It includes unique features like zero-configuration peer to peer encryption, 
automatic message queueing, and incoming message modification (to correct 
common spelling mistakes and expand common abbreviations; see /help filter).

It also includes powerful dynamic module support, allowing developers to 
modify all major aspects of naim's behavior.

When combined with GNU Screen, naim is great to use as a chat client as 
well as an answering machine. Individual users can detach, log out, pack 
up and go home, then log back in from anywhere on the Internet to resume 
their naim session.
