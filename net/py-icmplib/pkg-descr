icmplib is a brand new and modern implementation of the ICMP protocol
in Python. Use the built-in functions or build your own, you have the
choice!


    - Ready-to-use: icmplib offers ready-to-use functions such as the
      most popular ones: ping, multiping and traceroute. An extensive
      documentation also helps you get started.
    - Modern: This library uses the latest mechanisms offered by Python
      3.7+ and is fully object-oriented.
    - Fast: Each class and function has been designed and optimized to
      deliver the best performance. Some functions are also asynchronous
      like the async_ping and async_multiping functions. You can ping
      the world in seconds!
    - Powerful: Use the library without root privileges, set the traffic
      class of ICMP packets, customize their payload, send broadcast
      requests and more!
    - Evolutive: Easily build your own classes and functions with ICMPv4
      and ICMPv6 sockets.
    - Seamless integration of IPv6: Use IPv6 the same way you use IPv4.
    - Cross-platform: Optimized for Linux, macOS and Windows. The library
      automatically manages the specificities of each system.
    - No dependency: icmplib is a pure Python implementation of the ICMP
      protocol. It does not rely on any external dependency.
