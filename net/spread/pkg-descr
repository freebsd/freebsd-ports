Spread is a toolkit and daemon that provide multicast and group communications
support to applications across local and wide area networks. Spread is designed
to make it easy to write groupware, networked multimedia, reliable server, and
collaborative work applications.

daemon which runs on each computer that is part of the processor group, and
various utility and demonstration programs.
