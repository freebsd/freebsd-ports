This module provides a perl interface to the Twitter APIs. It uses the
same API definitions as Net::Twitter, but without the extra bells and
whistles and without the additional dependencies. Same great taste,
less filling.

This module is related to, but is not part of the "Net::Twitter"
distribution. It's API methods and API method documentation are
generated from "Net::Twitter"'s internals. It exists for those who
cannot, or prefer not to install Moose and its dependencies.
