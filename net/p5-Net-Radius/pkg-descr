The modules included here provide an interface to the RADIUS
protocol. It consists of the following modules:

Net::Radius::Packet     - Deals with RADIUS packets
Net::Radius::Dictionary - Deals with RADIUS dictionaries

This module is essentially the original RADIUS-1.0 distribution by
Christopher Masto plus a number of changes and fixes by Luis Munoz and
Ian Smith.
