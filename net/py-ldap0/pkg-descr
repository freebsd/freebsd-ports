ldap0 provides an object-oriented API to access LDAP directory servers from
Python programs. Mainly it wraps the OpenLDAP 2.x libs for that purpose.
Additionally the package contains Python modules:
- parsing and producing LDIF
- handle LDAPURLs
- parse and handle LDAPv3 subschema
- LDAPv3 extended operations and controls
- automatic tests with OpenLDAP server This package is a non-compatible fork of
  python-ldap and therefore uses the separate module name-space 'ldap0'.
