This is a server daemon, port scanner and (optionally) clients for FSP, the File
Service Protocol.
 
FSP is lightweight and connectionless.  It is typically used for offering files
to "anonymous" visitors over a congested link.  It uses UDP rather than TCP
sockets.  A service contact port (well-known port) for FSP has not been assigned
by IANA (per RFC 1700).  See <URL:http://www.faqs.org/faqs/fsp-faq/> for an
overview.

To use fspd, you must copy the fspd.conf.sample file, normally installed in
/usr/local/etc/, to fspd.conf and edit it.

You can run fspd from inetd or stand-alone.
