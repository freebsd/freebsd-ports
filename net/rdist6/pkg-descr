This is version 6.1 of Rdist from USC.  It is based on rdist from
4.3BSD (classic).  It includes all fixes for all bugs known to the
CSRG Berkeley folks.  It has been running at USC and numerous other
sites for some time now on a wide variety of platforms.

This version of rdist is not directly compatible with rdist
distributed with 4.3BSD and subsequent vendor releases, but does
indirectly provide full backward compatibility.

This version of rdist does not need to be setuid "root" at all.  Rdist
now uses the rsh(1c) [remote command] program to make connections to
remote hosts, instead of making the connection directly.  This
eliminates the need to be run as "root".  Many thanks to Chris
Siebenmann <cks@utcc.utoronto.ca> and John DiMarco
<jdd@cdf.toronto.edu> who came up with an rsh version of rcmd() that
makes this possible.
