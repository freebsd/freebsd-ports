This is NWSL (previously CSTC) version 5.0 of SOCKS, a package that allows Unix
hosts behind a firewall to gain full access to the internet without requiring
direct IP reachability.  It does require a SOCKS server program being run on a
host that can communicate directly to hosts behind the firewall as well as hosts
on the Internet at large.  It is based on the original SOCKS written by David
Koblas <koblas@netcom.com> and the work of the AFT working group of the IETF.

NOTE: The shared library features in socks5 require a dynamic linker that
      understands the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.  FreeBSD
      2.1.5-RELEASE supports this; so do versions of -current and
      -stable later than May 2, 1996.  All other features will work
      with FreeBSD 2.0 and later.

WARNING: Export of SOCKS from the US without a proper license is a violation
	 of ITAR rules.

WARNING: Commercial use and distribution of this software requires a license
	 from NEC corporation.
