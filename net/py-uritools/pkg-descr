This module defines RFC 3986 compliant replacements for the most commonly used
functions of the Python 2.7 Standard Library urlparse and Python 3 urllib.parse
modules.

For various reasons, the Python 2 urlparse module is not compliant with current
Internet standards, does not include Unicode support, and is generally unusable
with proprietary URI schemes. Python 3's urllib.parse improves on Unicode
support, but the other issues still remain.

This module aims to provide fully RFC 3986 compliant replacements for some
commonly used functions found in urlparse and urllib.parse, plus additional
functions for conveniently composing URIs from their individual components.
