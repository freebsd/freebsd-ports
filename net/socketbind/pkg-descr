This library allows you to bind any application which is dynamically linked
with libc. It provides convient way to bind socket's source IP to one of the
multiple IP's available on computer.

To use it first of all point LD_PRELOAD to installed library and set BINDTO
variable to desired IP address to bind.

Here is the wrapper to run any command binded to some IP address:
env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libsocketbind.so.1 BINDTO=$MY_IP_ADDRESS $*
