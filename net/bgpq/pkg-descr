This program is a lightweight access- and prefix-list generator 
for Cisco routers and GateD/Zebra. Access lists are generated 
based on RADB/RIPE data.

This tool is not so powerful as RAToolSet, but has some 
features missing in RAToolSet, such as optional filtering 
of more specific routes in the same AS or acl string aggregation;
also, it does not requires Tcl/Tk to be installed.
