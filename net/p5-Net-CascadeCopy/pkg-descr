This module implements a scalable method of quickly propagating files
to a large number of servers in one or more locations via rsync or
scp.

This module and the included script, ccp, take a much more efficient
approach that is O(log n). Once the file(s) are been copied to a
remote server, that server will be promoted to be used as source
server for copying to remaining servers. Thus, the rate of transfer
increases exponentially rather than linearly.

Servers can be specified in groups (e.g. datacenter) to prevent
copying across groups. This maximizes the number of transfers done
over a local high-speed connection (LAN) while minimizing the number
of transfers over the WAN.

The number of multiple simultaneous transfers per source point is
configurable. The total number of simultaneously forked processes is
limited via Proc::Queue, and is currently hard coded to 32.
