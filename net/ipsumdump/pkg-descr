Ipsumdump program summarizes TCP/IP dump files into a
self-describing ASCII format easily readable by humans and
programs. Ipsumdump can read packets from network interfaces,
from tcpdump files, and from existing ipsumdump files. It will
transparently uncompress tcpdump or ipsumdump files when
necessary. It can randomly sample traffic, filter traffic based
on its contents, anonymize IP addresses, and sort packets from
multiple dumps by timestamp. Also, it can optionally create a
tcpdump file containing actual packet data.
