This code produces bootloaders for many cards that can be loaded
from a floppy disk or burnt into an EEPROM as raw or hex

Netboot uses standard DOS drivers (either Packet or NDIS-2), all
network cards can be used for which those drivers exist, even PCI
and 100MBps cards. In case no such driver has been delivered with
a network card it can usually be downloaded from an FTP server of
the manufacturer
