Redpanda Connect (formerly Benthos) solves common data engineering
tasks such as transformations, integrations, and multiplexing with
declarative and unit-testable configuration. This allows you to
easily and incrementally adapt your data pipelines as requirements
change, letting you focus on the more exciting stuff.

It comes armed with a wide range of processors, a lit mapping
language, stateless windowed processing capabilities, and an
industry-leading mascot.

Redpanda Connect is able to glue a wide range of sources and sinks
together and hook into a variety of databases, caches, HTTP APIs,
lambdas, and more, enabling you to seamlessly drop it into your
existing infrastructure.

Working with disparate APIs and services can be a daunting task,
doubly so in a streaming data context. With Redpanda Connect, it's
possible to break these tasks down and automatically parallelize
them as a streaming workflow.
