This module overloads hashes so that the key can be a subnet as in
NetAddr::IP. When looking values up, an interpretation will be made to
find the given key within the subnets specified in the hash.

Care must be taken, as only strings that can be parsed as an IP address
by NetAddr::IP can be used as keys for this hash.
