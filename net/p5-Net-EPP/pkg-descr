EPP is the Extensible Provisioning Protocol. EPP (defined in RFC 3730) is
an application layer client-server protocol for the provisioning and
management of objects stored in a shared central repository. Specified in
XML, the protocol defines generic object management operations and an
extensible framework that maps protocol operations to objects. As of
writing, its only well-developed application is the provisioning of
Internet domain names, hosts, and related contact details.

RFC 3734 defines a TCP based transport model for EPP, and this module
implements a client for that model. You can establish and manage EPP
connections and send and receive responses over this connection.

Net::EPP::Client also provides some time-saving features, such as being
able to provide request and response frames as Net::EPP::Frame objects.
