If you need Measurement-Kit to query for GeoIP data, please consider installing
'net/geoipupdate' and updating your local databases:

  # pkg install net/geoipupdate
  # geoipupdate

Once you are done, Measurement-Kit can properly show country codes - but you
still must change your nettest options and specify the database file to be
used by 'geoip_country_path'.

Consider creating a cron job in order to keep your databases up to date.
