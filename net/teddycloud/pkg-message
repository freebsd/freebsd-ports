  message: <<EOM
Teddycloud will require exclusive access to following ports:
80: HTTP port for the webinterface
8443: HTTPS port for the webinterface
443: HTTPS API port for Toniebox API

If you have already daemons running using these ports like nginx, apache, haproxy
it is best to bind an alias IP (second ip) to your network card and use that exclusively
with teddycloud.

You can tell teddycloud to use this IP.
At first you must start teddycloud that the config file /usr/local/etc/teddycloud/config.ini is created with command:
teddycloud

After this you can change the IP teddycloud is using:
core.server.bind_ip=_your_alias_ip_for_teddycloud

To start teddycloud at startup:
sysrc teddycloudd_enable="YES"

To start in background:
service teddycloud start
EOM
}
