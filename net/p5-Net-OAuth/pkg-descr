Net::OAuth provides a low-level API for reading and writing OAuth messages.

OAuth is an open protocol to allow secure API authentication in a simple and
standard method from desktop and web applications. In practical terms, OAuth is
a mechanism for a Consumer to request protected resources from a Service
Provider on behalf of a user.

Net::OAuth provides:
- classes that encapsulate OAuth messages (requests and responses).
- message signing
- message serialization and parsing.
- 2-legged requests (aka. tokenless requests, aka. consumer requests), see
  "CONSUMER REQUESTS"

Net::OAuth does not provide:
- Consumer or Service Provider encapsulation
- token/nonce/key storage/management
