*************************************************************
Before using ldapsh, you'll probably want to :

- Create the configuration file (an example is in
  %%EXAMPLESDIR%%/ldapsh_config, modify it to
  suit your needs and place it in %%PREFIX%%/etc/).
- You can create a per-user configuration, just name the
  configuration file $HOME/.ldapsh_config.
- See %%DOCSDIR%%/COMMANDS for an overview of
  the available commands.
