ldapsh is an interactive shell you can use to administer ldap directories. It
provides an extensible command mechanism, with most of the necessary builtin
commands (such as 'clone', 'edit', 'rm'), and it's relatively easy to add more
commands.

It supports configuring multiple LDAP sources, and storing your UID for each
source so you don't have to type them each time.
