The Enhanced TightVNC Viewer package started as a project to add some patches
to the long neglected Unix TightVNC Viewer. However, now the front-end GUI and
wrapper scripts features dwarf the Unix TightVNC Viewer patches (see the lists
below).

It adds a GUI for Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix that automatically starts up
STUNNEL SSL tunnel for SSL or SSH connections to x11vnc, and then launches the
TightVNC Viewer to use the tunnel. It also enables SSL encrypted VNC
connections to any other VNC Server running an SSL tunnel, such as STUNNEL, at
their end. It can be used to perform SSH tunnelled connections to any VNC
Server as well. The tool has many additional features (see below for a list).

The short name for this project is "ssvnc" for SSL/SSH VNC Viewer.
