Braa is a tool for making SNMP queries. It is able to query
hundreds or thousands of hosts simultaneously, while being
completely single-threaded. It does not need any SNMP
libraries, as it is equipped with its own SNMP engine. However,
it's good to have a complete SNMP package including
"snmptranslate" installed somewhere, because for speed reasons,
there is no ASN.1 parser in Braa, and all the SNMP OIDs need to
be specified numerically.
