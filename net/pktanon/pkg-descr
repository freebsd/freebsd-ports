PKtAnon performs network trace anonymization. It is highly configurable
and uses anonymization profiles. Anonymization profiles allow for
mapping of arbitrary anonymization primitives to protocol attributes,
thus providing high flexibility and easy usability. A huge number of
anonymization primitives and network protocols are supported and ready
to use for online and offline anonymization.
