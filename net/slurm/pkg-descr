slurm - yet another network load monitor

slurm started as a FreeBSD port of the Linux ppp link monitor called pppstatus
by Gabriel Montenegro. Hendrik Scholz removed the ppp dependent parts and
the email checks to turn it into a generic network load monitor.

It shows device statistics together with a nice ascii graph.
