This is a port of librdkafka, a C library implementation
of the Apache Kafka protocol, containing both Producer and
Consumer support. It was designed with message delivery
reliability and high performance in mind, current figures
exceed 800000 msgs/second for the producer and 3 million
msgs/second for the consumer.
