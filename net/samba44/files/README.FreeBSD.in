FreeBSD specific information
============================

* Your configuration is in: %%SAMBA4_CONFDIR%%/%%SAMBA4_CONFIG%%

* All the logs are under: %%SAMBA4_LOGDIR%%

* All the relevant databases are under: %%SAMBA4_LOCKDIR%%

* Provisioning script is: %%PREFIX%%/bin/samba-tool

Samba4 provisioning requires file system(s) with POSIX ACLs support. At
the moment that is UFS2 only. You have to add 'acls' option to the mount
flags to get things working.

It is known that ZFS-only installations don't work out of the box with
Samba4. In partucular, s3fs service requires POSIX ACLs during provi-
sioning. It is possible to work around that requirement by specifying:

    # samba-tool domain provision --interactive --use-xattrs=no --use-ntvfs

And removing later in '%%SAMBA4_CONFIG%%' options like:

    'server services', 'dcerpc endpoint servers', 'posix:eadb'

and adding 'vfs objects = zfsacl' as well. Still this isn't supported
and tested configuration, so use it at your own risk.

You may find this tutorial useful, if you happen to run Samba4 on
ZFS-root:

To run this port you need to perform the following steps:
---------------------------------------------------------

0. If you had Samba3 port installed before, please, *take backups* of
all the relevant files. That includes 'smb.conf' file and all the
content of the '/var/db/samba/' directory.

If you had Samba4-devel installation before to my knowledge the best
option would be to start from scratch.

1a. Create new '%%SAMBA4_CONFDIR%%/%%SAMBA4_CONFIG%%' file by running:

    # samba-tool domain provision

1b. Or upgrade from the Samba3 'smb.conf' file by running:

    # samba-tool domain classicupgrade

%%NSUPDATE%%1c. You will need to specify location of the 'nsupdate' command in the
%%NSUPDATE%%'%%SAMBA4_CONFIG%%' file:
%%NSUPDATE%%
%%NSUPDATE%%      nsupdate command = %%PREFIX%%/bin/samba-nsupdate -g
%%NSUPDATE%%
2. Put string 'samba_server_enable="YES"' into your /etc/rc.conf.

3. Make sure that your server doesn't run Samba3, OpenLDAP and named.
Stop them, if necessary.

4. Run '%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/samba_server start' or reboot.

WARNING! This port is still experimental and if you need any asistance,
please, check archives of samba@lists.samba.org and ask there for help.

In case you found a bug which is clearly not related to the port build
process itself, plese file a bug report at:
