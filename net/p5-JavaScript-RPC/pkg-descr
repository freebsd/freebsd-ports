JavaScript::RPC::Server::CGI is a CGI-based server library for use with
Brent Ashley's JavaScript Remote Scripting (JSRS) client library. It
works asynchronously and uses DHTML to deal with the payload.

In order to add your custom meothds, this module should be subclassed.

The most current version (as of the release of this module) of the
client library as well as a demo application have been included in this
distribution.
