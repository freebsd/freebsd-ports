Clamz is a little command-line program to
download MP3 files from Amazon.com's music
store. It is intended to serve as a
substitute for Amazon's official MP3
Downloader, which is not free software
(and therefore is only available in binary
form for a limited set of platforms.)

Clamz can be used to download either individual
songs or complete albums that you have purchased
from Amazon.
