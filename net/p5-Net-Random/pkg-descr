Net::Random - get random data from online sources

This module gets truly random data from online sources.  Or at least,
they claim to be truly random.

The two sources of randomness above correspond to
http://www.fourmilab.ch/cgi-bin/uncgi/Hotbits?nbytes=1024&fmt=hex and
http://random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=1024&format=hex.
We always get chunks of 1024 bytes at a time, storing it in a pool
which is used up as and when needed. The pool is shared between all
objects using the same randomness source. When we run out of randomness
we go back to the source for more juicy random goodness.

The maintainers of both randomness sources claim that their data
is *truly* random. A some simple tests show that they are certainly
more random than the rand() function on this 'ere machine.
