NTLM Authorization Proxy Server (APS) is a proxy software that allows you 
to authenticate via an MS Proxy Server using the proprietary NTLM protocol. 
Since version 0.9.5 APS has an ability to behave as a standalone proxy server 
and authenticate http clients at web servers using NTLM method. It can change 
arbitrary values in your client's request header so that those requests will 
look like they were created by MS IE.
