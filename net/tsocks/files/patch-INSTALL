-NOTE: The install path for the library is _NOT_ prefixed with --prefix,
-this is because it is strongly recommended that tsocks is installed into
-/lib (and not /usr/lib). This is important if tsocks is put into
-/etc/ld.so.preload since /usr is not mounted on many systems at boot
-time, meaning that programs running before /usr is mounted will try to
-preload tsocks, fail to find it and die, making the machine unusable. If
-you really wish to install the library into some other path use --libdir.

-3. Compile the code by typing:

-This should result in the creation of the following:
 	- libtsocks.so - the libtsocks library
 	- validateconf - a utility to verify the tsocks configuration file
 	- inspectsocks - a utility to determine the version of a socks server
 	- saveme - a statically linked utility to remove /etc/ld.so.preload

-them, seek help using the contacts listed on
