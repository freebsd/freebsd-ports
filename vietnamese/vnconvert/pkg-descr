VNconvert is similar to the VPS "convert" for MS-DOS, and in fact, is based
on the coding table provided by Vietnamese Professional Society (VPS).

VNconvert converts Vietnamese text files between the following formats:

	VISCII (RFC 1456), VNCII (VPSWin), VPSedit (DOS), VNI, VNLab/VNU,
	VNU (Windows), VN Thin-Art (Mac), VN Thin-Art (PC), Viet-Toan, 
	Plain Vietnamese, and Standard VIQR (RFC 1456)
