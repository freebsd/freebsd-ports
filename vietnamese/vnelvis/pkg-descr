Tha^n cha`o ca'c ba.n,

VNElvis is a clone of vi/ex (the standard UNIX editor) that allows the
displaying and editing of documents in the Vietnamese 8-bit VISCII (VIetnamese
Standard Code for Information Interchange) (RFC 1456) data format using the
7-bit VIQR (VIetnamese Quoted Readable) input method.

It is expected that you will run vnelvis w/in a vnterm.  Because of the way
vi utilizes various key strokes, it may be better to turn off vnterm's VIQR
processing and allow vnelvis to handle the VIQR input itself.  You do this
by "set vnkeys".
Because "dd" --> "-d" in VIQR, "qq" has been added as a means of
deleting a line.  Otherwise vnelvis behaives as expected.
