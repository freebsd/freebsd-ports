The Pool Component

	Pool provides an Object-pooling API, with three major aspects:
	1. A generic object pool interface that clients and implementors can
	 use to provide easily interchangable pooling implementations.
	2. A toolkit for creating modular object pools.
	3. Several general purpose pool implementations.
