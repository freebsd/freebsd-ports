NetRexx is a new human-oriented programming language, designed to be a
simple, effective, and complete alternative to the Java language.  With
NetRexx, you can create applications and applets for the Java environment
faster and more easily than by programming in Java.

Using Java classes is especially easy in NetRexx, as the different types
of numbers and strings that Java expects are handled automatically by the
language. NetRexx classes and Java classes are entirely equivalent --
NetRexx can use any Java class (and vice versa).

NOTE: Remember to add NetRexxC.jar to your Java CLASSPATH or NETREXX_JAVA
environment.

For formal details of the language, please see the NetRexx documentation at
