Jad is a Java decompiler, a program that reads one or more
Java class files and convert them back into Java source files
which can be compiled again. 

Jad is a C++ program and it generally works several times faster
than decompilers written in Java.

No source code is available for this program. Jad is free for
non-commercial use, but not for commercial use.
