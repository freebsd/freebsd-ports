The Java 3D API enables the creation of three-dimensional graphics
applications and Internet-based 3D applets. It provides high-level
constructs for creating and manipulation 3D geometry and building the
structures used in rendering that geometry. With this sof tware, you
can efficiently define and render very large virtual worlds.
