FreeBSD port of OpenJDK 23

This version of the port passes basic smoke testing. It has been successfully
built on some combinations of FreeBSD 13 and 14 for the aarch64 and amd64
architectures.

Although these are untested, it may also build on other recent FreeBSD releases
for the x86 and powerpc64 architectures.
