.Nd format and display the on-line Java VM manual pages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Manvm
provides a convenient system for displaying the on-line manual pages
for different Java VMs without having to add their (conflicting) manual
page directories to
.Ev MANPATH
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
will select the most
.Dq native
and up to date version of the Java VM when locating the manual page to
be displayed.
This selection process is akin to that used by
.Nm javavm
in that the same environment variables and processes are used.
.Pp
The manual pages are displayed using
.Nm man ,
and all applicable environment variables, save for
.Ev MANPATH ,
are respected.
Options may be passed to
.Nm man
using the
.Ev JAVAVM_OPTS
environment variable and its associated sub-variables and configuration
file.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev JAVA_HOME
The presence of this variable in the environment when executing
.Nm
will override all other considerations regarding the Java VM whose on-line
manual pages will be displayed and the manual pages located at
.Pa ${JAVA_HOME}/man
will be used.
.Pp
.It Ev JAVA_OS
A space delimited list of operating systems.
The on-line manual pages to be displayed must come from a Java VM that has
been created for one of the operating systems in the list.
.Pp
Currently allowed operating system values are
.Ql native
and
.Ql linux .
.It Ev JAVA_VENDOR
A space delimited list of Java VM vendors.
The on-line manual pages to be displayed must come from a Java VM that has
been released by one of the vendors in the list.
.Pp
Currently allowed vendors are
.Ql openjdk ,
.Ql oracle ,
and
.Ql sun .
.It Ev JAVA_VERSION
A space delimited list of versions of the Java VM from which the on-line
manual pages may come.
By appending a
.Ql +
to a version, the on-line manual pages from any Java VM with a version
greater than or equal to the given version will be used.
.Pp
Currently allowed versions are
.Ql 8 ,
.Ql 8+ ,
.Ql 11 ,
.Ql 11+ ,
.Ql 17 ,
