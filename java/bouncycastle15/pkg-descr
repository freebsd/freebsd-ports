The Bouncy Castle Crypto package is a Java implementation of cryptographic
algorithms. It was developed by the Legion of the Bouncy Castle, a registered
Australian Charity.

The package is organised so that it contains a light-weight API suitable for
use in any environment (including the J2ME) with the additional infrastructure
to conform the algorithms to the JCE framework.
