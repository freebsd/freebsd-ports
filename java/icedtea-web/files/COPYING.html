 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Preamble<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.&ensp;&ensp;By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&ensp;&ensp;This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.&ensp;&ensp;(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)&ensp;&ensp;You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&ensp;&ensp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.&ensp;&ensp;You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.&ensp;&ensp;And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.&ensp;&ensp;If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.&ensp;&ensp;We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.&ensp;&ensp;To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&ensp;&ensp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.&ensp;&ensp;The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.&ensp;&ensp;(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)&ensp;&ensp;Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&ensp;&ensp;The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;License.&ensp;&ensp;(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.&ensp;&ensp;If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.&ensp;&ensp;But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;to distribute corresponding source code.&ensp;&ensp;(This alternative is<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.&ensp;&ensp;For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.&ensp;&ensp;However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.&ensp;&ensp;Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.&ensp;&ensp;However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.&ensp;&ensp;These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&ensp;&ensp;Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.&ensp;&ensp;You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&ensp;&ensp;If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.&ensp;&ensp;For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.&ensp;&ensp;Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.&ensp;&ensp;In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.&ensp;&ensp;Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&ensp;&ensp;If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.&ensp;&ensp;If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.&ensp;&ensp;For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.&ensp;&ensp;Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&ensp;&ensp;EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&ensp;&ensp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&ensp;&ensp;SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&ensp;&ensp;It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;&ensp;&ensp;&lt;name of author&gt;<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(at your option) any later version.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.&ensp;&ensp;See the<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA&ensp;&ensp;02110-1301&ensp;&ensp;USA<br>
<br>
<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year&ensp;&ensp;name of author<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&ensp;&ensp;Of course, the commands you use may<br>
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>
<br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>
necessary.&ensp;&ensp;Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>
&ensp;&ensp;`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>
<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>
&ensp;&ensp;Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>
<br>
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
proprietary programs.&ensp;&ensp;If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
library.&ensp;&ensp;If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>
Public License instead of this License.<br>
