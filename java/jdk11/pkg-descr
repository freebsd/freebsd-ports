Binaries of Sun's Java Developers Kit. Include bytecode machine,
compiler, demos and sources for most Java runtime classes.

Executables are installed into /usr/local/jdk1.1.8/bin. You may want to
put this into your PATH or symlink them to /usr/local/bin in case you
don't have kaffe installed (which shared many of the binarie's
names). 

You may want to build a kernel with
options         SYSVSEM
