			     Version 1.1.8

			   Binary Code License

This binary code license ("License") contains rights and restrictions
associated with use of the accompanying software and documentation
("Software"). Read the License carefully before installing the Software.
By installing the Software you agree to the terms and conditions of this 
License.

1. Limited License Grant. Sun grants to you ("Licensee") a non-exclusive,
non-transferable limited license to use the Software without fee for
evaluation of the Software and for development of Java(tm) compatible
applets and applications. Licensee may make one archival copy of the Software 
and may re-distribute complete,  unmodified copies of the Software to
software developers within Licensee's organization to avoid unnecessary
download time, provided that this License conspicuously appear with all
copies of the Software. Except for the foregoing, Licensee may not 
re-distribute the Software in whole or in part, either separately or 
included with a product. Refer to the Java Runtime Environment Version 1.1.8
binary code license (http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.1/index.html)
for the availability of runtime code which may be distributed with Java 
compatible applets and applications.

2. Java Platform Interface. Licensee may not modify the Java Platform Interface
("JPI", identified as classes contained within the "java" package or any
subpackages of the "java" package), by creating additional classes within the
JPI or otherwise causing the addition to or modification of the classes in
the JPI.  In the event that Licensee creates any Java-related API and
distributes such API to others for applet or application development,
Licensee must promptly publish an accurate specification for such API for
free use by all developers of Java-based software. 

3. Restrictions. Software is confidential copyrighted information of Sun and
title to all copies is retained by Sun and/or its licensors. Licensee shall
not modify, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract, or otherwise reverse
engineer Software. Software may not be leased, assigned, or sublicensed,
in whole or in part.  Software is not designed or intended for use in
on-line control of aircraft, air traffic, aircraft navigation or aircraft
communications; or in the design, construction, operation or maintenance
of any nuclear facility. Licensee warrants that it will not use or
redistribute the Software for such purposes.

4. Trademarks and Logos. This License does not authorize Licensee to use
any Sun name, trademark or logo. Licensee acknowledges that Sun owns the
Java trademark and all Java-related trademarks, logos and icons including
the Coffee Cup and Duke ("Java Marks") and agrees to: (i) to comply with
the Java Trademark Guidelines at http://java.sun.com/trademarks.html; (ii) not
do anything harmful to or inconsistent with Sun's rights in the Java Marks;
and (iii) assist Sun in protecting those rights, including assigning to Sun
any rights acquired by Licensee in any Java Mark.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty. Software is provided "AS IS," without a
warranty of any kind. ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED.

6. Limitation of Liability.   SUN AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE
FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF USING 
OR DISTRIBUTING SOFTWARE. IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE 
LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER 
CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF THE 
USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.      

7. Termination. Licensee may terminate this License at any time by
destroying all copies of Software. This License will terminate immediately
without notice from Sun if Licensee fails to comply with any provision
of this License. Upon such termination, Licensee must destroy all copies 
of Software.

8. Export Regulations. Software, including technical data, is subject to
U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act
and its associated regulations, and may be subject to export or import
regulations in other countries. Licensee agrees to comply strictly with
all such regulations and acknowledges that it has the responsibility to
obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import Software. Software may not
be downloaded, or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into, or to a 
national or resident of, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Sudan, 
Syria or any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii)
to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated
Nations or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Denial Orders.

9. Restricted Rights. Use, duplication or disclosure by the United States
government is subject to the restrictions as set forth in the Rights in 
Technical Data and Computer Software Clauses in DFARS 252.227-7013(c)
 (1) (ii) and FAR 52.227-19(c) (2) as applicable. 

10. Governing Law. Any action related to this License will be governed by
California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of
any jurisdiction will apply.

11. Severability. If any of the above provisions are held to be in 
violation of applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
then such provisions are herewith waived to the extent necessary for the
License to be otherwise enforceable in such jurisdiction.   However, if
in Sun's opinion deletion of any provisions of the License by operation 
of this paragraph unreasonably compromises the rights or increase the
liabilities of Sun or its licensors, Sun reserves the right to terminate
the License and refund the fee paid by Licensee, if any, as Licensee's
sole and exclusive remedy.
