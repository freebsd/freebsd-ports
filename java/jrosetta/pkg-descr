JRosetta provides a common base for graphical component that could be used
to build a graphical console in Swing with the latest requirements, such
as command history, completion and so on for instance for scripting language
or command line. This project can be seen as the evolution of the components
developed in JyConsole. For now, JRosetta provides only API and graphical
components. A Jython implementation for the scripting engine should be
available during the first semester 2009.

Functionalities
* Generic abstract API for script engine
* Completion window.
* Command history.
* Highly customisable, with external XML descriptor file. (Allow to specify
  the script engine to use, colors, font, shortcut...)

Platform compatibility
* JRosetta has been developed in pure Java, but relies on a JVM 1.5.
* No specific hardware is needed.
