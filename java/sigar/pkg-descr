The Sigar API provides a portable interface for gathering system information
such as:

* System memory, swap, cpu, load average, uptime, loginsi
* Per-process memory, cpu, credential info, state, arguments, environment,
  open files
* File system detection and metrics
* Network interface detection, configuration info and metrics
* TCP and UDP connection tables
* Network route table

This information is available in most operating systems, but each OS has their
own way(s) providing it.  SIGAR provides developers with one API to access this
information regardless of the underlying platform.  The core API is implemented
in pure C with bindings currently implemented for Java, Perl, Ruby, Python,
Erlang, PHP and C#. This port provides the Java bindings.
