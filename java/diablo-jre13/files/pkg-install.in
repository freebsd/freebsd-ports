	claims and without warranty of any nature, Foundation hereby
	grants to you, and you hereby accept, a non-exclusive license

	("Related Materials") in electronic format and/or one copies
	of the Related Materials in hard copy format subject to the
	following terms and conditions:

		(i)     other than as set forth in paragraph 1(a)
		above, you may not make or distribute copies of the

		(ii)     you may not decompile, reverse engineer,
		disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software to a
		human-perceivable form;

		(iii)   you may not rent, lease or sublease the
		Software;

		(iv)    you may not modify the Software or create

	you may create a hyperlink between an Internet website owned
	and controlled by you and the Foundation's website, which
	hyperlink describes in a fair and accurate manner where the
	Software may be obtained, provided that you do not frame
	the Website or otherwise give the false impression that
	Foundation is somehow associated with, or otherwise endorses
	or sponsors your website.  Any goodwill associated with
	such hyperlink shall inure to the sole and exclusive benefit
	of Foundation.  Other than the creation of such hyperlink,
	nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring
	upon you any right to make any reference to Foundation or
	to its trademarks, service marks or any other indicia of
	origin owned by Foundation, or to indicate in any way that
	your products or services are in any way sponsored, approved,
	endorsed by or affiliated with Foundation.

2.	RIGHTS RESERVED.  

	(a)     This License does not grant you any right to
	enhancements or updates to, or support or maintenance for,
	the Software or any modifications made by Foundation;

	(b)     Foundation is free to license the Software on terms
	different from those contained herein;

	(c)     Foundation and its licensors hereby expressly reserve
	all rights in the Software which are not expressly granted
	to you under the License; and, without limiting the generality
	of the foregoing, Foundation and its licensors retain all
	title, copyright, and other intellectual property and
	proprietary rights in the Software and any copies thereof,
	and you do not acquire any rights, express or implied, other
	than those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

3.      COPYRIGHT.  You hereby acknowledge and agree that the
Software is protected by United States copyright law and international
treaty provisions.  You must reproduce all copyright notices,
trademark notices and other proprietary notices of Foundation and
its licensors on any copies of the Software and Related Materials
and you must not remove such notices;

4.      MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT.  Foundation is under no obligation
whatsoever to provide maintenance or support for the Software or
to notify you of bug fixes, patches, or upgrades to the features,
functionality or performance of the Software ("Enhancements") (if
any), whether developed by Foundation or others.  If, in its sole
discretion, Foundation makes an Enhancement available to you and
does not enter into a separate written license agreement with you
relating to such Enhancement, then that Enhancement will be deemed
incorporated into the Software and subject to this Agreement.

5.      WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS
IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY TYPE OR NATURE, AND FOUNDATION AND ITS
LICENSORS HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR

NON-INFRINGEMENT OR ANY WARRANTIES ARISING BY USAGE OF TRADE, COURSE
OF DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.  IN ADDITION, FOUNDATION AND

NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, FOR ANY REASON
WHATSOEVER, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY IS ASSERTED ON THE BASIS OF
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), OR
OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FOUNDATION HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT SHALL FOUNDATION'S LIABILITY
FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED
THE GREATER OF $500 OR THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE.
BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE
LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  IN THE EVENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW
DOES NOT ALLOW THE COMPLETE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
OF CLAIMS AND DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, FOUNDATION'S
LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

all claims, suits, losses, damages, costs, fees and expenses arising

reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs.  You agree that under
no circumstances will Foundation indemnify you or any other person.

unless terminated by Foundation in accordance with this Agreement.

breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice
specifying the breach, this Agreement shall automatically terminate.
Upon the termination of this Agreement, you shall immediately cease
using the Software and provide Foundation with written certification
of your compliance with the foregoing.  The termination of this
Agreement shall not relieve you of your obligations arising prior
to such termination.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, Sections 5 through 7 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.

9.      EXPORT CONTROLS.  You shall observe all applicable United
States and foreign laws and regulations (if any) with respect to
the export, re-export, diversion or transfer of the Software, related
technical data and direct products thereof, including, but not
limited to the Export Administration Regulations.

Software includes Java2 Standard Edition (the "Technology") pursuant
to Sun Community Source License 2.3 Copyright 1994-2003 Sun
Microsystems, Inc.  All rights reserved.  You also agree to install
and use the Software on a product which (i) has a principle purpose
that is substantially different from that of the stand-alone
Technology; (ii) represents a significant functional and value
enhancement to the Technology; (iii) operates in conjunction with
the Technology; and (iv) is not marketed as a technology which

of this Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, Foundation

the intent of this Agreement.  This Agreement is binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of Foundation and its successors and
assigns.  This Agreement represents the entire understanding of the
parties, and superceded all previous communications, written or
oral, relating to the subject of this Agreement.
