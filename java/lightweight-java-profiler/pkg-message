To use the lightweight-java-profiler, you can invoke Java as follows:

java -agentpath:path/to/liblagent.so[:file=fname] It will spit out stack traces into traces.txt (or into the optional fname passed to the agent). The current implementation samples every 1/100th of a second. It stores the first 3000 stack traces it encounters; additional stack traces will be ignored, but duplicate stack traces will continue to be counted indefinitely (or until the counter overflows, which will take a while).
