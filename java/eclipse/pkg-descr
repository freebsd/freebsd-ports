The Eclipse Platform is an open extensible IDE for anything and yet
nothing in particular. The Eclipse Platform provides building blocks
and a foundation for constructing and running integrated software-
development tools. The Eclipse Platform allows tool builders to
independently develop tools that integrate with other people's tools
so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another starts.

Note, that for this port (to make it possible) the internal variable
ARCH is reset from "amd64" to "x86_64" to make the eclipse build
process went through.
