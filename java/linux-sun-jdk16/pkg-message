Warning: This JDK may be unstable. You are advised to use the native
FreeBSD 1.5 JDK, in ports/java/jdk15.

This Java VM will attempt to obtain some system information by
accessing files in linux's procfs.  You must install the Linux
emulation procfs filesystem for this to work correctly.  The JVM
will exhibit various problems otherwise.  This can be accomplished
by adding the following line to your /etc/fstab file:

 linprocfs   /compat/linux/proc   linprocfs   rw   0  0

and then, as root, executing the commands:

kldload linprocfs
mount /compat/linux/proc
