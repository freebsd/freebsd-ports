This provides an introduction to the Java SNMP package , an open-source
implementation of the SNMP protocol in a Java package. It provides support for
basic SNMP client operations as defined in SNMP versions 1 and 2 (excluding the
security model proposed as part of SNMP version 2, which was never widely
accept or deployed). The package provides a mechanism for "getting and setting"
SNMP object identifier (OID) values through a simple communication interface,
and represents SNMP structures and datatypes as corresponding Java objects.
The package assumes familiarity with the SNMP protocol as detailed in RFC's
1157, 1155, 1212, etc.; however, some simple examples are provided which
illustrate its use for simple get/set operations (though a knowledge of the
concepts of OIDs and SNMP datatypes is still required).
