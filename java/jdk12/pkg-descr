This is the latest patchset from the Java 2 FreeBSD porting project. This port
allows you to easily build native JDK1.2.2 for FreeBSD.

Please note that due to the current Sun licensing policy, the resulting binaries
couln't be distributed and you are only permitted to use/hack it personally.
Due to the same reasons you have to manually fetch source code and patchset for
FreeBSD.
