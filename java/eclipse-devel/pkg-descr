The Eclipse Platform is an open extensible IDE for anything and yet
nothing in particular. The Eclipse Platform provides building blocks
and a foundation for constructing and running integrated software-
development tools. The Eclipse Platform allows tool builders to
independently develop tools that integrate with other people's tools
so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another starts.
