JavaFX Scene Builder provides a visual layout environment that lets
you quickly design user interfaces for JavaFX applications without
needing to write any code.

It allows simple drag-and-drop positioning of GUI components onto a
JavaFX scene.  As you build the layout of your UI, the FXML code for
the layout is automatically generated.  It provides a simple yet
intuitive interface that can help even non-programmers to quickly
prototype interactive applications that connect GUI components to the
application logic.
