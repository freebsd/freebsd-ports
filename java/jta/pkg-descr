Java Transaction API (JTA) specifies standard Java interfaces between a
transaction manager and the parties involved in a distributed transaction
system: the resource manager, the application server, and the
transactional applications.

The JTA specification was developed by Sun Microsystems in cooperation
with leading industry partners in the transaction processing and database
system arena. See JSR 907.
