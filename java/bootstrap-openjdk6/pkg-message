WARNING: This port only exists for bootstrapping java/openjdk[67].
You are advised to remove this port as soon as a stable JDK is built.

This OpenJDK implementation requires fdescfs(5) mounted on /dev/fd and
procfs(5) mounted on /proc.

If you have not done it yet, please do the following:

	mount -t fdescfs fdesc /dev/fd
	mount -t procfs proc /proc

To make it permanent, you need the following lines in /etc/fstab:

	fdesc	/dev/fd		fdescfs		rw	0	0
	proc	/proc		procfs		rw	0	0
