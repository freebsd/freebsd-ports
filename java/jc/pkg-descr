JC is a Java virtual machine implementation that converts class
files into C source files using the Soot Java bytecode analysis
framework, compiles them with GCC, and loads them using a built-in
ELF object file loader. JC utilizes the GNU Classpath class library
and provides support for most features you would expect such as
reflection, user class loaders, etc.
