jabberd14 is the original server implementation of the Jabber protocol, 
now known as XMPP. It is open source, and it is free. This implementation 
has been formerly known as just jabberd as well.

Please note: net-im/jabberd (also known as jabberd 2.x) is not a newer 
version of jabberd14 but a completely different project.
