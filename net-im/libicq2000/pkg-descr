[ from developer's site ]
libicq2000 is an opensource C++ library being developed to support
the icq2000/2001 protocol. It is easy for developers to use as the
backbone for their clients' connection to the ICQ network - all the
protocol work is abstracted away in one nice object-orientated
interface.
