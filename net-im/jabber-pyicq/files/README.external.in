If you did not select WITH_JABBER, WITH_JABBERD or WITH_EJABBERD, you may want
to use another or external jabber server. To run the transport locally, you may
need to create the pid and spool directories manually.

Default pahts of the current installation are:
%%JABBER_PIDDIR%%
%%JABBER_SPOOLDIR%%

You should make these paths writable for the service user.
Default service user for this installation:
%%JABBER_USER%%
