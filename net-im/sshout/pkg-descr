SSHOUT is an instant-messaging platform designed to make uses of the existing
OpenSSH SSH server in your system.
SSHOUT creates a private chat room in your host. The authentication of the
chat room is done by SSH public authentication. Users can join your chat room
by either directly connecting the SSH server with any SSH client, or by using
a SSHOUT client that implements the client side SSHOUT API.
This package provides the SSHOUT server side programs; if you are looking for
a SSHOUT client software, see the project page. You can also create your own
client software using the SSHOUT API.
