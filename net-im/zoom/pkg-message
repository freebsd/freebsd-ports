You installed Zoom: A video conferencing client.

CAVEAT: Sound doesn't yet work in Zoom on FreeBSD.

In order to run Zoom you need:
1. Linux emulation enabled. For this you should execute:
   # sysrc linux_enable=YES
   and reboot and/or execute:
   # kldload linux
2. Have devfs mounted for the Linux emulator.
   For this you should execute:
   # mount -t devfs none /compat/linux/dev
   and reboot and/or add this line to /etc/fstab:
   devfs /compat/linux/dev devfs rw 0 0
3. Have Linux OpenGL package for your video card is installed.
   It could be one of linux-nvidia-libs*, etc.
   Enable a port option corresponding to your OpenGL driver, if applicable.
   Try running with LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 if zoom crashes because of OpenGL.
4. Have multimedia/webcamd installed and running. The usual way to
   start webcamd is to have these two lines in /etc/rc.conf:
   webcamd_enable="YES"
   webcamd_flags="-H"

Zoom stores configuration values in ~/.config/zoomus.conf, some
of which you can adjust.

If you have linux-c7-pulseaudio-libs or linux-c7-alsa-plugins-pulseaudio
installed and zoom asserts in pulseaudio, please change system.audio.type
to "alsa" in ~/.config/zoomus.conf
