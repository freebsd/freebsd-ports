Gyach is a Yahoo! chat program with a GTK+ interface.  It was originally
based upon the yahmini program (see AUTHORS file).  All yahmini code
has since been replaced.  Gyach was written for a few reasons:

1 - I run Linux at home and I couldn't stand the yahoo java interface.
2 - I didn't want to run qt unless absolutely necessary.
3 - I wanted to occasionally have something a little more fancy than
    the text-based interface that a few others are working on.
4 - I'm impatient and didn't want to wait for someone else to write a
    simple GTK-based interface.

So, I got the source to yahmini and created a GTK+ interface for it using
Glade.  Functionality was limited in the early stages, but I continue to
add new features.  Yahmini code has now been totally replaced as well as
conversion from Yahoo's older YCHT protocol to their newer YMSG protocol.
