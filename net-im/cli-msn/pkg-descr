CLI-MSN is a UNIX Command Line implementation of the MSN Messenger Client,
coded purely in C with the ability to work in almost any UNIX/Linux variation.
The desire for the creation of CLI-MSN came when little or no command-line
based messengers were found to be available that implemented MSN Messenger.

The client itself accepts commands based on that of an IRC clients nature 
(/cmd). Currently in the process of working out the file transfer.
