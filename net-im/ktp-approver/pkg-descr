The KDE Telepathy project aims to integrate real time communication
deeply into KDE Workspaces, and to provide an infrastructure to aid
development of collaborative features for KDE Applications.

This module notifies you when an incoming message or a file transfer
request arrives and hangs in the system tray until you're ready to
check it.
