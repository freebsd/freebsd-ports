Spectral is a glossy cross-platform client for Matrix, the decentralized 
communication protocol for instant messaging. Spectral is a Matrix client 
with the maximum features available while keeping a simple, clean and 
modern design. It is a Qt-based client as beautiful as Electron apps 
(e.g. Riot.im Web) while using far less resources and still being 
considered as "native".
