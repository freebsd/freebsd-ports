Tox is a decentralized, secure messenger with audio and video chat capabilities.
You can see it as an alternative to Skype.

This is only the core library. To use it, you have to install a client, like
e.g. net-im/toxic, net-im/qTox or net-im/uTox.

Tox isn't complete yet, but we encourage you to contribute to help make us
awesome!
