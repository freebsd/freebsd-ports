======================================================================
You installed qTox: Qt 5 based Tox client.

To have video working, you need:
1. Have multimedia/webcamd installed and running. The usual way to
   start webcamd is to have these two lines in /etc/rc.conf:
   webcamd_enable="YES"
   webcamd_flags="-H"
2. Make sure V4L option is "on" in multimedia/ffmpeg.
