The KDE Telepathy project aims to integrate real time communication
deeply into KDE Workspaces, and to provide an infrastructure to aid
development of collaborative features for KDE Applications.

This is the file transfer handler.

It basically does two things:
 * sends files to your contacts;
 * receives files from your contacts.

It doesn't set any filter on the MIME type, therefore, it should catch
all the file transfer channels that aren't received by any other
handler filtering on MIME type.
