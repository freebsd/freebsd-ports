    You have just installed the Linux client of Yoono.

    If you want to open links in your default browser, then you have to
    run the following commands (as root), before setting the relative
    option in the client:

        # mkdir %%LINUXBASE%%/usr/local
        # mount_nullfs %%LOCALBASE%% %%LINUXBASE%%/usr/local
