ToxBot is a remotely controlled Tox bot whose purpose is to auto-invite friends
to Tox groupchats. It accepts friend requests automatically and will auto-invite
friends to the specified group chat (default is group 0 unless set otherwise).
It also has the ability to create and leave groups, password protect invites,
and send messages to groups.
