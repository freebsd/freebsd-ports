TTYtter is a multi-functional, fully 100% text, Perl command line
Twitter client. It has the following features:

* A fully interactive client with asynchronous background updates and
  commands. Use it over telnet, ssh or even a dummy terminal.
  Supports ANSI colour, hashtags and Twitter Search!
* Works within your favourite environment: modify prompt and input
  methods for many popular window and session managers, or use a
  compatible readline library. Or don't: basic editing and screen
  management features built-in.
* From the command line, use it to update your Twitter in shell scripts,
  from cron, and so on.
* Supports standard timelines and automatically fetches direct messages.
* Extensible using the -lib option.
* Run detached in -daemon mode, and make your own Twitter bot!
