This module allows you to write a Stomp client.  Stomp is the Streaming
Text Orientated Messaging Protocol (or the Protocol Briefly Known as
TTMP and Represented by the symbol :ttmp).  It's a simple and easy to
implement protocol for working with Message Orientated Middleware from
any language.  Net::Stomp is useful for talking to Apache ActiveMQ, an
open source (Apache 2.0 licensed) Java Message Service 1.1 (JMS) message
broker packed with many enterprise features.

A Stomp frame consists of a command, a series of headers and a body -
see Net::Stomp::Frame for more details.

For details on the protocol see http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol.
