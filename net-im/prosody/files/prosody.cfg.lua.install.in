-- Prosody Example Configuration File 
-- 
-- If it wasn't already obvious, -- starts a comment, and all 
-- text after it on a line is ignored by Prosody.
--
-- The config is split into sections, a global section, and one 
-- for each defined host that we serve. You can add as many host 
-- sections as you like.
--
-- Lists are written { "like", "this", "one" } 
-- Lists can also be of { 1, 2, 3 } numbers, etc. 
-- Either commas, or semi-colons; may be used
-- as seperators.
--
-- A table is a list of values, except each value has a name. An 
-- example would be:
--
-- logging = { type = "html", directory = "/var/logs", rotate = "daily" }
--
-- Whitespace (that is tabs, spaces, line breaks) is mostly insignificant, so 
-- can 
-- be placed anywhere
-- that 	you deem fitting.
--
-- Tip: You can check that the syntax of this file is correct when you have finished
-- by running: luac -p prosody.cfg.lua
-- If there are any errors, it will let you know what and where they are, otherwise it 
-- will keep quiet.
--
-- The only thing left to do is rename this file to remove the .dist ending, and fill in the 
-- blanks. Good luck, and happy Jabbering!

				"dialback"; -- s2s dialback support
			  	"disco"; -- Service discovery
			
			-- Not essential, but recommended
				"private"; -- Private XML storage (for room bookmarks, etc.)
				"vcard"; -- Allow users to set vCards
			
			-- Nice to have
				"legacyauth"; -- Legacy authentication. Only used by some old clients and bots.
				"version"; -- Replies to server version requests
			  	"uptime"; -- Report how long server has been running
			  	"time"; -- Let others know the time here on this server
				"pep"; -- Enables users to publish their mood, activity, playing music and more
			  	"ping"; -- Replies to XMPP pings with pongs

			-- Other specific functionality
				--"register"; -- Allow users to register on this server using a client
				"posix"; -- POSIX functionality, sends server to background, enables syslog, etc.
			  	--"console"; -- telnet to port 5582 (needs console_enabled = true)
				--"bosh"; -- Enable BOSH clients, aka "Jabber over HTTP"
				--"httpserver"; -- Serve static files from a directory over HTTP
