Haskell XMPP (eXtensible Message Passing Protocol, a.k.a. Jabber) library

Unlike package network-protocol-xmpp, which uses libxml-sax, this library
uses HaXml and supports MUC. However, MUC support of the moment is worse
than that in package XMPP.

This library make extensive use of STM and threads to simplify writing
message-handling code.
