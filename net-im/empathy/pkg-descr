Empathy consists of a rich set of reusable instant messaging widgets, and a
GNOME client using those widgets. It uses Telepathy and Nokia's Mission Control,
and reuses Gossip's UI. The main goal is to permit desktop integration by
providing libempathy and libempathy-gtk libraries. libempathy-gtk is a set of
powerful widgets that can be embeded into any GNOME application.
