1. Minimum OS version.
======================

Skype is a Linux binary package that we run on FreeBSD via our Linux compat.

In order for Skype to work at all, you need to be running FreeBSD 11.0-CURRENT with
a Kernel and modules later than 2015-05-24.

The port tries to check for this, and determines your kernel's osversion.
Chances are, if your kernel isn't new enough, the installation will fail.

So in case of any trouble please make
sure you run kernel/modules built from sources after above dates.
Tests were only done on HEAD with linux CentOS 6, and it's certainly broken
with Fedora 10 (legacy).


2. Sound
========

Since the OSS interface was removed, Skype now uses linux-pulseaudio compat packages.
By default you get one device corresponding to your default OSS dsp device (so
Skype will use it for ringing, incoming voice and mic).
For this to function properly, we've sourced a very specific libpulse.so, which
implements most of the things Skype actually needs through OSS, and not much
else. And that's okay, as libpulse.so is used exclusively for Skype via
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and nothing else.

Chances are, if you want to use Skype 4.3 *and* something that actually
requires (Linux) PulseAudio, you'll be better off running Linux natively.


3. Video
========

3.1. Receiving video
--------------------
Should work out of the box. Please make sure you have
Options --> Video Devices --> Enable Skype Video  checked.

3.2. Sending video
------------------
Skype uses /dev/videoX (usually /dev/video0). This device node is created by
the drivers for your webcam (eg. multimedia/webcamd). If you selected the VIDEO
option (default) multimedia/webcamd will be pulled in.

First please make sure your webcam works with the drivers webcamd provides; you
can use multimedia/pwcview's pwcview(1) to check that you get a good image from
your webcam; if you get a good image, you will get video in Skype also.

It also uses v4l2 interface hence you very likely need to have linux_v4l2wrapper
kernel module (which you either have in base on recent HEAD or the port will
install for you); you need to load the module before stating Skype:
# kldload linux_v4l2wrapper
To make it permanent you can:
# echo 'linux_v4l2wrapper_load="YES"' >> /boot/loader.conf


4. SMSes
========

You can send SMSes with this version (provided you have Skype credit, of course).
Check Options --> SMS for details.


5. Screen sharing
=================

You should be able to receive and send once you have enabled Skype Video (check
ยง3)


6. Skype Access
===============

Doesn't work and it is likely not very probable it  will ever work since it
uses a lot of Linux-specific things.


7. Troubleshooting
==================

If Skype coredumps after displaying a (grey) About screen, you need to mount
linprocfs.

# mount -t linprocfs linprocfs /compat/linux/proc

To persist the changes, add it to your fstab.
This should work:

linprocfs	/compat/linux/proc	linprocfs	rw,late	0	0


8. Problems and bug reports
===========================

First of all, please understand that this is a closed, binary Linux application
that makes use for some more-or-less cutting edge Linux features/interfaces,
etc. As such, making it work on FreeBSD is mainly a question of keeping our
Linuxulator as close as possible to the Linux kernel, and our Linux compat
ports up to date.

When reporting problems at very least we need to know the output of:
$ uname -a; sysctl compat.linux | head -2; grep OVERRIDE_LINUX_ /etc/make.conf
the Skype version you are using, and hardware details (eg. webcam) if related.
