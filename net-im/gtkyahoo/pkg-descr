This is GTK-based client for Yahoo! Messenger.  This client is far superior,
imho, to the Java client, which can not be invoked by apprunner, and whose DNS
seems frequently broken.

The first time you run this program it will create a config file and ask you
to edit it.  Enter your Yahoo user ID and password in the config file, run
gtkyahoo again and you're online.
