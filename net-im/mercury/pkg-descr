Mercury is a Java Based MSN client.

With Mercury you can do the same things as with your normal messenger:
    * Talk to friends
    * Change your nickname and status
    * Add a display picture (also know as avatar)
    * Send files through the MSN server (for people with a firewall etc..) or
	direct
    * Away messages, if you are online, busy or whatever you can always have
	 an away message.
    * Play games (Tic Tac Toe and Connect4 only at the moment)
    * Watch the webcam of your friends (Mercury auto-saves these sessions on
	 the disk and can convert them to Quicktime movies)
    * Allow other people to watch your webcam (= video only)
    * Audio and Video conference is implemented (both sending and receiving)
	but still a beta feature

Mercury also has some MSN7 specific features, and some additional features that
your normal messenger doesn't have, for example: port forwarding for faster file
transfer, handling of more accounts, having different MSN names for each
contact, etc.
