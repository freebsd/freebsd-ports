1. Minimum OS version.

Skype is a Linux binary package that we run on FreeBSD via our Linux compat.
In order for Skype to work OK, you need your kernel and modules to be:
- post 2011-05-03 in on HEAD
- post 2011-05-08 in on 7,8-STABLE
The port tries to check for this, but there is a smaller or bigger interval for
which this can't be done automatically. So in case of any trouble please make
sure you run kernel/modules built from sources after above dates.
Tests were only done on HEAD and 8-STABLE with linux-fc10, and I don't think it
can work with fc4.


2. Sound

Since the OSS interface was removed, Skype now uses linux-alsa compat packages.
By default you get one device corresponding to your default OSS dsp device (so
Skype will use it for ringing, incoming voice and mic). If that doesn't suit
needs, you can map the other dsp devices for example by editing
/compat/linux/etc/alsa/pcm/pcm-oss.conf. You need to (re)start Skype after you
edit this file in order to get Skype pick up the changes.
Adding the following to the stock file, and then starting Skype and choosing
in Options-->Sound Devices:   Speakers: oss1
will let you use the second dsp (usually the front panel connectors for your
headphones, while still hearing the call ringing and other notification on the
first dsp device (presumably the one you connect your speakers to).
pcm.oss1 {
        type oss
        device /dev/dsp1
        hint {
                description "Open Sound System"
        }
}

ctl.oss1 {
        type oss
        device /dev/mixer1
        hint {
                description "Open Sound System"
        }
}


3. Video

3.1. Receiving video
Should work out of the box. Please make sure you have
Options --> Video Devices --> Enable Skype Video checked.

3.2. Sending video
Skype uses /dev/videoX (usually /dev/video0). This device node is created by
the drivers for your webcam (eg. multimedia/webcamd). If you selected the VIDEO
option (default) multimedia/webcamd will be pulled in.
First please make sure your webcam works with the drivers webcamd provides; you
can use multimedia/pwcview's pwcview(1) to check that you get a good image from
your webcam; if you get a good image, you will get video in Skype also.

It also uses v4l2 interface hence you very likely need to have linux_v4l2wrapper
kernel module (which you either have in base on recent HEAD or the port will
install for you); you need to load the module before stating Skype:
# kldload linux_v4l2wrapper
To make it permanent you can:
# echo 'linux_v4l2wrapper_load="YES"' >> /boot/loader.conf


4. SMSes

You can send SMSes with this version (provided you have Skype credit, of course).
Check Options --> SMS for details.


5. Screen sharing

You should be able to receive and send.
Please make sure you have Options --> Video Devices --> Enable Skype Video
checked to use this feature (yes, even if you don't use video).


6. Skype Access

Doesn't work and it is likely not very probable it  will ever work since it
uses a lot of Linux-specific things.


7. Next version ...

.. is in net-im/skype-devel. It probably works worse that this version. Use it
at your own risk.


8. Problems and bug reports

First of all, please understand that this is a closed, binary Linux application
that makes use for some more-or-less cutting edge Linux features/interfaces,
etc. As such, making it work on FreeBSD is mainly a question of keeping our
linuxulator as close as possible to the Linux kernel, and our Linux compat
ports up to date.

When reporting problems at very least we need to know the output of:
$ uname -a; sysctl compat.linux | head -2; grep OVERRIDE_LINUX_ /etc/make.conf
the skype version you are using, and hardware details (eg. webcam) if related.
