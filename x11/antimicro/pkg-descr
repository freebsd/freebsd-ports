AntiMicro is a graphical program used to map keyboard keys and mouse controls
to a gamepad. This program is useful for playing PC games using a gamepad
that do not have any form of built-in gamepad support. However,
you can use this program to control any desktop application with a gamepad;
this means that your system has to be running an X environment in order to
run this program.
