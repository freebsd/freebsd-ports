************************************************************

The GNOME 3 desktop Lite edition has been successfully installed.

The Lite edition only includes the minimal components to get a working GNOME 3
Desktop. The user then has to install prefered applications like editor,
web browser or e-mail client. If you wish to install the full desktop, you can
remove this port, and install the x11/gnome3 port or package.  That can be best
accomplished using the following commands:

# pkg_delete gnome3-lite
# cd /usr/ports/x11/gnome3
# make install clean

Alternatively, you can install additional GNOME components individually
using either their ports or packages.

For more help on using GNOME on FreeBSD, please see the FreeBSD GNOME project
site at http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome.
