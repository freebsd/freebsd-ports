xtermcontrol enables dynamic control of xterm properties. It makes
it easy to change colors, titles, fonts, and the geometry of a
running xterm, as well as to report the current settings of the
properties. Window manipulations such as (de)iconify, raise and
lower, maximize and restore, and reset are also supported. It also
lets advanced users issue any xterm control sequence.
