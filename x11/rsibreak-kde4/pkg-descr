Repetitive Strain Injury is an illness which can occur as a result of
working with a mouse and keyboard. This utility can be used to remind
you to take a break now and then. It will show you a random picture
from a collection you can configure yourself for a configurable duration
at a configurable interval.

You can use these breaks to do some stretch exercises for example, or as
a reminder to walk away from the computer for a while.

RSIBreak will sit in your system tray and when it is time for a break it
will show you the picture full screen. All timings can be set by clicking
with the right mouse button on the icon in the system tray.
