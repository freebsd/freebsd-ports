What is xcb?
============
Do you ever wish you could cut two or more separate pieces of text
at once from a window?  Do you ever need to save the output from one
command for reuse in several subsequent tasks?  Do you ever find
yourself wanting some easy means of globally exporting data, e.g.
to a parent shell, to another xterm or application, or to another
machine or user?  If you answer yes to any of these questions, then
xcb is for you.

Xcb provides access to the cut buffers built into every X server.
It allows the buffers to be manipulated either via the command line,
or with the mouse in a point and click manner.  The buffers can be
used as holding pens to store and retrieve arbitrary data fragments,
so any number of different pieces of data can be saved and recalled later.
The program is designed primarily for use with textual data.


What is so good about this release?
===================================
Release 2.3 fixes a bug found in the XView code that prevented data
from being pasted from xcb to XView applications such as cmdtool.

The release also adds a Motif GUI, selectable as a compile-time option.
Now you can choose between the Athena or the Motif look and feel.
