wdm -- WINGs Display Manager

wdm was initially called DisplayMaker.

This is a modification of XFree86's xdm package for graphically
handling authentication and system login.  Most of xdm has been
preserved (XFree86 3.3.2.3) with the Login interface based on a WINGs
implementation using Tom Rothamel's "external greet" interface.
