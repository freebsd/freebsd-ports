The appmenu-gtk-module is a GTK Module that strips menus from all GTK
programs, converts to them MenuModel and send to them AppMenu
(sometimes called a global menu bar) of a desktop environment like
Plasma or Gnome. This module was originally used in Ubuntu's Unity
Desktop Environment, but it lives on as part of the Vala project.
