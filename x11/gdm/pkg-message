GDM is installed.

Do _NOT_ use /etc/ttys to start gdm at boot time.  This will result in gdm
hanging or restarting constantly. Instead, add gdm_enable="YES" to
/etc/rc.conf. GDM will be started automatic on the next reboot.

If Gnomekeyring/PAM integration was choosen, the keyring can be automatically
unlocked if:

1) the password protecting it is the same as the password user 
2) and the following directives using pam_gnome_keyring are added
   to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/pam.d/gdm-password:

	auth		include		system
	....
	auth		optional	${LOCALBASE}/lib/pam_gnome_keyring.so

	session		include		system
	....
	session		optional	${LOCALBASE}/lib/pam_gnome_keyring.so auto_start

It is recommended to put thouse directives at least after the system directives.
