Dynamic menu library and client program inspired by dmenu, a
minimalistic menu that reads a newline separated list of items from
stdin and shows them as a menu on the top of the screen.  When the
user selects one item or types any text and presses Enter, their
choice is printed to stdout.

Bemenu comes with Ncurses, Wayland, and X11 backends.
