KDE is a powerful Free Software graphical desktop environment for Linux
and Unix workstations.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-port" that depends on other KDE packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the KDE stuff pulled in by the port/package dependency mechanism.

x11/kde4 contains the legacy KDE desktop and applications.
