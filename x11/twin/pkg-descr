Twin is a text-mode window environment. It turns a text terminal 
into a X11-style display with window manager, terminal windows, and 
can also serve as display for remote applications. Each terminal 
window provides the functions of a text-mode Linux console. Twin 
runs on X11, libggi, itself, the Linux console, and any 
termcap/ncurses-compatible tty. It supports multiple simultaneous 
displays, and can attach/detach each display on the fly.
