xrootconsole is a small utility which displays its input in a transparent
text box on X's root window.  It will read from any file listed on the
command line or, by default, from stdin.  It is most useful when it reads
from a FIFO; this allows you to redirect multiple commands to the FIFO
and monitor their output.
