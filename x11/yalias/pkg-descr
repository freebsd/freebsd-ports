yalias has a window with two buttons and a text widget. The left
button clears the widget (and is bound to the Escape key). The right
button matches the contents of the widget against a series of regular
expressions that the user has previously specified in their
$HOME/.yaliasrc, and executes the specified command if it matches
any of them.
