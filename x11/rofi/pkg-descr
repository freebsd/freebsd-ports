A popup window switcher roughly based on superswitcher, requiring only xlib
and pango. This version started off as a clone of simpleswitcher, the
version from Sean Pringle. All credit for this great tool should go to him.
Rofi developed extra features, like a run-dialog, ssh-launcher and can
act as a drop-in dmenu replacement, making it a very versatile tool.
