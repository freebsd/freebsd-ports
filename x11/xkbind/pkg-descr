XkbInd program (X Keyboard Extension Indicator) is a minimal indicator of
keyboard layout (XKB group) for the X Window System; it outputs information
about current keyboard layout attached to each top-level window through
their captions via prefixes to original title strings.  It also allows to
simulate an independent keyboard layout for each handled window and works
with most of the window managers.
