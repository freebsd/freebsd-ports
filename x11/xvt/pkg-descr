xvt - an xterm replacement, supporting color, transparency, and more,
with less!

xvt, simply continues on the original authors work -- John Bovey, University
of Kent at Canterbury. With few exceptions, it does everything Xterm does.
But also does a great deal more, with less overhead. This version will also
leverage vt(4), FreeBSD's new console driver. Which replaces syscons(4).
