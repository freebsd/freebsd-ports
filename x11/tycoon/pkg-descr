   The program adds nicely shaped icons a little bit like those of window
manager. You can launch programs by clicking on them. The layout of the icons
is remembered and restored on the next run.

 Right now I have put into tycoon support for OffiX drag-and-drop,
so now you can drag icons from the OffiX filemanager into tycoon
icons and have appropriate action invoked. Check out OffiX, it's
very fine package.
