The Lumina Desktop Environment is a lightweight system interface that is
designed for use on any Unix-like operating system. It takes a
plugin-based approach, allowing the entire interface to be assembled or
arranged by each individual user as desired, with a system-wide default
layout which can be customized by the system administrator. This allows
every system (or user session) to be designed to maximize the individual
user's productivity.

This meta-package installs all the packages related to the Lumina desktop.
If you want more fine-grained control over the installed utilities, please
install the individual x11/lumina-* and deskutils/lumina-* packages instead.
