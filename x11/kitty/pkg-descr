Kitty is the fast, featureful, GPU based terminal emulator.

kitty is designed for power keyboard users. To that end all its controls work
with the keyboard (although it fully supports mouse interactions as well). Its
configuration is a simple, human editable, single file for easy reproducibility
(I like to store configuration in source control).
kitty is designed from the ground up to support all modern terminal
features, such as unicode, true color, bold/italic fonts, text formatting, etc.
It even extends existing text formatting escape codes, to add support for
features not available elsewhere, such as colored and styled (curly) underlines.
