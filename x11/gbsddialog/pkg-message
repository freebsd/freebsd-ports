  message: <<EOM
This package also installs a desktop application file for bsdconfig(8),
FreeBSD's system configuration tool, for operation as a graphical
interface (starting with -X) as permitted with xdialog(1) as helper tool.
However, for proper operation this requires either running as the root user, or
sudo(8) to be installed and the user to be allowed in the sudoers(5) file.
