gbsddialog is an implementation of bsddialog, a text-based user interface to be
used in scripts and tools, such as in the official FreeBSD installer,
bsdinstall(8).

However, gbsddialog uses Gtk+ dialogs and widgets instead of console-based
equivalents.

The objective is to reproduce the same behaviour as the original tool,
respecting the exact command-line parameters and output. gbsddialog can then be
used as a drop-in replacement to bsddialog, effectively granting the possibility
to install and configure FreeBSD entirely in graphical mode.

In addition, an implementation of Xdialog is also provided, for use with
bsdconfig(8) when invoked in graphical mode with -S or -X.
