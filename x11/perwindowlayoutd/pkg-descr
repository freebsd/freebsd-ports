Sometimes you want to setup switching keyboard layouts using X11 server --
because there is no DE plugin, or it's broken, or lacks needed functionality.
You can easily configure X11 server to switch keyboard layouts, but I could
not find way of keeping layout for each window separately using only the X11
server.  Hence this package.  It is similar to kbdd and xxkb but might work
better under some configurations and/or window managers.
