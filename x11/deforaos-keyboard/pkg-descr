This program emulates a physical keyboard by providing a virtual interface on
screen. It currently supports four modes:
 * docked, where it will occupy the bottom of the screen;
 * popup, likewise as a popup window;
 * windowed, where it can be found in the system tray (the default)
 * embedded, which outputs its window ID for inclusion within another program.

Additionally, it can be piloted through its companion tool, desktopctl(1).
