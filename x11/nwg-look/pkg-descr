Nwg-look is a GTK settings editor, designed to work properly in
wlroots-based Wayland environment. The look and feel is strongly
influenced by LXAppearance, but nwg-look is intended to free the user
from a few inconveniences:

- It works natively on Wayland. You no longer need Xwayland, nor
  strange env variables for it to run.
- It applies gsettings directly, with no need to use workarounds. You
  don't need to set gsettings in the sway config file. You don't need
  the "import-gsettings" script.
