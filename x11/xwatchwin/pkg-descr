xwatchwin allows you to peek at a window on another X server. 
To use it, you must specify the display name of the machine you want
to watch, then the name of the window on that machine. 
Xwatchwin will attempt to connect with the X server
hostname:0.0, and if successful, will try to retrieve a copy of
the window in which you specified interest.

You may specify the window you want to watch either by name or by its
window id, usually a hexidecimal number.  Usually specifying the
window by name is simpler, although not all windows have names
associated with them; in that case you must use the window id option.

If the window you want to watch is not in a viewable state,
xwatchwin will tell you so and exit.  If while you are watching
a window it becomes 'unviewable', xwatchwin will wait until the
window becomes 'viewable' again.

xwatchwin was written as an aid to a class for people learning
to use X.  The idea is that the instructor would type into an xterm
window on his/her display and the students would use xwatchwin
to see what the instructor typed.  The students could then type the
same thing in their own terminal windows.  Hopefully others will find
equally (if not more) constructive uses.
