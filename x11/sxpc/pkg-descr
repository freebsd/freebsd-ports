The Simple X Protocol Compressor

This program provides compression of the X protocol stream.
It is intended to be used to improve the performance of X applications
over a slow internet connection.  (e.g. slip,cslip. or term)  It assumes
a Unix operating system at  both ends of the link.  Transferring large
bitmaps or images through sxpc may be slower than not using it.
The algorithms used are geared primarily for the data exchanged
during interactive use where the same data may be sent several times
with only small changes.  (e.g. editing)

 WARNING WARNING  DANGER DANGER
 If you use this program use xauth to provide SECURITY, since
 host-based security will be BYPASSED.   See README.xauth in the work
 sub-directory.
