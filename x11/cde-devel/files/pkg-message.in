CDE - The Common Desktop Environment is an X Windows desktop environment
that was commonly used on commercial UNIX variants such as Sun Solaris,
HP-UX, and IBM AIX. Developed between 1993 and 1999, it has now been
released under an Open source license by The Open Group.

Common Desktop Environment requires the Subprocess Control Service,
dtcms, and the inetd super server to fully function.

First, add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf:

dtspc	stream	tcp	nowait	root	 %%PREFIX%%/dt/bin/dtspcd	%%PREFIX%%/dt/bin/dtspcd

Second, add the following line to /etc/services:

dtspc		6112/tcp # CDE Subprocess Control Service

# sysrc rpcbind_enable=YES
# sysrc dtcms_enable=YES
# sysrc inetd_enable=YES
# service rpcbind start && service dtcms start && service inetd start

Finally, make sure to add %%PREFIX%%/dt/bin to your path.

To start the Common Desktop Environment:
% env LANG=C startx %%PREFIX%%/dt/bin/Xsession

Alternatively, if you want to use the Login Manager as well, create
%%LOCALBASE%%/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config and add this line:

allowed_users=anybody

To start the Common Desktop Enviroment Login Manager:

% %%LOCALBASE%%/dt/bin/dtlogin -daemon
