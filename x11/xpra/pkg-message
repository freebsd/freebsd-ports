x11/xpra install note:

Requirements for sound forwarding:
* a client with sound output of any kind (even virtual)
* a server with pulseaudio installed (for going beyond the simple test step)
* users must be "pulseaudio-enabled" - whatever that means in terms of
      permissions and user setup (policy, user group, etc)

The runtime dependency on pulseaudio has been dropped from this port since it
is strictly optional at runtime. If you want to forward sound from the server,
then pulseaudio must be installed and configured for use. Pulseaudio is
supported for client side but not required for any feature to function.
