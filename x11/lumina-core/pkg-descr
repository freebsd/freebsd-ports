The Lumina Desktop Environment is a lightweight system interface that is 
designed for use on any Unix-like operating system. It takes a 
plugin-based approach, allowing the entire interface to be assembled or
arranged by each individual user as desired, with a system-wide default 
layout which can be customized by the system administrator. This allows 
every system (or user session) to be designed to maximize the individual 
user's productivity.
