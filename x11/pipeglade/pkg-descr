Pipeglade is a helper program that displays graphical user interfaces
for other programs.  It renders the GUI definition found in a
GtkBuilder file (created using the Glade Interface Designer), and
communicates with the main program solely via pipes or fifos.

To have its GUI rendered by pipeglade, a program must be able to
 - send plain text commands to standard output or a named pipe and/or
 - receive and parse simple plain text messages from standard input or
 a named pipe.

Simple one-shot dialogs as well as more complex, long-running programs
can be built.

Pipeglade provides access to a subset of the features available in
GTK+ 3.  Widgets able to communicate via pipeglade include text labels
and images, statusbars and progress indicators, various kinds of
buttons, spinbuttons and scales/sliders, comboboxes and menus, various
text and tabular inputs, various standard dialog windows, calendars,
drawing areas.
