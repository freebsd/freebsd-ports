This little program lets you change your Gtk+ 2.0 theme. The aim is to
make theme preview and selection as slick as possible. Themes installed
on the system are presented for selection and previewed on the fly. For
a comprehensive demonstration there's a large variety of widgets.

It was originally derived from Gtk Theme Switch, but what started out as
a hack to remove various nuisances now shares no code whatsoever anymore
with the original.
