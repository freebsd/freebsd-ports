The KDE Frameworks build on the Qt framework, providing everything from simple
utility classes (such as those in KCoreAddons) to integrated solutions for
common requirements of desktop applications (such as KNewStuff, for fetching
downloadable add-on content in an application, or the powerful KIO
multi-protocol file access framework).
