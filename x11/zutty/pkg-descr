Zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally
similar to several other X terminal emulators such as xterm, rxvt
and countless others. It is also similar to other, much more modern,
GPU-accelerated terminal emulators such as Alacritty and Kitty.
What really sets Zutty apart is its radically simple, yet extremely
efficient rendering implementation, coupled with a sufficiently
complete feature set to make it useful for a wide range of users.
Zutty offers high throughput with low latency, and strives to conform
to relevant (published or de-facto) standards.
