XBellD is a small daemon for replacing the standard X Window
System terminal bell with a more interesting set of sounds.
This is useful for systems where the terminal bell is handled
by the "PC Speaker," or where different sounds are desired for
different classes of X clients.

XBellD works by intercepting terminal bell requests on the
server side, and then playing user-specified sounds through a
PCM capable soundcard. The resource class of the client making
a terminal bell request is used to match a corresponding sound
file which should be played when such a request is made.
