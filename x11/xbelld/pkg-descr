XBellD is a small daemon for replacing the standard X Window 
System terminal bell with a more interesting set of sounds. 
This is useful for systems where the terminal bell is handled 
by the "PC Speaker," or where different sounds are desired for
different classes of X clients.

XBellD works by intercepting terminal bell requests on the 
server side, and then playing user-specified sounds through a 
PCM capable soundcard. The resource class of the client making 
a terminal bell request is used to match a corresponding sound 
file which should be played when such a request is made.
