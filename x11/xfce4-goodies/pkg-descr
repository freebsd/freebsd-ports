The Xfce Goodies Project includes additional software and artwork that are
related to the Xfce desktop, but not part of the official release.

The Xfce Project itself provides a lightweight desktop environment, which
includes only the core compoments required for a desktop environment, like a
window manager, a file manager, a session manager, a panel and a few utilities.
Additional software packages and plugins to existing software, like the panel
or the file manager, are provided by the Xfce Goodies Project.

This meta-port does not install any software itself - it simply depends on other
ports which are part of the Xfce Goodies Project, and a few additional ports
which are not officially part of Goodies, but highly recommended for an Xfce
desktop environment.
