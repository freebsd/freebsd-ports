Wayout takes text from standard input and outputs it to a desktop-widget
on Wayland desktops. Periodic updates are supported; e.g. newline-separated
input or any other delimiter of choice. We call this a feed. The desktop
widget can be shown either on top (OSD-like functionality) or below other
windows.

A Wayland compositor must implement the Layer-Shell and XDG-Output for wayout
to work.

Features:
- Allow updating from standard input at a regular interval; custom delimiters
- Configurable colours/border/position/fonts
- Supports the pango markup language for text markup/colours.
