Konsole is a terminal program for KDE.

As well as being a standalone program, it is also used by other KDE
programs such as the Kate editor and KDevelop development environment
to provide easy access to a terminal window. Konsole's features and
usage are explained and illustrated in the Konsole handbook, which can
be accessed by browsing to "help:/konsole" in Konqueror.
