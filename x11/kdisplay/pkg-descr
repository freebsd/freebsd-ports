KDisplay is a small display management app. It provides a simple and
straightforward UI for managing an arbitrary number of displays.

Features:
* Displays can be repositioned with drag-and-drop.
* An optimal resolution and refresh rate are automatically selected.
  Manual override is possible.
* Displays can be seemlessly "replicated".
* The settings of a display is by default remembered globally
  but can be overridden for specific combinations of displays.
* Provides additional integration for the KDE Plasma Workspace through
  a plasmoid and an OSD activated by hardware key for quick
  configuration changes.
