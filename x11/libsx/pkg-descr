Libsx is a library of code that sits on top of and to the side of the
Athena widget set.  Its purpose is to make writing X applications
*much* easier.  To accomplish this, libsx encapsulates a large
portion of the uglier details that arise while programming in X and
it fills in some gaps that exist with the Athena Widget set (such as
a widget for drawing graphics); libsx tries to simplify the common
case down to a single function call with only a few arguments.
