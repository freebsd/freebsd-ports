xidle uses the XScreenSaver(3) extension to receive inactivity events
when a timeout is specified, running a specific program after the elapsed
time.  xidle also monitors the very corner of the given position for
pointer activity and runs a program if the pointer sits there for more
than the specified number of seconds.  This behavior is always present,
whether -timeout is specified or not.
