A minimalist scheduler for your status line scripts.

i3blocks executes your command lines and generates a status line from their
output. Commands are scheduled at configured time intervals, upon signal
reception or on clicks.

The generated line is meant to be displayed by the i3 window manager
through its i3bar component, as an alternative to i3status.

i3blocks is meant to be highly flexible but intuitive. No library package
is required, just output what your status bar expects, from your favorite
programming language and your preferred format.
