  hosts, with native mouse and scrollback

  Shift-Insert (bracketed paste is supported!)

  (most other terminal emulators do not support as many render
  attributes)
- Configuration via a file with hot reloading

- Splits/Panes
- Tabs (Hotkey: Super-T, next/prev: Super-[ and Super-], go-to: Super-[1-9])
- SSH client with native tabs
