======================================================================

To enable KDE Display Manager (KDM), add kdm4_enable="YES" to
rc.conf(5). To get full functionality you also need procfs(5) mounted.

If sysutils/upower is installed, backlight management support requires
acpi_video(4) to be loaded.
