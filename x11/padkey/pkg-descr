BSD PadKey is a small program for FreeBSD that sends keys to your X display 
according to which buttons are being pressed on a modified SNES pad connected 
to the parallel port. 

In short, PadKey allows you to play games on FreeBSD with an authentic SNES 
controller.

Note: This version only works with ONE pad connected to the parallel port!
