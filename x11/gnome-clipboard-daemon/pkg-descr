GNOME Clipboard Daemon is a program that keeps the content of your X clipboard
in memory, so the clipboard will not get lost even after you close the
application from which you copied. It is a daemon - it has no GUI. You start
it and it will run in the background and Just Work(tm).

Example:
	1. Start AbiWord.
	2. Type in 'hello world'. Select everything and click Copy.
	3. Close AbiWord.
	4. Start gedit.
	5. Click Paste. Normally nothing will happen. But if GNOME Clipboard
	   Daemon is running, pasting will work.
