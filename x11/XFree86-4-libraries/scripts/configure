 MIT supplies an authentication mechanism that relies upon DES, this is
 called XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1.

 Source code for this authentication mechanism may not be exported from
 the United States, however, there are compatible replacements for this
 mechanism available elsewhere.  Also, while this scheme is not used for
 general purpose encryption,  some countries restrict the use of strong
 cryptography.

 If you have aquired a copy of "Wraphelp.c" and it currently resides in
 the same location as the XFree86 source or in the ports "files"
 subdirectory,  it will be copied into the right place in the X11 source
 distribution and support for this feature will be enabled if you answer
 YES to the following question.

 If you do not have a copy of this file, even if you answer YES to this
 question, support will not be enabled.  If you wish to change this later,
 the option controling this is contained the file xc/config/cf/xf86site.def.

 when they log in. This requires that you have Kerberos on your system
 when you do this build.

 mechanism available elsewhere.  Also, while this scheme is not used for
 general purpose encryption,  some countries restrict the use of strong
