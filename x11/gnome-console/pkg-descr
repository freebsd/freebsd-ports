Console is a minimal terminal for GNOME

Console is supposed to be a simple terminal emulator for the average user
to carry out simple cli tasks and aims to be a ‘core’ app for GNOME/Phosh.

We are not however trying to replace GNOME Terminal/Tilix, these advanced
tools are great for developers and administrators, rather Console aims to
serve the casual linux user who rarely needs a terminal
