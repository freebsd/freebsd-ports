This distribution contains two programs, xrsh and xrlogin.

Xrsh is designed to allow you to start an X client on a remote machine
with the window displayed on the current server's $DISPLAY.  It has
many options that give you the ability to propagate environment
variables (including DISPLAY) to the remote system and works with
various types of X server access control including xauth and xhost.

Xrlogin opens a local xterm window and runs rlogin or telnet to
connect to a remote machine.
