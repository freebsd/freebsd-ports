This is ancient software that is ported for curiosity purposes.  It is
unlikely to be useful in everyday use, and should not be used in untrusted
environments as there are highly likely to be unresolved security issues.

It is also necessary to enable the Subprocess Control Service (and dtcms for
the calendar to work).

# sysrc rpcbind_enable=yes
# sysrc dtcms_enable=yes
# sysrc inetd_enable=yes
# service rpcbind start && service dtcms start

and

Add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf:

dtspc	stream	tcp	nowait	root	 %%PREFIX%%/dt/bin/dtspcd	%%PREFIX%%/dt/bin/dtspcd

and to /etc/services:

dtspc		6112/tcp # CDE Subprocess Control Service

To start the Common Desktop Environment,
% ln -s %%PREFIX%%/dt/bin/Xsession ~/.Xsession
% env LANG=C startx

If you want to use dtlogin as well, you'll need to create
%%LOCALBASE%%/etc/X11/Xwrapper.config and add this line:

Also, make sure to add %%PREFIX%%/dt/bin to your path.
