Some options could need manual change to ~/.config/xfce4/terminal/terminalrc:

To reduce the height of tabs, add the hidden 'MiscSlimTabs' option:

MiscSlimTabs=TRUE

By default this option is not defined.

If you have configured a custom color cursor you will also need to add:

ColorCursorUseDefault=FALSE

to have such configuration still working, otherwise reconfigure the color
in the GUI.

Keep in mind, when you change an option in Preferences window, this file
is overwritten.
