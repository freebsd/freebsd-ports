cliphist is clipboard history "manager" for wayland

- write clipboard changes to a history file
- recall history with dmenu / rofi / wofi (or whatever other picker you like)
- both text and images are supported
- clipboard is preserved byte-for-byte
  - leading / trailing whitespace / no whitespace or newlines are
    preserved
  - won't break fancy editor selections like vim wordwise, linewise,
    block mode
- no concept of a picker, only pipes
