FSPanel is a panel for Linux/Unix that lists all your open windows.  It
lets you iconify and bring windows to front. FSPanel is tiny, less than
10k on i386-linux. It does require a gnome compliant window manager
though (eg. Enlightenment, SawFish, WindowMaker, IceWM). Basically it's
a tiny, lame, featureless panel.
 
FSPanel does NOT and probably will never have any:
  * program launchers
  * menus
  * applets
