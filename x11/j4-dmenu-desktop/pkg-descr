j4-dmenu-desktop is a replacement for i3-dmenu-desktop. It's purpose is to find
.desktop files and offer you a menu to start an application using dmenu. Since
r2.7 j4-dmenu-desktop doesn't require i3wm anymore and should work just fine on
about any desktop environment.

You can also execute shell commands using it.
