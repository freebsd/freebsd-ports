Login.app is a graphical login program that will give you a nice looking login
interface to your favorite X-Server. It will also make it easy for you to
reboot or halt your system. It has support for themes, so you can easily
change the look of the login panel.

PLEASE NOTE: Login.app is not a display manager and does not try to be.
Login.app is only a fast and nice looking graphical login panel that let's you
login on your system (you could say it's a graphical version of /bin/login).
Also, it does have some nice features to halt, reboot and suspend you system.
It will serve the needs of most users that just want a nice looking login
interface on their FreeBSD workstation.
