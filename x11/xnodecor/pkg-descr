This program sets attribute "override_redirect" to True for any window
you've specified (using window name). Window Managers should ignore
such windows; it's useful, for example, if you're using wmx Window Manager,
and want to have a clock on every virtual screen and without any
borders. Just add the following string to your X-startfile (after
starting watch app):

  xnodecor -w watch

(assuming that your watch application has a window named "watch")
