A small drop-down terminal for i3wm and sway, supporting your preferred
terminal emulator, is multi-monitor and screen-width aware, and plays
with dmenu, rofil, and more.

When launched, it will minimize the quickterm on the current screen if
there is one. Otherwise, it will either prompt the user for the shell to
open or use the one supplied in argument.

If the requested shell is already opened on another screen, it will be
moved on the current screen.

It is recommended to map it to an i3 binding. See WWW for user config.
