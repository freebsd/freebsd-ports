kanshi allows you to define output profiles that are automatically
enabled and disabled on hotplug. For instance, this can be used to
turn a laptop's internal screen off when docked.

This is a Wayland equivalent for tools like autorandr. kanshi can be
used on Wayland compositors supporting the wlr-output-management
protocol.
