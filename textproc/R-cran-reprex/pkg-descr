Convenience wrapper that uses the 'rmarkdown' package to render small
snippets of code to target formats that include both code and output.

The goal is to encourage the sharing of small, reproducible, and runnable
examples on code-oriented websites, such as stackoverflow.com and
github.com, or in email.

The user's clipboard is the default source of input code and the default
target for rendered output. 'reprex' also extracts clean, runnable R code
from various common formats, such as copy/paste from an R session.
