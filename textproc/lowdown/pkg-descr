lowdown is just another Markdown translator. It can output traditional HTML or
a document for your troff type-setter of choice, such as groff(1), Heirloom
troff, or even mandoc(1). lowdown doesn't require XSLT, Python, or even Perl -
it's just clean, secure, open source C code with no dependencies. Its
canonical documentation is the lowdown(1) manpage.
