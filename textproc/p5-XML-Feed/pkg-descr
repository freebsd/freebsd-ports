XML::Feed is a syndication feed parser for both RSS and Atom feeds.
It also implements feed auto-discovery for finding feeds, given a URI.

XML::Feed supports the following syndication feed formats:

    * RSS 0.91
    * RSS 1.0
    * RSS 2.0
    * Atom

The goal of XML::Feed is to provide a unified API for parsing and using
the various syndication formats. The different flavors of RSS and Atom
handle data in different ways: date handling; summaries and content;
escaping and quoting; etc. This module attempts to remove those differences
by providing a wrapper around the formats and the classes implementing
those formats (XML::RSS and XML::Atom::Feed).
