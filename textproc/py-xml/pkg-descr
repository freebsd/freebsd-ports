From the website:

  The PyXML package is a collection of libraries to process XML with Python.
  It contains, among other things 

  - xmlproc: a validating XML parser
  - sgmlop:  a C helper module that can speed-up xmllib.py and sgmllib.py by
             a factor of 5
  - PySAX:   SAX 1 and SAX2 libraries with drivers for most of the parsers
  - 4DOM:    A fully compliant DOM Level 2 implementation 
  - javadom: An adapter from Java DOM implementations to the standard Python
             DOM binding
  - pulldom: a DOM implementation that supports lazy instantiation of nodes
  - marshal: a module with several options for serializing Python objects to
             XML, including WDDX and XML-RPC
  - unicode: a helper module for Python 1.5 users who need conversions
             between UTF-8 and ISO-8859-?
