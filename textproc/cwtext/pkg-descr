About the project

We plan to build a program that will accept ASCII text as input and generate
International Morse Code as output. The output formats can be:

     - . -..- - (text) on the console
     Raw audio on /dev/audio (8bit PCM data)
     .wav files
     .ogg or (proprietary format) compressed audio

International Morse Code

Supported character set includes [A-Za-z] (all downcased as Morse is not case
sensitive), [0-9], ",-.?/" plus a few procedural characters (SK, AR, BT etc).
