txt2html is a Perl program that converts plain text to HTML.

It supports headings, lists, simple character markup, and
hyperlinking, and is highly customizable. It recognizes some of the
apparent structure of the source document (mostly whitespace and
typographic layout), and attempts to mark that structure explicitly
using HTML.
