greple has almost the same function as Unix command egrep(1) but the
search is done in the manner similar to search engine.  greple also
search the pattern across the line boundaries. This is especially
useful to handle Asian multi-byte text. Japanese text can be separated
by newline almost any place of the text. So the search pattern may
spread out on multiple lines.
