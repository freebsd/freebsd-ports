python-glob2

This is an extended version of Python's builtin glob module
(http://docs.python.org/library/glob.html) which adds:

The ability to capture the text matched by glob patterns, and return those
matches alongside the filenames.  A recursive '**' globbing syntax, akin for
example to the globstar option of the bash shell.  The ability to replace the
filesystem functions used, in order to glob on virtual filesystems.  Compatible
with Python 2 and Python 3 (tested with 3.3).

It's currently based on the glob code from Python 3.3.1.
