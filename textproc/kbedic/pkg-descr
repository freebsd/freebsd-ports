	KBE Dictionary has been first written for Linux.
It resembles the popular dictionary SA Dictionary, but 
after some time it has developed into an independent project.
The words database of KBE Dictionary has been taken from the
database of Otto Dictionary and changed with the database of 
SA Dictionary. At the moment KBE Dictionary possesses maybe 
the largest Bulgarian-to-English and English-to-Bulgarian database.
 The abbreviation KBE is derived from the words - KDE Bulgarian
English. When we add dictionary, the name becomes kbedic. To 
use that program it is not necessary to have KDE installed,
only the Qt libraries are required.
 KBE dictionary has been written in C/C++ and has many
advantages and enhancements in comparison with the older 
versions - it works faster, the database contains more words 
and the bugs are less. There is also a console version of the
product called cbedic.
