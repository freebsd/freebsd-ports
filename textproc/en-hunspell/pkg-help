README file for English Hunspell dictionaries derived from SCOWL.

The following dictionaries are available:

  en_US (American)
  en_CA (Canadian)
  en_GB-ise (British with "ise" spelling)
  en_GB-ize (British with "ize" spelling)

  en_US-large
  en_CA-large
  en_GB-large (with both "ise" and "ize" spelling)

The normal (non-large) dictionaries correspond to SCOWL size 60 and,
to encourage consistent spelling, generally only include one spelling
variant for a word.  The large dictionaries correspond to SCOWL size
70 and may include multiple spelling for a word when both variants are
considered almost equal.  The larger dictionaries however (1) have not
been as carefully checked for errors as the normal dictionaries and
thus may contain misspelled or invalid words; and (2) contain
uncommon, yet valid, words that might cause problems as they are
likely to be misspellings of more common words (for example, "ort" and
"calender").

To get an idea of the difference in size, here are 25 random words
only found in the large dictionary for American English:

  Bermejo Freyr's Guenevere Hatshepsut Nottinghamshire arrestment
  crassitudes crural dogwatches errorless fetial flaxseeds godroon
  incretion jalape~no's kelpie kishkes neuroglias pietisms pullulation
  stemwinder stenoses syce thalassic zees
