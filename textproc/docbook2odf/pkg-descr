Docbook2odf is a toolkit that automatically converts DocBook to OASIS
OpenDocument (ODF, the ISO standardized format used for texts, spreadsheets
and presentations). Conversion is based on a XSLT which makes it easy to
convert DocBook->ODF, ODT, ODS and ODP as all these documents are XML based.

Also goal of docbook2odf is to generate well formatted documents in
OpenDocument, ready to be used in instant, with actually considering current
rules of the Corporate Identity of organizations. Final results should not be
restricted to text like documents but also many other forms could be generated,
like presentations, charts or forms with images and multimedia.

The result is provided in a one zipped ODF file (.odt/.odp/.ods) with all
required content. There are group of utilities like docbook2odt, docbook2ods
and docbook2odp as docbook2odf is actually universally converting to these
respective formats.
