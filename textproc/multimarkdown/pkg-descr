MultiMarkdown, or MMD, is a tool to help turn minimally marked-up plain
text into well formatted documents, including HTML, PDF (by way of
LaTeX), OPML, or OpenDocument (specifically, Flat OpenDocument or
'.fodt', which can in turn be converted into RTF, Microsoft Word, or
virtually any other word-processing format).

MMD is a superset of the Markdown syntax, originally created by John
Gruber. It adds multiple syntax features (tables, footnotes, and
citations, to name a few), in addition to the various output formats
listed above (Markdown only creates HTML). Additionally, it builds in
'smart' typography for various languages (proper left- and right-sided
quotes, for example).


NOTE: To use the mmd2pdf script, you must install print/latexmk.
