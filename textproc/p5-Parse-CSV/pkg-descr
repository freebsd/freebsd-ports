Surely the CPAN doesn't need yet another CSV parsing module.

Text::CSV_XS is the standard parser for CSV files. It is fast
as hell, but unfortunately it can be a bit verbose to use.

A number of other modules have attempted to put usability
wrappers around this venerable module, but they have all
focussed on parsing the entire file into memory at once.

This method is fine unless your CSV files start to get large.
Once that happens, the only existing option is to fall back
on the relatively slow and heavyweight XML::SAXDriver::CSV
module.

Parse::CSV fills this functionality gap. It provides a flexible
and light-weight streaming parser for large, extremely large,
or arbitrarily large CSV files.
