The Petal::Utils package contains commonly used Petal modifiers (or
plugins), and bundles them with an easy-to-use installation interface. By
default, a set of modifiers are installed into Petal when you use this
module. You can change which modifiers are installed by naming them after
the use statement:

  # use the default set:
  use Petal::Utils qw( :default );

  # use the date set of modifiers:
  use Petal::Utils qw( :date );

  # use only named modifiers, plus the debug set:
  use Petal::Utils qw( UpperCase Date :debug );

  # don't install any modifiers
  use Petal::Utils qw();

You'll find a list of plugin sets throughout this document. You can also
get a complete list by looking at the variable:

  %Petal::Utils::PLUGIN_SET;

For details on how the plugins are installed, see the "Advanced Petal"
section of the Petal documentation.
