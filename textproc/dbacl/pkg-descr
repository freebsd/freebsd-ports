dbacl is a digramic Bayesian text classifier. Given some text,
it calculates the posterior probabilities that the input resembles
one of any number of previously learned document collections.
It can be used to sort incoming email into arbitrary categories
such as spam, work, and play, or simply to distinguish an English text
from a French text. It fully supports international character sets,
and uses sophisticated statistical models based on the
Maximum Entropy Principle.
