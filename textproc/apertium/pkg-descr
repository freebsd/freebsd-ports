Apertium is an open-source machine translation platform, initially aimed
at related-language pairs but recently expanded to deal with more
divergent language pairs (such as English-Catalan). The platform
provides:

1. a language-independent machine translation engine
2. tools to manage the linguistic data necessary to build a machine
   translation system for a given language pair and
3. linguistic data for a growing number of language pairs
