This module provides functions that deals with formatting data with
Content-Type 'text/plain; format=flowed' as described in RFC2646
(http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2646.txt). In a nutshell,
format=flowed text solves the problem in plain text files where it
is not known which lines can be considered a logical paragraph,
enabling lines to be automatically flowed (wrapped and/or joined)
as appropriate when displaying.

In format=flowed, a soft newline is expressed as " \n", while hard
newlines are expressed as "\n". Soft newlines can be automatically
deleted or inserted as appropriate when the text is reformatted.
