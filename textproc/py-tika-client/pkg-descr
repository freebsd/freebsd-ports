Tika Rest Client, simplified: No need to worry about XML or JSON responses,
downloading a Tika jar file or Python 2. Support for Tika 2+ only.

Full support for type hinting

Nearly full test coverage run against an actual Tika server for multiple
Python and PyPy versions

Uses HTTP multipart/form-data to stream files to the server (instead of
reading into memory)

Optional compression for parsing from a file content already in a buffer (as
opposed to a file)
