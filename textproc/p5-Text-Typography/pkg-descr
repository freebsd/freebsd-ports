This module is a thin wrapper for John Gruber's SmartyPants plugin for
various CMSs.

SmartyPants is a web publishing utility that translates plain ASCII
punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML
entities. SmartyPants can perform the following transformations:

* Straight quotes ( " and ' ) into "curly" quote HTML entities
* Backticks-style quotes (``like this'') into "curly" quote HTML entities
* Dashes (-- and ---) into en- and em-dash entities
* Three consecutive dots (...) into an ellipsis entity
