This is the Text::FillIn.pm module.  It is a class for implementing
fill-in text templates.  It is designed to be flexible and
sub-classible.

You can specify the delimiters that mark sections of text to be filled
in (for example [[ and ]], or <!-- and -->, or { and } ... you get the
picture), and you can specify the actions to take when filling in those
sections.
