Text::WrapI18N intends to be a better Text::Wrap module. This module is needed
to support multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312,
and Big5. This module also supports characters with irregular widths, such as
combining characters (which occupy zero columns on terminal, like diacritical
marks in UTF-8) and fullwidth characters (which occupy two columns on terminal,
like most of east Asian characters). Also, minimal handling of languages which
doesn't use whitespaces between words (like Chinese and Japanese) is supported.

Like Text::Wrap, hyphenation and "kinsoku" processing are not supported, to keep
simplicity.
