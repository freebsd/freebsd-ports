uchardet is an encoding detection library, which takes a sequence
of bytes in an unknown character encoding without any additional
information, and attempts to determine the encoding of the text.
Returned encoding names are iconv-compatible.

It started as a C language binding of the original C++ implementation
of the universal charset detection library by Mozilla. It can now
detect more charsets, and more reliably than the original implementation.
