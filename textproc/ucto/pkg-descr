Ucto tokenizes text files: it separates words from punctuation, and splits
sentences. It offers several other basic preprocessing steps such as changing
case that you can all use to make your text suited for further processing such
as indexing, part-of-speech tagging, or machine translation.

Ucto comes with tokenisation rules for several languages and can be easily
extended to suit other languages. It has been incorporated for tokenizing Dutch
text in Frog, our Dutch morpho-syntactic processor.
