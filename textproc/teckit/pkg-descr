TECkit (Text Encoding Conversion toolkit) is a toolkit for converting data
between 8-bit legacy encodings and Unicode. It can also be used for
transliteration of Unicode between different scripts.

TECkit uses a mapping description language (mapping byte encodings to Unicode).
Mapping rules can be extended by (1) the use of character sequences rather than
single characters on either side; (2) by the addition of contextual constraints
(environments) determining when a rule should apply; (3) and by the use of
character classes, optional and repeatable elements, grouping and alternation
to express more complex patterns to be matched and processed.

TECkit is particularly useful with XeTeX (Unicode-aware derivate of TeX).

The following binaries are provided:

  teckit_compile  mapping compiler that allows binary mapping tables (.tec)
                  to be built from TECkit description files (.map)
  sfconv          a tool for converting Standard Format (SF) files
  txtconv         a utility to apply TECkit mappings to plain-text files
