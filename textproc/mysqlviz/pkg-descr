Render a graphical representation of a MySQL or SQLite database
from a mysqldump or sqlite3 .dump file.

Features:
- Can infer foreign key relationships if you do not have them defined
- Handles partial dumps (FK to tables that are not defined within the dump)
- Fast! Uses sed and grep for data extraction (MySQL only)
