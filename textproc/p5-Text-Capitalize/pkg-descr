Text::Capitalize provides a few different flavors of procedures for
title-like formatting for strings.

For the "capitalize" function Title-like (written by Stanislaw Y.
Pusep) formatting consists of ensuring that the first letter of
each word is uppercase, and that the rest is lowercase.

The "capitalize_title" function tries to get closer to English title
capitalization rules where only the "important" words are supposed
to be capitalized. There are also some customization features
provided to allow the user to choose variant rules.
