This module provides encoding to LaTeX escapes from utf8 using mapping 
tables in Pod::LaTeX and HTML::Entities. This covers only a subset of the 
Unicode character table (undef warnings will occur for non-mapped chars).

Mileage will vary when decoding (converting TeX to utf8), as TeX is in 
essence a programming language, and this module does not implement TeX.

I use this module to encode author names in BibTeX and to do a rough job 
at presenting LaTeX abstracts in HTML. Using decode rather than seeing 
$\sqrt{\Omega^2\zeta_n}$ you get something that looks like the formula.

The next logical step for this module is to integrate some level of TeX 
grammar to improve the decoding, in particular to handle fractions and 
font changes (which should probably be dropped).
