xmlgen is a TCL package to write XML documents in Tcl.

This XML code is expressed by TCL code, which is translated.

Every tag is made into a markup command which takes attributes and
the element's content as parameters and then prints the XML tagged
content. Of course, the content again can contain markup commands.
