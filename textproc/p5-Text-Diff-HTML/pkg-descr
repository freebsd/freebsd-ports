This class subclasses Text::Diff::Unified, a formatting class provided
by the Text::Diff module, to add XHTML markup to the unified diff
format. For details on the interface of the diff() function, see the
Text::Diff documentation.

In the XHTML formatted by this module, the contents of the diff returned
by diff() are wrapped in a <div> element, as is each hunk of the diff.
Within each hunk, all content is properly HTML encoded using
HTML::Entities, and the various sections of the diff are marked up with
the appropriate XHTML elements.
