libstree is a generic suffix tree implementation, written in C.
It can handle arbitrary data structures as elements of a string.
Unlike most demo implementations, it is not limited to simple ASCII
character strings. Suffix tree generation in libstree is highly
efficient and implemented using the algorithm by Ukkonen, which
means that libstree builds suffix trees in time linear to the length
of the strings (assuming that string element comparisons can be done
in O(1)).
