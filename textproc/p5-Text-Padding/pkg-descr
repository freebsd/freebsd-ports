Text::Padding provides a simple way to align a text on the left, right or
center. If left & right are easy to achieve (see sprintf()), i found no cpan
module that achieved a simple text centering. Well, of course, Perl6::Form
provides it, but it's incredibly slow during startup / destroy time. And
Text::Reform was segfaulting during destroy time.

Hence this module, which aims to provide only those 3 methods.
