   The ht://Dig system is a complete world wide web indexing and
searching system for a domain or intranet. This system is not meant
to replace the need for powerful internet-wide search systems like
Yahoo! or Google. Instead it is meant to cover the needs for a
single company, campus, or even a sub section of a web site.

   As opposed to some WAIS-based or web-server based search engines,
ht://Dig can span many web servers as long as they all understand
the HTTP 1.0 protocol.
