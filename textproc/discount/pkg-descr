This is an implementation of John Gruber's Markdown text to html language.
There's not much here that differentiates it from any of the existing Markdown
implementations except that it's written in C instead of one of the vast flock
of scripting languages that are fighting it out for the Perl crown.

Markdown provides a library that gives you formatting functions suitable for
marking down entire documents or lines of text, a command-line program that you
can use to mark down documents interactively or from a script,
and a tiny (1 program so far) suite of example programs that show how to fully
utilize the markdown library.

It also does, by default, various smartypants-style substitutions.
