The highlighting-kate is a syntax highlighting library with support for
nearly one hundred languages.  The syntax parsers are automatically
generated from Kate syntax descriptions [1], so any syntax supported by
Kate can be added.  An (optional) command-line program is provided,
along with a utility for generating new parsers from Kate XML syntax
descriptions.
