The TDH utilities are a set of programs and filters useful in working
with ordinary tabular ascii data from the command line or in shell
scripts. They were developed to supplement standard Unix utilities
such as sort and uniq. Two of the utilities are designed to work
specifically with tab-delimited exports from Excel/spreadsheets.
A full-featured date and time package (libchron) is also included.
