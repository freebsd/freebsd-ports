Redland is a set of libraries that provide a high-level interface for
RDF allowing the model to be stored, queried and manipulated. Redland
implements each of the RDF model concepts in its own class and
provides an object based API for them. Some of the classes providing
the parsers, storage mechanisms and other elements are built as
modules that can be added or removed as required.
