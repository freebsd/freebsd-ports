XML::RSS::Parser is a lightweight liberal parser of RSS feeds. This parser
is "liberal" in that it does not demand compliance of a specific RSS version
and will attempt to gracefully handle tags it does not expect or understand.
The parser's only requirements is that the file is well-formed XML and
remotely resembles RSS. Roughly speaking, well formed XML with a channel
element as a direct sibling or the root tag and item elements etc.

There are a number of advantages to using this module then just using
a standard parser-tree combination. There are a number of different RSS
formats in use today. In very subtle ways these formats are not entirely
compatible from one to another. XML::RSS::Parser makes a couple assumptions
to "normalize" the parse tree into a more consistent form. For instance,
it forces channel and item into a parent-child relationship.
