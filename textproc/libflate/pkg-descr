Flate is a template library used to deal with html code in CGI applications.
The library includes C and Perl support. All html code is put in an external
file (the template) and printed using the library functions: variables, zones
(parts to be displayed or not) and tables (parts to be displayed 0 to n times).
Using this method you don't need to modify/recompile your application when
modifying html code, printing order doesn't matter in your CGI code, and your
CGI code is much cleaner.
