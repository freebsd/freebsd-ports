Spreadsheet::GenerateXLSX provides a function generate_xlsx which takes an array
of Perl data and generates a simple Excel spreadsheet in the XLSX format. The
generated sheets have the first row frozen, and auto filters enabled for every
column.

Each sheet in the spreadsheet is generated from an array of rows, where each row
is an arrayref. The first row is treated as a header row.

The generated spreadsheet can have any numbers of sheets. If you just pass
arrayrefs, the sheets will be named Sheet1, Sheet2, etc.
