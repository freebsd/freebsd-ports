Greeking is the use of random letters or marks to show the overall appearance
of a printed page without showing the actual text. Greeking is used to make
it easy to judge the overall appearance of a document without being distracted
by the meaning of the text.

This is a module is for quickly generating varying meaningless text from any
source to create this illusion of the content in systems.

This module was created to quickly give developers simulated content to fill
systems with simulated content. Instead of static Lorem Ipsum text, by using
randomly generated text and optionally varying word sources, repetitive and
monotonous patterns that do not represent real system usage is avoided.
