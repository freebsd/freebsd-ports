xxdiff is a computer program that allows a user (usually a software
developer of some sort) to easily visualize the differences between
files. The manner and goal for which this process is applied over
multiple files is highly dependent on the application, and most of
the time is driven by custom user scripts.

For example, a configuration management engineer in a company might
provide some kind of merge policing environment, that allows software
developers to review changes in files for the purpose of accepting or
rejecting a submitted changeset to a codebase. Another example is
that of a developer wishing to review the changes he made to a
checkout of files from a source-code management system such as CVS,
Subversion, ClearCase, Perforce, etc.
