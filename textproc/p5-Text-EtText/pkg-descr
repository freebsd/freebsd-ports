EtText is a simple plain-text to HTML convertor.  It provides an
easy-to-edit, easy-to-read and intuitive way to write HTML.

EtText markup is simple and effective; it is very similar to
WikiWikiWeb TextFormattingRules or Zope's StructuredText.
It tries to be XHTML conformant in its generated code.
