sphinx-book-theme is an interactive book theme for Sphinx.

This is a lightweight Sphinx theme designed to mimic the look-and-feel of an
interactive book. It has the following primary features:
- Bootstrap 4 for visual elements and functionality.
- Flexible content layout that is inspired by beautiful online books, such as
  the Edward Tufte CSS guide
- Visual classes designed for Jupyter Notebooks. Cell inputs, outputs, and
  interactive functionality are all supported.
- Launch buttons for online interactivity. For pages that are built with
  computational material, connect your site to an online BinderHub for
  interactive content.
