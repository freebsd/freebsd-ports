[ excerpt from developer's www site ]

Yaxpo is a hand-written nonvalidating XML 1.0 + XMLNS processing
suite for Objective Caml, designed for flexibility in new and unusual
applications of XML. The Yaxpo parser provides all three pull, push
(SAX-like), and accumulate (DOM-like) interfaces. The latter of
these provides a data model complete with DOM-like constructors,
accessors, mutators, and serializers, enabling you to manipulate
and emit XML as well as parse it.
