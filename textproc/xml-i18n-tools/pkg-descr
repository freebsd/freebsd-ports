The module contains some utility scripts and assorted auto* magic for
internationalizing various kinds of XML files. This supersedes the
earlier scripts that I (Kenneth) distributed to be checked into each
module. In addition, it has an additional merging feature, currently
only for oaf files. This feature might be extented to handle .desktop
files and MIME files in the future.

* Features

o Automatically extracts translatable strings from oaf, glade, bonobo
   ui, nautilus theme and other XML files into the po files.

o Automatically merges translations from po files back into .oaf files
   (encoding to be 7-bit clean). I can also extend this merging
   mechanism to support other types of XML files.
