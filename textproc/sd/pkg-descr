sd is an intuitive find & replace tool.

Features:
- Painless regular expressions.  sd uses regex syntax that you
  already know from JavaScript and Python.  Forget about dealing
  with quirks of sed or awk - get productive immediately.
- String-literal mode.  Non-regex find & replace.  No more backslashes
  or remembering which characters are special and need to be escaped.
- Easy to read, easy to write.  Find & replace expressions are split
  up, which makes them easy to read and write.  No more messing with
  unclosed and escaped slashes.
- Smart, common-sense defaults.  Smart-cased regular expressions
  also come with a sane syntax that's not opt-in.  Defaults follow
  common sense and are tailored for typical daily use.
