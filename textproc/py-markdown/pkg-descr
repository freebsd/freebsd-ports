Markdown is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a
software tool that converts the plain text formatting to (X)HTML. The
formatting syntax is designed to be easy and intuitive for web authors
and resembles typical email formatting conventions. The resultant
(X)HTML is structurally valid.
