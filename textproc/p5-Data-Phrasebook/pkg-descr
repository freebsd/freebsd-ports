Data::Phrasebook is a collection of modules for accessing phrasebooks
from various data sources.

Common uses of phrasebooks are in handling error codes, accessing
databases via SQL queries and written language phrases. Examples are the
mime.types file and the hosts file, both of which use a simple
phrasebook design.
