towncrier is a utility to produce useful, summarized news files (also known as
changelogs) for your project.

Rather than reading the Git history, or having one single file which developers
all write to and produce merge conflicts, towncrier reads "news fragments" which
contain information useful to end users.

Used by Twisted, pytest, pip, BuildBot, and attrs, among others.

While the command line tool towncrier requires Python to run, as long as you
don't use any Python-specific affordances (like auto-detection of the project
version), it is usable with any project type on any platform.
