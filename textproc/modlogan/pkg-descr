Modlogan is for all those who want a log-analyzer that is easy
to extend and very flexible. Just write a new output plugin and
create your very special report-design. You don't have to
reinvent the whole wheel to change the colour of the tire.
Imagine a SQL-output-plugin that writes the calculated data
into your database. Or a Memo generator that posts the
monthly stats to your department mailing list for further
investigation.
