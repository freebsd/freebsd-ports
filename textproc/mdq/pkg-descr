mdq aims to do for Markdown what jq does for JSON: provide an easy way to zero
in on specific parts of a document.

For example, GitHub PRs are Markdown documents, and some organizations have
specific templates with checklists for all reviewers to complete. Enforcing
these often requires ugly regexes that are a pain to write and worse to debug.
