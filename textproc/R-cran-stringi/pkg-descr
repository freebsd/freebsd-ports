stringi (pronounced "stringy") is THE R package for fast, correct,
consistent and convenient string/text processing in each locale and
any native character encoding. The use of the ICU library gives R
users a platform-independent set of functions known to Java, Perl,
Python, PHP, and Ruby programmers.
