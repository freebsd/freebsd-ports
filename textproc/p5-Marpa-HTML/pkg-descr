Marpa::HTML does "high-level" parsing of HTML. It allows handlers to be
specified for elements, terminals and other components in the hierarchical
structure of an HTML document. Marpa::HTML is an extremely liberal HTML parser.
Marpa::HTML does not reject any documents, no mater how poorly they fit the HTML
standards.
