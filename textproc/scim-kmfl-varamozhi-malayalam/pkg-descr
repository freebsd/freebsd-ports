This is a keyboard for input of the Malayalam according to the transliteration
scheme called Mozhi (https://sites.google.com/site/cibu/mozhi). The keymap is
written in Keyman keyboard language and developed as a part of Varamozhi
Project under the LGPL license.

The Mozhi is intended to be the most intuitive scheme for Malayalam speakers.
It simplifies what the user needs to remember and is is not phonetically
accurate.

This keymap supports the current standard for Malayalam Chillus (i.e. without
special encoding). It offers mnemonic keyboard functionality and smart-quote
functionality with comas and numerals.

This port installs the keyboard so that it can be used through SCIM KMFL
IMEngine (textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine).
