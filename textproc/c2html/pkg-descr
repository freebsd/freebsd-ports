C2html is a syntax highlighter for C source code that produces a
highlighted html file as output.

C2html offers the following features:

    - fast (single pass conversion using flex)
    - doesn't change formatting - only adds <FONT COLOR=#XXXX> tags
        and properly escapes non-ascii characters
    - easy integration with webservers - browse your sources colourized!
    - gzips http output for browsers to save bandwidth (only in CGI mode)
    - documentation and manpage included

Please use the java2html port for converting C++ sources!
