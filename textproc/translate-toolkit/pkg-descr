The Translate Toolkit is a set of software and documentation designed
to help make the lives of localizers both more productive and less
frustrating.  The software includes programs to covert localization
formats to the common PO format and programs to check and manage PO
files.  The documentation includes guides on using the tools, running a
localization project and how to localize various projects from
OpenOffice.org to Mozilla.

At its core the software contains a set of classes for handling various
localization storage formats: DTD, properties, OpenOffice.org GSI/SDF,
CSV and of course PO and XLIFF.  It also provides scripts to convert
between these formats.

Also part of the Toolkit are Python programs to create word counts,
merge translations and perform various checks on PO and XLIFF files.
