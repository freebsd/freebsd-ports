libtranslate is a library for translating text and web pages between
natural languages. Its modular infrastructure allows to implement new
translation services separately from the core library.

libtranslate is shipped with a generic module supporting web-based
translation services such as Babel Fish, Google Language Tools and
SYSTRAN. Moreover, the generic module allows to add new services
simply by adding a few lines to a XML file (see the services.xml(5)
manual page).

The libtranslate distribution includes a powerful command line
interface (see the translate(1) manual page).
