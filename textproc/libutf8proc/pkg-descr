This is the Public software group utf8proc library repackaged as a
conveniance library for NetSurf.

This takes the unicode 5 capable version 1.1.6 of the library and
converts it to the NetSurf build system. additional API has been added
with a normalisation function but there are no data changes from
upstream.
