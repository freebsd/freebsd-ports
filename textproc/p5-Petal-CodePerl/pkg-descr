This module provides a CodeGenerator for Petal that inherits almost
everything from Petal::CodeGenerator but modifies how expressions are
dealt with. Petal normally includes code like this

  $hash->get( "not:user" )

in the compiled template. This means the path has to be parsed and
interpreted at runtime. Using Petal::CodePerl, Petal will now produce this

  ! ($hash->{"user"})

which will be much faster.

It uses Parse::RecDescent to parse the PETALES expressions which makes it
a bit slow to load the module but this won't matter much unless you have
turned off caching. It won't matter at all for something like Apache's
mod_perl.
