Orange3 Text extends Orange3, a data mining software package, with common
functionality for text mining. It provides access to publicly available data,
like NY Times, Twitter, Wikipedia and PubMed. Furthermore, it provides tools
for preprocessing, constructing vector spaces (like bag-of-words, topic
modeling, and similarity hashing) and visualizations like word cloud end geo
map. All features can be combined with powerful data mining techniques from
the Orange data mining framework.
