Pod::Spell is a Pod formatter whose output is good for spellchecking.
Pod::Spell rather like Pod::Text, except that it doesn't put much
effort into actual formatting, and it suppresses things that look
like Perl symbols or Perl jargon (so that your spellchecking program
won't complain about mystery words like "$thing" or "Foo::Bar" or
"hashref").
