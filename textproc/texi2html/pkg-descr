texi2html takes Texinfo files (and not info ones) and produces a set of HTML 
files. The quality of the output is close to the printed output and is much 
better than an info->HTML gateway. It understands most Texinfo version 2 
commands and runs without problem on big Texinfo files like the GNU Emacs 19 
manual.
