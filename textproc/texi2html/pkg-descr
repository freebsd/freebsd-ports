texi2html takes Texinfo files (and not info ones) and produces a set of HTML
files. The quality of the output is close to the printed output and is much
better than an info->HTML gateway. It understands most Texinfo version 2
commands and runs without problem on big Texinfo files like the GNU Emacs 19
manual.
