The Link Grammar Parser is a syntactic parser of English, based on link
grammar, an original theory of English syntax. Given a sentence, the system
assigns to it a syntactic structure, which consists of a set of labeled links
connecting pairs of words. The parser also produces a "constituent"
representation of a sentence (showing noun phrases, verb phrases, etc.).
