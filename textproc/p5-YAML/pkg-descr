The YAML.pm module implements a YAML Loader and Dumper based on the YAML
1.0 specification, http://www.yaml.org/spec/

YAML is a generic data serialization language that is optimized for
human readability. It can be used to express the data structures of most
modern programming languages, including Perl.

For information on the YAML syntax, please refer to the YAML
specification.
