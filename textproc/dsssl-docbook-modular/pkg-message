These are DSSSL stylesheets for the DocBook DTD by Norm Walsh. Use them
in conjunction with a DSSSL processor (such as jade) to convert documents
marked up as DocBook to other formats.

For example (assume $DBPATH = $PREFIX/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl/modular)

   jade -t sgml -d $DBPATH/html/docbook.dsl  filename.sgml  (DocBook -> HTML)
   jade -t rtf  -d $DBPATH/print/docbook.dsl filename.sgml  (DocBook -> RTF )
   jade -t tex  -d $DBPATH/print/docbook.dsl filename.sgml  (DocBook -> TeX )

To further parse the output of the 'tex' transformation you will need the
'jadetex' macros, which may not yet have been ported.

More documentation (in HTML format) is available in

   $PREFIX/share/sgml/docbook/dsssl/modular/doc/
