SVG::Parser is an XML parser for SVG Documents. It takes XML as input and
produces an SVG object as its output.

SVG::Parser supports both XML::SAX and XML::Parser (Expat) parsers, with SAX
preferred by default. Only one of these needs to be installed for SVG::Parser to
function.

A list of preferred parsers may be specified in the import list - SVG::Parser
will use the first parser that successfully loads. Some basic measures are taken
to provide cross-compatibility. Applications requiring more advanced parser
features should use the relevant parser module directly; see SVG::Parser::Expat
and SVG::Parser::SAX.
