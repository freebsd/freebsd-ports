Pager for grep, git-grep, ripgrep and similar grep
implementations, and allows for opening the indexed
file locations in a user-specified editor such as vim
or emacs.

vgrep is inspired by the ancient cgvg scripts but
extended to perform further operations such as listing
statistics of files and directory trees or showing the
context lines before and after the matches.
