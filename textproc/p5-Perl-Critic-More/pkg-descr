This is a collection of Perl::Critic policies that are not included in the
Perl::Critic core for a variety of reasons:

  Experimental

    Some policies need some time to work out their kinks, test usability, or
    gauge community interest. A subset of these will end up in the core
    Perl::Critic someday.

  Requires special dependencies

    For example, some policies require development versions of PPI (or some
    other CPAN module). These will likely end up in the Perl::Critic core when
    their dependencies are fulfilled.

  Peripheral to Perl

    For example, the Editor::RequireEmacsFileVariables policy is metacode.
    Also, the Miscellanea::RequireRcsKeywords policy pertains to the
    development process, not the code itself. These are not part of
    Perl::Critic's mission.

  Special purpose

    For example, policies like CodeLayout::RequireASCII designed to scratch
    itches not felt by most of the community. These will always remain in a
    Perl::Critic supplement instead of in the core.
