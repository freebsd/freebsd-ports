The Python package custom_inherit provides convenient, light-weight tools for
inheriting docstrings in customizeable ways.

Features:
 * Metaclass that instructs children to inherit docstrings for their
   attributes from their parents, using custom docstring inheritance styles.
 * Decorator that merges a string/docstring with the docstring of the decorated
   object using custom styles.
 * Built-in docstring merging styles for popular docstring specifications:
   * NumPy docstring specification
   * Napoleon docstring specifications (for both Google and NumPy styles)
   * Merging based on reST sections
   * Simple inheritance from a parent, if the docstring is not overwritten
 * Simple interface for using your own docstring inheritance style.
