deplate is a ruby based tool for converting documents written in wiki-like
markup to LaTeX, HTML, "HTML slides", or docbook. It supports page templates,
embedded LaTeX code, footnotes, citations, bibliographies, automatic generation
of an index, table of contents etc. It can be used to create web pages and (via
LaTeX or Docbook) high-quality printouts from the same source. In this respect
it is similar to tools like remoteaft or remotetxt2tags.
