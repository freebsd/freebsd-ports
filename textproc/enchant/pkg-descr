On the surface, Enchant appears to be a generic spell checking library. You
can request dictionaries from it, ask if a word is correctly spelled, get
corrections for a misspelled word, etc...

Beneath the surface, Enchant is a whole lot more - and less - than that.
You'll see that Enchant isn't really a spell checking library at all.

"What's that?" you ask. Well, Enchant doesn't try to do any of the work
itself. It's lazy, and requires backends to do most of its dirty work. Looking
closer, you'll see the Enchant is more-or-less a fancy wrapper around the
dlopen() system call. Enchant steps in to provide uniformity and conformity
on top of these libraries, and implement certain features that may be lacking
in any individual provider library. Everything should "just work" for any and
every definition of "just working."
