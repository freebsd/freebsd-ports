Jaxup defines an interface to update XML documents, through which clients can
work without knowledge of the exact object model that the document uses. The
interface is called Updater, and the idea behind it is the same as with Jaxen's
Navigator interface. In addition, an implementation of xmldb.org's proposed
XUpdate specification is provided. The implementation is in the XUpdate class.

Implementations of the Updater interface are provided for the following object
models:

  - DOM
  - Dom4j
  - JDom
