Aspell is a spelling checker designed to eventually replace
ispell, although it currently lacks many of ispell's basic
functions. Aspell's main feature is that it does a much better
job of coming up with possible suggestions than ispell. Aspell
also includes a powerful C++ library with C and Perl interfaces
in the works.
