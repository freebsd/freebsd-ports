language_data is a supplement to the langcodes module, for working with
standardized codes for human languages. It stores the more bulky and
hard-to-index data about languages, particularly what they are named in various
languages.

The functions and test cases for working with this data are in langcodes,
because working with the data correctly requires parsing language codes.
