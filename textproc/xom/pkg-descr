XOM is a new XML object model. It is an open source (LGPL), tree-based API for
processing XML with Java that strives for correctness and simplicity.

XOM is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use. It works very
straight-forwardly, and has a very shallow learning curve. Assuming you're
already familiar with XML, you should be able to get up and running with XOM
very quickly.
