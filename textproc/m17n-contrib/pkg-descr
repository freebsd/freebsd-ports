Esperanto, Gujarati, Hindi, Yi, Inuktitut, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam,
Marathi, Nepali, Ojibwe syllabics, Oriya, Punjabi, Pashto, Russian, Sindhi,

The port also provides the tbl2mim.awk script for conversion of keyboard
files used by textproc/scim-table-imengine into SCIM-independent .mim format
(usable by m17n library).
