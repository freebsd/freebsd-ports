You have two databases of person records that need to be synchronized
or matched up, but they use different keys--maybe one uses SSN and
the other uses employee id. The only fields you have to match on
are first and last name.

That's what this module is for. 

Just feed the first and last names to the name_eq() function, and
it returns undef for no possible match, and a percentage of certainty
(rank) otherwise.
