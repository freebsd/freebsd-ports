MkDocs Material provides numerous icons from Material, FontAwesome, and
Octicons, but it does so by inlining the SVG icons into the source.  Currently
there is no easy way access these icons and arbitrarily insert them into
Markdown content.  Users must include the icon fonts themselves and do it with
HTML.

This module allows you to use PyMdown Extensions' Emoji extension to enable
easy insertion of MkDocs Material's SVG assets using simple :emoji-syntax:.

This is done by creating our own emoji index and emoji generator.  The custom
index provides a modified version of the Emoji extensions Twemoji index.
