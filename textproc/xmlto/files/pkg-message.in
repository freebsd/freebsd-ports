For benefits of conversions away from XHTML1 through XSL-FO,
a stylesheet xhtml2fo.xsl has been installed
into %%DATADIR%%. Example use:

  xmlto pdf -x %%DATADIR%%/xhtml2fo.xsl myXHTML1file.xml

More style sheets for XHTML1 conversions can be found at
<http://www.antennahouse.com/XSLsample/XSLsample.htm>
under "Stylesheet for XHTML to XSL-FO transformation"
