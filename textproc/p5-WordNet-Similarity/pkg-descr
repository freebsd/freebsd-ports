This package consists of Perl modules along with supporting Perl programs
that implement the semantic relatedness measures described by Leacock
Chodorow (1998), Jiang Conrath (1997), Resnik (1995), Lin (1998), Hirst St
Onge (1998), Wu Palmer (1994), the adapted gloss overlap measure by
Banerjee and Pedersen (2002), and a measure based on context vectors
by Patwardhan (2003). The details of the Vector measure are described in the
Master's thesis work done by Patwardhan (2003) at the University of Minnesota
Duluth. The  Perl modules are designed as objects with methods that take as
input two word senses. The semantic relatedness of these word senses is
returned by these methods. A quantitative measure of the degree to which two
word senses are related has wide ranging applications in numerous areas, such
as word sense disambiguation, information retrieval, etc. For example, in
order to determine which sense of a given word is being used in a particular
context, the sense having the highest relatedness with its context word
senses is most likely to be the sense being used. Similarly, in information
retrieval, retrieving documents containing highly related concepts are more
likely to have higher precision and recall values.

A command line interface to these modules is also present in the package. The
simple, user-friendly interface returns the relatedness measure of two given
words.
