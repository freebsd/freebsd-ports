This is a small and simple package that takes the output of XML::Parser as
a tree, and gives simple methods for accessing the structure of an XML
document. It is very lightweight, but provides the simplest access to an XML
document possible. It does not subclass XML::Parser; rather, it is meant to
serve purely as an object struct for an outgoing tree.
