Petal::Mail processes a Petal XML template, and then turns the resulting
XML into a text email which can be sent through sendmail or other. The XML
has to follow a certain syntax which is defined in this documentation.

Since Petal::Mail's is a subclass of Petal, its API is the same. Which
means you need to read about Petal before you can use Petal::Mail.
