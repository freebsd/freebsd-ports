This port provides an implementation of ULID.

A ULID is a universally unique lexicographically sortable identifier. It is
- 128-bit compatible with UUID
- 1.21e+24 unique ULIDs per millisecond
- Lexicographically sortable!
- Canonically encoded as a 26 character string, as opposed to the 36 character
  UUID
- Uses Crockford's base32 for better efficiency and readability (5 bits per
  character)
- Case insensitive
- No special characters (URL safe)
