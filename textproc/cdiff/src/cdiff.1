.Sh NAME
.Nm cdiff
.Nd show diffs with colors
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cdiff
.Op Fl m
.Op Ar diff ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads a unidiff or context diff from stdin or a set of (optionally compressed)
files and URLs, adds color codes, expands tabs to 8 spaces, and passes the
results to
.Xr less 1 .
If used on a color terminal, it makes diffs much easier to read.
There is also handling of "cvs annotate" in it.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m
Use bold, reverse and underline codes (for monochrome terminals).
.El
.Sh AUTHORS
.Nm
was written by
.An Eivind Eklund Aq eivind@FreeBSD.org .
based on a sed line somebody passed around.  The code is (much) smaller than
this man page.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr diff 1 ,
.Xr less 1 ,
.Xr cvs 1 .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
assumes standard ANSI color escape sequences (as used by xterm and most other
commonly used terminals), rather than using
.Xr curses 3 .
.Pp
.Nm
should really be a large and complex C program based on
.Xr less 1
and a diff library.  This would allow a more informative display, including
collapsing pure deletions/insertions inside a single line to one line with
colors for deleted/added material, avoiding the line-wrap problems in less
due to less not knowing the effects or lengths of the color escape codes,
and correct handling of shifted tabs (instead of just expanding them to
spaces.)
