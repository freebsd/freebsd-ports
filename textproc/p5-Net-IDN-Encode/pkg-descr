This module provides an easy-to-use interface for encoding and decoding
Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs).

IDNs use characters drawn from a large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA
allows the non-ASCII characters to be represented using only the ASCII
characters already allowed in so-called host names today (letter-digit-
hypen, "/[A-Z0-9-]/i").
