This module takes a list of CSS files and concatenates them, making sure
to honor any valid @import statements included in the files.

Following the CSS 2.1 spec, @import statements must be the first rules in
a CSS file. Media-specific @import statements will be honored by enclosing
the included file in an @media rule. This has the side effect of actually
improving compatibility in Internet Explorer, which ignores media-specific
@import rules but understands @media rules.

It is possible that feature versions will include methods to compact
whitespace and other parts of the CSS itself, but this functionality is
not supported at the current time.
