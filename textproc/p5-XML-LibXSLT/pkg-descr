This module is a fast XSLT library, based on the Gnome libxslt engine
that you can find at http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/

Performance is currently about twice that of XML::Sablotron (based on
XSLTMark tests converted to Perl).

The libxslt processor is also highly standards compliant, with
practically all of XSLT 1.0 being supported in version 0.9 of libxslt.

This is free software, you may use it and distribute it under the same
terms as Perl itself. Copyright 2001 AxKit.com Ltd, All rights reserved.
