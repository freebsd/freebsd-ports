SAC (Simple API for CSS) is an event-based API much like SAX for XML.
If you are familiar with the latter, you should have little trouble
getting used to SAC.  More information on SAC can be found online at
http://www.w3.org/TR/SAC.

CSS having more constructs than XML, core SAC is still more complex than
core SAX.  However, if you need to parse a CSS style sheet, SAC probably
remains the easiest way to get it done.
