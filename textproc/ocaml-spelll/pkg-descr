Spelll is a fuzzy string library for OCaml allowing the following:

1. to compute the edition distance bewteen two strings,

2. to build a Levenshtein automaton that only accepts strings within an
   edition distance to the string used to create the automaton,

3. to map a string to its matches from an Index.t (a "multimap").
