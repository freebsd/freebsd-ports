This is a keyboard for typesetting Ancient Greek with precomposed Unicode
characters. It is written in Keyman Keyboard Language by SIL Non-Roman Script
Initiative (NRSI).

The main purpose of the keyboards is to provide a wide range of keying options,
so many characters can be entered in multiple ways. The features include:

  * preserving the context when deleting;
  * choosing the correct code for the sigma depending upon the encoding and
    the context (so the correct final form is used when appropriate);
  * understanding the context of gamma so that it can be typed as 'n' before
    kappa, xi or chi and as 'ng' before another gamma.
  * support for Greek punctuation.
