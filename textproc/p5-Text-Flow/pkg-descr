This module provides a flexible way to wrap and flow text for both ASCII and
non-ASCII outputs.

The main purpose of this module is to provide text wrapping and flowing
features without being tied down to ASCII based output and fixed-width
fonts. My needs were for a more sophisticated text control in PDF and GIF
output formats in particular.
