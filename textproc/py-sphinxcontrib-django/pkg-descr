sphinxcontrib-django is a sphinx extension which improves the documentation of
Django apps.

Improvements for the output of Sphinx's autodoc for Django classes:
- List all model and form fields as class parameters
- Improve model field representations
- Link related and reverse related fields to the referenced class
- Hide irrelevant runtime information like declared_fieldsets, fieldsets and
  Meta from classes
- Add information about autogenerated methods
- Fix intersphinx mappings to Django modules
- Custom text roles to cross-reference the documentations of Django (:setting:,
  :templatetag:, :templatefilter:, :fieldlookup:) and Sphinx (:event:,
  :confval:)
