Petal is a XML based templating engine that is able to process any kind of
XML, XHTML and HTML.

Petal borrows a lot of good ideas from the Zope Page Templates TAL
specification, it is very well suited for the creation of WYSIWYG XHTML
editable templates.

The idea is to further enforce the separation of logic from presentation.
With Petal, graphic designers can use their favorite WYSIWYG editor to
easily edit templates without having to worry about the loops and ifs
which happen behind the scene.
