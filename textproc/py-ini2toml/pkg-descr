The original purpose of this project is to help migrating setup.cfg files to PEP
621, but by extension it can also be used to convert any compatible .ini/.cfg
file to TOML.

Please notice, the provided .ini/.cfg files should follow the same syntax
supported by Python's ConfigParser library (here referred to as INI syntax) and
more specifically abide by ConfigUpdater restrictions (e.g., no interpolation or
repeated fields).
