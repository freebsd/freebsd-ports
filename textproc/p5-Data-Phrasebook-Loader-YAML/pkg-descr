This class loader implements phrasebook patterns using YAML.

Phrases can be contained within one or more dictionaries, with each phrase
accessible via a unique key. Phrases may contain placeholders, please see
Data::Phrasebook for an explanation of how to use these. Groups of phrases are
kept in a dictionary. In this implementation a single file is one complete
dictionary.
