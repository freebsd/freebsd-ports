POD is a pretty simple format to write, but it can be a big pain to deal with
reading it and doing anything useful with it. Most existing POD parsers care
about semantics, like whether a =item occurred after an =over but before a back,
figuring out how to link a L<>, and other things like that.

Pod::Eventual is much less ambitious and much more stupid. Fortunately, stupid
is often better. (That's what I keep telling myself, anyway.)

Pod::Eventual reads line-based input and produces events describing each POD
paragraph or directive it finds. Once complete events are immediately passed to
the handle_event method. This method should be implemented by Pod::Eventual
subclasses. If it isn't, Pod::Eventual's own handle_event will be called, and
will raise an exception.
