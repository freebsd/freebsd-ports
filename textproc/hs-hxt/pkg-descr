The Haskell XML Toolbox bases on the ideas of HaXml and HXML, but
introduces a more general approach for processing XML with Haskell.  The
Haskell XML Toolbox uses a generic data model for representing XML
documents, including the DTD subset and the document subset, in Haskell.
It contains a validating XML parser, a HTML parser, namespace support,
an XPath expression evaluator, an XSLT library, a RelaxNG schema
validator and funtions for serialization and deserialization of user
defined data.  The library makes extensive use of the arrow approach for
processing XML.
