Reno is a release notes manager designed with high throughput in mind,
supporting fast distributed development teams without introducing additional
development processes. The goal is to encourage detailed and accurate release
notes for every release.

Reno uses git to store its data, along side the code being described. This means
release notes can be written when the code changes are fresh, so no details are
forgotten. It also means that release notes can go through the same review
process used for managing code and other documentation changes.

Reno stores each release note in a separate file to enable a large number of
developers to work on multiple patches simultaneously, all targeting the same
branch, without worrying about merge conflicts. This cuts down on the need to
rebase or otherwise manually resolve conflicts, and keeps a development team
moving quickly.

Reno also supports multiple branches, allowing release notes to be back-ported
from master to maintenance branches together with the code for bug fixes.
