Snowball is a small string processing language for creating stemming algorithms
for use in Information Retrieval, plus a collection of stemming algorithms
implemented using it.

Stemming maps different forms of the same word to a common "stem" - for example,
the English stemmer maps connection, connections, connective, connected, and
connecting to connect. So a searching for connected would also find documents
which only have the other forms.
