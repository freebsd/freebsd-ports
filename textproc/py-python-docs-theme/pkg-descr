This is the theme for the Python documentation.

Note that when adopting this theme, you're also borrowing an element of the
trust and credibility established by the CPython core developers over the years.

That's fine, and you're welcome to do so for other Python community projects if
you so choose, but please keep in mind that in doing so you're also choosing to
accept some of the responsibility for maintaining that collective trust.
