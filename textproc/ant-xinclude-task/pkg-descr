XInclude task for Jakarta Ant. The Ant XInclude task allows Ant
build files to apply XInclude processing to XML files. It is
based on the XInclude processor developed by Elliotte Rusty
Harold. You need the xincluder.jar file for the XInclude task to
work properly. Please put this JAR in your CLASSPATH along with
the xinclude-task JAR file.
