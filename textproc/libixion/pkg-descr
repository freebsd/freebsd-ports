Ixion is a library for calculating the results of formula expressions stored in
multiple fomrula cells.  The cells can be referenced by each other, and Ixion
resolves their dependencies automatically upon calculation. Ixion also supports
re-calculations where the contents of one or more cells have been modified since
the last calculation, and a partial calculation of only the affected cells need
to be calculated.
