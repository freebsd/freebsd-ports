A universal Python parser combinator library inspired by Parsec library of
Haskell.
A parser combinator is a function (higher-order function) that accepts several
parsers as arguments and return a new parser as result. Parser combinators
enable a recursive descent parsing strategy, this parsing technique facilitates
modular piecewise construction and testing.
