Universal Feed Parser is a Python module for downloading and parsing
syndicated feeds. It can handle RSS 0.90, Netscape RSS 0.91, Userland
RSS 0.91, RSS 0.92, RSS 0.93, RSS 0.94, RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, Atom, and
CDF feeds.

To use Universal Feed Parser, you will need Python 2.1 or later.
Universal Feed Parser is not meant to run standalone; it is a module
for you to use as part of a larger Python program.

Universal Feed Parser is easy to use; the module is self-contained in
a single file, feedparser.py, and it has only one public function,
parse.  parse takes a number of arguments, but only one is required,
and it can be a URL, a local filename, or a raw string containing feed
data in any format.
