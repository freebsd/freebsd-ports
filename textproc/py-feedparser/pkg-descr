Universal Feed Parser is a Python module for downloading and parsing syndicated
feeds. It can handle RSS 0.90, Netscape RSS 0.91, Userland RSS 0.91, RSS 0.92,
RSS 0.93, RSS 0.94, RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, Atom 0.3, Atom 1.0, and CDF feeds.

Universal Feed Parser is easy to use; the module is self-contained in a single
file, feedparser.py, and it has one primary public function, parse.  parse
takes a number of arguments, but only one is required, and it can be a URL, a
local filename, or a raw string containing feed data in any format.
