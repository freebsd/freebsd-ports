A high-speed character set detection library.

libguess employs discrete-finite automata to deduce the character set
of the input buffer. The advantage of this is that all character sets
can be checked in parallel, and quickly. Right now, libguess passes a
byte to each DFA on the same pass, meaning that the winning character
set can be deduced as efficiently as possible.

libguess is fully reentrant, using only local stack memory for DFA operations.
