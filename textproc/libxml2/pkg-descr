Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project (but
usable outside of the Gnome platform).  XML itself is a metalanguage to design
markup languages, i.e. text language where semantic and structure are added to
the content using extra "markup" information enclosed between angle brackets.
