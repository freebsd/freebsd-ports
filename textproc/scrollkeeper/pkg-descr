ScrollKeeper is a cataloging system for documentation on open systems.
It manages documentation metadata (as specified by the Open Source
Metadata Framework (OMF) and provides a simple API to allow help browsers
to find, sort, and search the document catalog.  It will also be able to
communicate with catalog servers on the Net to search for documents which
are not on the local system.
