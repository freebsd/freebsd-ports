Lexilla is a free library of language lexers that can be used with the Scintilla
editing component. Originally, this functionality was incorporated inside
Scintilla. It has been extracted as a separate project to make it easier for
contributors to work on support for new languages and to fix bugs in existing
lexers. It also defines a protocol where projects can implement their own
lexers and distribute them as they wish.
