This package reads and writes any document that conforms to the PDF
specification generously provided by Adobe at
http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/pdf/index_reference.html

The file format is well-supported, with the exception of the
"linearized" or "optimized" output format, which this module can read
but not write.  Many specific aspects of the document model are not
manipulable with this package (like fonts), but if the input document
is correctly written, then this module will preserve the model
integrity.

This library grants you some power over the PDF security model. Note
that applications editing PDF documents via this library MUST respect
the security preferences of the document. Any violation of this
respect is contrary to Adobe's intellectual property position, as
stated in the reference manual at the above URL.
