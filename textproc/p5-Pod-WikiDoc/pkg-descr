Pod works well, but writing it can be time-consuming and tedious. For example,
commonly used layouts like lists require numerous lines of text to make just a
couple of simple points. An alternative approach is to write documentation in
a wiki-text shorthand (referred to here as wikidoc) and use Pod::WikiDoc to
extract it and convert it into its corresponding Pod as a separate .pod file.
