Sphinx is a full-text search engine, distributed under GPL version

Generally, it's a standalone search engine, meant to provide fast,
size-efficient and relevant fulltext search functions to other
applications. Sphinx was specially designed to integrate well with SQL
databases and scripting languages. Currently built-in data sources
support fetching data either via direct connection to MySQL, or from
an XML pipe.

As for the name, Sphinx is an acronym which is officially decoded as
