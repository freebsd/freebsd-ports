The FoilTeX is a collection of LaTeX files for making foils.  A number
of features are built-in including large sans serif font as normal font,
options for setting normalsize at 20pt (default), 17pt, 25pt or 30pt,
new macros for starting new foils, for special environments like Theorem
and Proof, simple macros to control the headline and footline.
