By default, this module exports a single hash (`%RE') that stores or
generates commonly needed regular expressions. Patterns currently
provided include:

   * balanced parentheses and brackets
   * delimited text (with escapes)
   * integers and floating-point numbers in any base (up to 36)
   * comments in C, C++, Perl, and shell
   * offensive language
   * lists of any pattern
   * IPv4 addresses
