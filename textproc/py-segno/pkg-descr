Segno is a pure Python QR Code generator with no dependencies.

This package implements ISO/IEC 18004:2015(E) "QR Code bar code symbology
specification" and produces QR Codes and Micro QR Codes with nearly no effort.
It supports the Structured Append mode which splits a message across several QR
codes.

Segno (Italian for "sign" / "symbol") provides several serialization formats
like Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Portable
Network Graphics (PNG), Portable Document Format (PDF), Netpbm (PAM, PBM, PPM),
LaTeX (PGF/TikZ), X PixMap (XBM), and X Bitmap (XPM) etc. None of these
serializers require an external lib. Further, it provides several high level
functions to create QR Codes which encode contact data (vCard, MeCard), EPC QR
Codes, or WIFI QR Codes.
