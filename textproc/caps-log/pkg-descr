Cap's Log is a small, terminal UI journaling tool, storing daily entries as
markdown, with a simple structure of tags and sections, and a calendar
view to show annual events and track habits or activities.

It supports local encryption, and can also use git to work across multiple
computers.

Refer to the README for more general usage.
