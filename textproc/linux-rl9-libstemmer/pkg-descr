Snowball stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval Snowball
provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a "stemmed"
form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common morphological
endings removed; hopefully representing a common linguistic base form.
This is most useful in building search engines and information
retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming enabled should
be able to find a document containing "cycling" given the query
"cycles".
