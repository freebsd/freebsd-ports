This module is for generating documents in Rich Text Format.

This module is a class; an object belonging to this class
acts like an output filehandle, and calling methods on it
causes RTF text to be written.

Incidentally, this module also exports a few useful functions, 
upon request.

The following documentation assumes some familiarity with
the RTF Specification.  Users not already intimately
familiar with RTF should look at RTF::Cookbook.
