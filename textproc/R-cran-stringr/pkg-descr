stringr is a set of simple wrappers that make R's string functions
more consistent, simpler and easier to use. It does this by ensuring
that: function and argument names (and positions) are consistent,
all functions deal with NA's and zero length character appropriately,
and the output data structures from each function matches the input
data structures of other functions.
