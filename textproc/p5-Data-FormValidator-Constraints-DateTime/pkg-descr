This package provides constraint routines for Data::FormValidator for
dealing with dates and times.  It provides an easy mechanism for
validating dates of any format (using strptime(3)) and transforming
those dates (as long as you 'untaint' the fields) into valid DateTime
objects, or into strings that would be properly formatted for various
database engines.
