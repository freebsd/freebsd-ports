This is a collection of functions for dealing with PPI objects, many of
which originated in Perl::Critic.  They are organized into modules by
the kind of PPI class they relate to, by replacing the "PPI" at the
front of the module name with "PPIx::Utilities", e.g. functionality
related to PPI::Nodes is in PPIx::Utilities::Node.
