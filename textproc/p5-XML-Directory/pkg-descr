This extension provides two classes: XML::Directory::String and
XML::Directory::SAX. Their methods make it possible to set parameters
such as level of details or maximal number of nested sub-directories
and generate either string containing the resulting XML or SAX events.

The SAX generator supports both SAX1 and SAX2 handlers. There are two
SAX interfaces available: basic ContentHandler and optional ErrorHandler.
