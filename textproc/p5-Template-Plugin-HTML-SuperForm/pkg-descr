This is an interface into HTML::SuperForm through the Template Toolkit. When 
created without arguments (i.e. [% USE form = HTML.SuperForm %]), the 
Template's stash is searched for an Apache object or a CGI object to pass to 
HTML::SuperForm's constructor.

When created with arguments (i.e. [% USE form = HTML.SuperForm(arg) %]), 
the arguments are passed to HTML::SuperForm's constructor.
