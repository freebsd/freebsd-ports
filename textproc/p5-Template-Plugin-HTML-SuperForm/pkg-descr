This is an interface into HTML::SuperForm through the Template Toolkit. When
created without arguments (i.e. [% USE form = HTML.SuperForm %]), the
Template's stash is searched for an Apache object or a CGI object to pass to
HTML::SuperForm's constructor.

When created with arguments (i.e. [% USE form = HTML.SuperForm(arg) %]),
the arguments are passed to HTML::SuperForm's constructor.
