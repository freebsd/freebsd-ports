A number of simple C programs for manipulating HTML & XML: number headings,
make a table of contents, make an index, manage bibliographic references
(a simple implementation of refer(1) for HTML), list all links,
create cross-references, extract elements that match a (CSS) selector, etc.
Most are meant to be used in a Unix pipe or in shell scripts.
