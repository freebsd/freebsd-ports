RXP is a very fast validating XML parser written by Richard Tobin
of the University of Edinburgh. It complies fully with the W3C test
suites (although we have compiled it without Unicode support for
the time being). pyRXP is a wrapper around this which constructs a
lightweight in-memory "tuple tree" in a single call. This structure
is the lightest one we could define in Python, and it is constructed
entirely in C code, resulting in unprecedented speed. It is a core
part of ReportLab's forthcoming XML toolkit, which aims to offer
simple, fast and pythonic tools for common XML processing tasks.
