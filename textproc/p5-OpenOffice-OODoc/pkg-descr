OpenOffice::OODoc is an extensible Perl interface allowing direct
read/write operations on files which comply with the
OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF),
i.e. the ISO/IEC 26300:2006 standard.

It provides a high-level, document-oriented language, and isolates
the programmer from the details of the file format. It can process
different document classes (texts, spreadsheets, presentations,
and drawings). It can retrieve or update styles and images,
document metadata, as well as text content.
