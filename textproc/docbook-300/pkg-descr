The DocBook DTD defines structural and content-based SGML markup
for computer documentation, with a primary emphasis on software
documentation and related classes of technical documents. Its
main high-level hierarchical structures are for books, reference
entries (for example, ``man pages''), and articles. It is
maintained by the Davenport Group (about which see the Davenport
archive at http://www.ora.com/davenport/ or
ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/davenport/).

This port contains DocBook 3.0
