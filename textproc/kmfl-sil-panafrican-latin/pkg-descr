This is a set of two keyboards that provides a single implementation for many
Roman writing systems across Africa, based on results compiled from data from
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo.

The keyboards are written in Keyman keyboard language and developed by SIL
Non-Roman Script Initiative (NRSI). The software is distributed under the
X11-style license (http://scripts.sil.org/X11License).

This port installs the keyboard so that it can be used through SCIM or
IBus KMFL IMEngine (textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine, textproc/ibus-kmfl).
Two layouts are provided:

  * mnemonic layout for any keyboard (using deadkeys);
  * positional layout for US keyboard (using deadkeys and/or shift-states, i.e.
    RALT and LALT keys).
