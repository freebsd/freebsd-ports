We provide a library and an executable for working with derived Show instances.
By using the library, we can parse derived Show instances into a generic data
structure. The ppsh tool uses the library to produce human-readable versions
of Show instances, which can be quite handy for debugging Haskell programs.
We can also render complex generic values into an interactive Html page, for
easier examination.
