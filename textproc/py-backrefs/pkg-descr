Backrefs is a wrapper around Python's built-in Re and the 3rd party Regex
library.

Backrefs adds various additional back references (and a couple other features)
that are known to some regular expression engines, but not to Python's Re
and/or Regex.  The supported back references actually vary depending on the
regular expression engine being used as the engine may already have support for
some.
