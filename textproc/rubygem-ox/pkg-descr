Ox, standing for Optimized XML, is a XML parser and object serializer,
which is designed to be a speed-optimized alternative to Nokogiri and Marshal.

* Ox is self contained, and uses nothing other than standard C libraries.
* Ox writes/parses generic XML documents including HTML documents.
* Ox serializes Objects into human readable XML in contrast to Marshal
* Ox also supports SAX parsing.
