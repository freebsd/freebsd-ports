Render R Markdown to Markdown (without using 'knitr'), and Markdown to
lightweight HTML or 'LaTeX' documents with the 'commonmark' package (instead of
'Pandoc'). Some missing Markdown features in 'commonmark' are also supported,
such as raw HTML or 'LaTeX' blocks, 'LaTeX' math, superscripts, subscripts,
footnotes, element attributes, and appendices, but not all 'Pandoc' Markdown
features are (or will be) supported. With additional JavaScript and CSS, you can
also create HTML slides and articles. This package can be viewed as a
trimmed-down version of R Markdown and 'knitr'. It does not aim at rich Markdown
features or a large variety of output formats (the primary formats are HTML and
'LaTeX'). Book and website projects of multiple input documents are also
supported.
