Text::Template::Simple is a simple template module. There is no extra
template/mini language. Instead, it uses Perl as the template language.
Templates can be cached on disk or inside the memory via the internal cache
manager. It is also possible to use static/dynamic includes, pass parameters to
includes and apply filters on them. Also see Text::Template::Simple::API for the
full API reference.
