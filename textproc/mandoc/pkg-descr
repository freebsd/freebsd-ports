mandoc is a suite of tools compiling mdoc, the roff macro language of
choice for BSD manual pages, and man, the predominant historical language
for UNIX manuals. It is small, ISO C, ISC-licensed, and quite fast. The
main component of the toolset is the mandoc utility program, based on the
libmandoc validating compiler, to format output for UTF-8 and ASCII UNIX
terminals, HTML 5, PostScript, and PDF.

mandoc was formerly distributed as mdocml.
