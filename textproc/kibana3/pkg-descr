Kibana is an open source (Apache Licensed), browser based analytics and search
interface to Logstash and other timestamped data sets stored in ElasticSearch.
With those in place Kibana is a snap to setup and start using (seriously).
Kibana strives to be easy to get started with, while also being flexible and
powerful.
