Rarian is designed to be a replacement for scrollkeeper.  It is
currently undergoing heavy development.  As of writing, rarian can be
installed in place of scrollkeeper and everything will work okay.

Rarian manages documentation metadata (as specified by the Open Source
Metadata Framework (OMF) and provides a simple API to allow help browsers
to find, sort, and search the document catalog.  It will also be able to
communicate with catalog servers on the Net to search for documents which
are not on the local system.
