The FreeBSD Documentation Project maintains the FAQ, Handbook and tutorials.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-port" that depends on other text processing packages.  Its sole
purpose is to require dependencies so users can install this package only
and have all the Documentation Project stuff pulled in by the port/package
dependency mechanism.
