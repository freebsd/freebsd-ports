Text::NSP - The Ngram Statistic Package allows a user to count 
sequences of Ngrams in large corpora of text, and measure their 
association.

The module NSP.pm is a stub that doesn't have any real functionality. 
The real work is done by five programs:

count.pl statistic.pl rank.pl combig.pl kocos.pl

These are not modules, and are run from the command line.
