pytomlpp is a python wrapper for toml++.

Some points you may want to know before use:

* Using toml++ means that this module is fully compatible with TOML
  v1.0.0.
* We convert toml structure to native python data structures
  (dict/list etc.) when parsing, this is more inline with what json
  module does.
* The binding is using pybind11.
* The project is tested using toml-test and pytest.
* We support all major platforms
  (Linux, Mac OSX and Windows), for both CPython and Pypy and all
  recent Python versions. You just need to pip install and we have a
  pre-compiled binaries ready. No need to play with clang, cmake or
  any C++ toolchains.
