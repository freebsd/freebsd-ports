XML::Mini is a set of Perl classes that allow you to access XML data and
create valid XML output with a tree-based hierarchy of elements.

XML::Mini does not require any external libraries or modules and is pure Perl.
If available, XML::Mini will use the Text::Balanced module in order to escape
limitations of the regex-only approach (eg "cross-nested" tag parsing).
