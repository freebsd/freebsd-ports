# Using (5.5.2) commit hash in 5.5.x branch not the 5.5.2 tag
# because that branch has the module and package name set as
# 'elastisearch' not 'elasticsearch5'. The reason this is
# needed (for now) is because:
#
# 1) Upstream doesn't package tests with the sdist, so
#    we need USE_GITHUB until they do.
# 2) This port fetches distfile from the *elastisearch*
#    PyPI package *NOT* the 'elasticsearch5' PyPI package,
#    which has the different internal package name.
#
# Upstream made separate (versioned) packages on PyPI
# available so that they didn't conflict on install.
# The elasticsearchX python ports should be changed to
# use these version-specific package names/sources, at
# which point CONFLICTS can be removed.

# All tests pass with or without elasticsearch server running, but without
# it running, connection errors are displayed. upstream test runs display these
# errors too. More tests run when elasticsearch server is running.
