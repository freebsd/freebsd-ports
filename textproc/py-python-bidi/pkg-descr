The python-bidi library provides bi-directional (BiDi) layout algorithms
for Python. It offers a wrapper for the unicode-bidi Rust crate.

This library is used to correctly display text that mixes left-to-right
and right-to-left scripts. It also includes a command-line utility called
`pybidi` for running the display algorithm.
