Pod::Elemental is a system for treating a Pod (plain old documentation)
documents as trees of elements. This model may be familiar from many other
document systems, especially the HTML DOM. Pod::Elemental's document
object model is much less sophisticated than the HTML DOM, but still makes
a lot of document transformations easy.
