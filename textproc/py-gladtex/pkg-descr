GladTeX is a preprocessor that enables the use of LaTeX maths within HTML
files. The maths, embedded in <EQ>...</EQ> tags, as if within \(..\) in
LaTeX (or $...$ in TeX), is fed through latex and replaced by images.

Additionally all images get an alt-tag for alternative texts that contains
the LaTeX-equivalent of the image. This is handy for text-mode browsers or
blind people.

* GladTeX supports caching of formulas in order to enable incremental
  document editing or simply to share formulas across web pages.

* GladTeX can be used with Pandoc in order to convert MarkDown to HTML with
  LaTeX formulas.

* It also contains a library GleeTeX to custom tailor the generation and
  conversion process to your needs and to embedd it into your (web)
  application.

* It allows the usage of umlauts and other non-ASCII characters within
  formulas, by replacing these characters through LaTeX sequences.

* It is cross-platform, written in Python.

* Its source code is documented and tested.
