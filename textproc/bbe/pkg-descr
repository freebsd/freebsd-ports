Instead of reading input in lines as sed, bbe reads
arbitrary blocks from an input stream and performs
byte-related transformations on found blocks. Blocks
can be defined using start/stop strings, stream offset
and block length, or a combination. Basic editing commands
include delete, replace, search/replace, binary operations
(and, or, etc.), append, and bcd/ASCII conversion. For
examining the input stream, it contains some grep-like
features like printing the input file name, stream offset,
and block number of found blocks. Block contents can also
be printed in different formats like hex, octal, ASCII, and
binary.
