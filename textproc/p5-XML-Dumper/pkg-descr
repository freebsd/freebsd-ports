XML::Dumper dumps Perl data to a structured XML format.  XML::Dumper can
also read XML data that was previously dumped by the module and convert
it back to Perl.

This might be useful for dumping Perl objects to files using an XML
format that can be reloaded or accessed by other programs. Maybe even
other languages.
