Dblatex started as a DB2LaTeX clone. So, why this project? The purpose
is a bit different on these points:

(1) The project is end-user oriented, that is, it tries to hide as much
as possible the latex compiling stuff by providing a single clean
script to produce directly DVI, PostScript and PDF output.

(2) The actual output rendering is done not only by the XSL stylesheets
transformation, but also by a dedicated LaTeX package. The purpose is
to allow a deep LaTeX customisation without changing the XSL
stylesheets.

(3) Post-processing is done by Python, to make publication faster,
convert the images if needed, and do the whole compilation.
