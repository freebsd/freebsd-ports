Spellutils is a suite of programs which are used to isolate some parts
or texts from various types of files and hand them over to another
program which may change the texts; it is typically a spell checker.
Afterwards the possibly changed text parts are copied back in place in
the original file.

1) The newsbody utility
The program newsbody is a utility to isolate the body part of a news or
email message in a separate file and then call some other program which
may change the body, and eventually merge the headers with the possibly
changed body. Optionally quotes and/or signature can be removed too, as
well as all or selected header lines can be kept.

2) The pospell utility
The program pospell is a utility to isolate the translations from a .po
file, then call some other program which may change the translations
(typically a spell checker), and eventually copy them back in place in
the .po file.
