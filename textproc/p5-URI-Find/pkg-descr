This module does one thing:  finds URIs and URLs in plain text.  It
finds them quickly and it finds them all (or what URI::URL considers
a URI to be).  It employs a series of heuristics too:
  - Find schemeless URIs (ie. www.foo.com)
  - Avoid picking up trailing characters from the text
  - Avoid picking up URL-like things such as Perl module names.
