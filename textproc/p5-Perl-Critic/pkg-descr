Perl::Critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying coding
standards to Perl source code. Essentially, it is a static source code
analysis engine. Perl::Critic is distributed with a number of
Perl::Critic::Policy modules that attempt to enforce various coding
guidelines. Most Policies are based on Damian Conway's book
Perl Best Practices.
You can choose and customize those Polices through the
Perl::Critic interface. You can also create new Policy modules that
suit your own tastes.

For a convenient command-line interface to Perl::Critic, see the
documentation for perlcritic. If you want to integrate Perl::Critic with
your build process, Test::Perl::Critic provides a nice interface that is
suitable for test scripts.
