Rubber is a program whose purpose is to handle all tasks related to the
compilation of LaTeX documents. This includes compiling the document itself,
of course, enough times so that all references are defined, and running
BibTeX to manage bibliographic references. Automatic execution of dvips to
produce PostScript documents is also included, as well as usage of pdfLaTeX
to produce PDF documents.
