Prosper is a LaTeX class for writing transparencies.

It is written on top of the seminar class by Timothy Van Zandt.

It aims at offering an environment for easily creating slides for both
presentations with an overhead projector and a video projector.

Slides prepared for a presentation with a computer and a video projector
may integrate animation effects, incremental display, and such.
