krep is an optimized string search utility designed for maximum throughput and
efficiency when processing large files and directories. It is built with
performance in mind, offering multiple search algorithms and SIMD acceleration
when available.

Note: Krep is not intended to be a full replacement or direct competitor to
feature-rich tools like grep or ripgrep. Instead, it aims to be a minimal,
efficient, and pragmatic tool focused on speed and simplicity.

Krep provides the essential features needed for fast searching, without the
extensive options and complexity of more comprehensive search utilities. Its
design philosophy is to deliver the fastest possible search for the most common
use cases, with a clean and minimal interface.
