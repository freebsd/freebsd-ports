This module provides simple word wrapping.  It breaks long lines, but
does not alter spacing or remove existing line breaks.  If you're
looking for more sophisticated text formatting, try the Text::Format
module. 

In short, Text::Wrapper is the object-oriented equivalent of Text::Wrap,
but with fewer bugs (I hope).
