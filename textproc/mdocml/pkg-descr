mdocml is a suite of tools compiling mdoc, the roff macro package of
choice for BSD manual pages, and man, the predominant historical
package for UNIX manuals. The mission of mdocml is to deprecate groff,
the GNU troff implementation, for displaying mdoc pages whilst
providing token support for man.

mdocml consists of the libmandoc validating compiler and mandoc, which
interfaces with the compiler library to format output for UNIX
terminals (with support for wide-character locales), XHTML, HTML,
PostScript, and PDF.

Disambiguation: mdocml is often referred to by its installed binary,
"mandoc".
