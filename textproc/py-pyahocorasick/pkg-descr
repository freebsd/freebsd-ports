pyahocorasick is a fast and memory efficient library for exact or approximate
multi-pattern string search meaning that you can find multiple key strings
occurrences at once in some input text. The library provides an ahocorasick
Python module that you can use as a plain dict-like Trie or convert a Trie to an
automaton for efficient Aho-Corasick search.
