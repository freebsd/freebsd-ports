AI::Categorizer is a framework for automatic text categorization. It
consists of a collection of Perl modules that implement common
categorization tasks, and a set of defined relationships among those
modules. The various details are flexible - for example, you can choose
what categorization algorithm to use, what features (words or otherwise)
of the documents should be used (or how to automatically choose these
features), what format the documents are in, and so on.

The basic process of using this module will typically involve obtaining a
collection of pre-categorized documents, creating a "knowledge set"
representation of those documents, training a categorizer on that
knowledge set, and saving the trained categorizer for later use. There are
several ways to carry out this process. The top-level AI::Categorizer
module provides an umbrella class for high-level operations, or you may
use the interfaces of the individual classes in the framework.

A simple sample script that reads a training corpus, trains a categorizer,
and tests the categorizer on a test corpus, is distributed as eg/demo.pl .
