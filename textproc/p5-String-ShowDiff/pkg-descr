This module is a wrapper around the diff algorithm from the module
Algorithm::Diff. It's job is to simplify a visualization of the differences of
each strings.

Compared to the many other Diff modules, the output is neither in diff-style
nor are the recognised differences on line or word boundaries, they are at
character level.
