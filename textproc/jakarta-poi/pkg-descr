The POI project consists of APIs for manipulating various file formats based
upon Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document format using pure Java. In short, you
can read and write MS Excel files using Java. Soon, you'll be able to read and
write Word files using Java. POI is your Java Excel solution as well as your
Word Excel solution. However, we have a complete API for porting other OLE 2
Compound Document formats and welcome others to participate.
