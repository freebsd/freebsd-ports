Emacs major mode to create HTML files from Emacs buffers (in colour!)

This major mode will output the contents of an Emacs buffer as a
HTML file, preserving the colour attributes of that buffer.

This is a pretty elegant solution to produce nice listings of your
code in Erlang, C++, SML, Ruby (or whatever esoteric language you can
dig out a major mode for) to display on web sites.

As an example watch the ELISP code of this major mode

Because the colouring depends only on your major mode and perhaps
some individual settings (e.g. I prefer a dark background) you can
turn any Emacs buffer into HTML.
