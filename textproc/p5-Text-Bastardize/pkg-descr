Bastardize provides an magical object into which text can be charged
and then returned in various, slighty modified ways.

Among others, bastardize has the following methods:

rdct converts english to hyperreductionist english
    (ex. "english" becomes "")

pig pig latin
    (ex. "hi there" becomes "ihay erethay")

k3wlt0k a k3wlt0kizer developed originally by Fmh

rot13 implements rot13 "encryption" in perl
    (ex. "foo bar" becomes "sbb one")

rev reverses the arrangement of characters

censor attempts to censor text which might be innaproriate

n20e performs numerical abbreviations
    (ex. "numerical_abbreviation" becomes "n20e")
