JLess is a command-line JSON viewer designed for reading, exploring, and
searching through JSON data.

JLess will pretty print your JSON and apply syntax highlighting. Use it when
exploring external APIs, or debugging request payloads.

Expand and collapse Objects and Arrays to grasp the high- and low-level
structure of a JSON document. JLess has a large suite of vim-inspired commands
that make exploring data a breeze.

JLess supports full text regular-expression based search. Quickly find the data
you're looking for in long String values, or jump between values for the same
Object key.
