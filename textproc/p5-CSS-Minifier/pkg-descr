CSS::Minifier removes unnecessary whitespace from CSS. The primary requirement
developing this module is to not break working stylesheets: if working CSS is in
input then working CSS is output. The Mac/Internet Explorer comment hack will be
minimized but not stripped and so will continue to function.

This module understands space, horizontal tab, new line, carriage return, and
form feed characters to be whitespace. Any other characters that may be
considered whitespace are not minimized. These other characters include
paragraph separator and vertical tab.

For static CSS files, it is recommended that you minify during the build stage
of web deployment. If you minify on-the-fly then it might be a good idea to
cache the minified file. Minifying static files on-the-fly repeatedly is
wasteful.
