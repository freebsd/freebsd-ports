XML::Parser::EasyTree adds a new "built-in" style called "EasyTree" to 
XML::Parser.  Like XML::Parser's "Tree" style, setting this style causes 
the parser to build a lightweight tree structure representing the XML 
document.  This structure is, at least in this author's opinion, easier to 
work with than the one created by the built-in style.
