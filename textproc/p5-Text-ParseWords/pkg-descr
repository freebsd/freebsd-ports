This is a CORE module. If you installed perl 5.003 or above, a
version of this module is already available to you. This CPAN
package is only here to update core distributions prior 5.005.

The version provided is the same that comes with perl 5.00502.
If you run a newer version of perl, the version of Text::ParseWords
included there may be newer. This package is not fully synchronized
with the perl distributions.

Please run "perldoc Text::ParseWords" to see what this module
is for.
