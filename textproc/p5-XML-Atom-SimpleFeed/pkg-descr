This module exists to generate basic Atom syndication feeds.  While it
does not provide a full, object-oriented interface into all the nooks
and crannies of Atom feeds, an Atom parser, or an Atom client API, it
should be useful for people who want to generate basic, valid Atom feeds
of their content quickly and easily.
