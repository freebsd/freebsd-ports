Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of C++.
Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give your application the ability to read and write
XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing, generating, manipulating,
and validating XML documents using the DOM, SAX, and SAX2 APIs.

Xerces-C++ is faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation and many associated
standards.

The parser provides high performance, modularity, and scalability. Source code,
samples and API documentation are provided with the parser. For portability,
care has been taken to make minimal use of templates, no RTTI, and minimal use
of #ifdefs.
