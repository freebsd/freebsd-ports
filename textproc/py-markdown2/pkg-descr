py-markdown2  provides a converter written in Python that closely
matches the behaviour of the original Perl-implemented Markdown.pl.
There is another Python markdown.py , but markdown2.py is faster
and, to my knowledge, more correct.

Markdown is a light text markup format and a processor to convert
that to HTML.
