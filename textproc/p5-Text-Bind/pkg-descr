Text::Bind allows you to bind Perl structures (strings, routines,
filehandles, objects, and arrays) to specific locations (called *data
sites*) in text files.

The main purpose of this module is to support HTML templates for CGI
programs. Therefore, HTML pages design can be kept separate from CGI
code. However, the class is general enough to be used in other contexts
than CGI application development.
