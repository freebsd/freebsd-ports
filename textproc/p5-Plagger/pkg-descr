Plagger is a pluggable RSS/Atom feed aggregator written in
Perl. Everything is implemented as a small plugin and you can mash
them up together using Plagger core API and plugin hooks. You can
think of Plagger as a blosxom or qpsmtpd for RSS aggregator.

WARNING: This port depends on thousands of other ports spececially
with full options.
