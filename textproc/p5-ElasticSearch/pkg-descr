ElasticSearch is an Open Source (Apache 2 license), distributed, RESTful
Search Engine based on Lucene, and built for the cloud, with a JSON API.

Check out its features: <http://www.elasticsearch.org/>

This module is a thin API which makes it easy to communicate with an
ElasticSearch cluster.

It maintains a list of all servers/nodes in the ElasticSearch cluster,
and spreads the load across these nodes in round-robin fashion. If the
current active node disappears, then it attempts to connect to another
node in the list.

Forking a process triggers a server list refresh, and a new connection
to a randomly chosen node in the list.
