Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2Like exports Template-Toolkit variable
methods into Text::Xslate namespace, such that you can use them on
your variables.

The only difference between this module and Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2
is that Bridge::TT2 uses Template::Toolkit underneath, while this
module is independent of Template::Toolkit and therefore does not
require TT to be installed.
