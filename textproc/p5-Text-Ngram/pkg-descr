Text-Ngram

n-Gram analysis is a field in textual analysis which uses sliding
window character sequences in order to aid topic analysis, language
determination and so on. The n-gram spectrum of a document can be
used to compare and filter documents in multiple languages, prepare
word prediction networks, and perform spelling correction.

This module provides an efficient XS-based implementation of n-gram
spectrum analysis.
