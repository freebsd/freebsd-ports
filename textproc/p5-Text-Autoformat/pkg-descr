Text::Autoformat provides intelligent formatting of plaintext without
the need for any kind of embedded mark-up. The module recognizes
Internet quoting conventions, a wide range of bulleting and number
schemes, centred text, and block quotations, and reformats each
appropriately. Other options allow the user to adjust inter-word and
inter-paragraph spacing, justify text, and impose various capitalization
schemes. 

The module also supplies a re-entrant, highly configurable replacement
for the built-in Perl format() mechanism.
