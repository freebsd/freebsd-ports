Fldiff is a graphical diff program that shows the differences between two
files/directories, or a file/directory and a CVS or Subversion repository.

It is inspired by xdiff (Motif-based) and xxdiff (Qt-based), whose choice of
GUI toolkit has hampered their portability to many of the systems I work with.
