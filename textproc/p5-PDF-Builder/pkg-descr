There seem to be a growing plethora of Perl modules for creating and
manipulating PDF files.

PDF::Builder is a fork of PDF::API2, which is developed with the goal
of a more aggressive schedule of new features and bug fixes, while
aiming to keep all internal methods as upwardly compatible with PDF::API2
as possible.
