Television is a fast, fuzzy finder TUI inspired by the Neovim Telescope plugin.
It allows you to quickly search through various data sources like files, git
repositories, and environment variables using fuzzy matching. It's designed
to be extensible with custom channels and offers features
like syntax highlighting, shell integration, and theming.
