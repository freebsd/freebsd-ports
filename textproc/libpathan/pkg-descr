The Pathan project grew out of DecisionSoft's work on XMLScript , an 
XML transformation language.

XPath was adopted as a node selection language by XMLScript when the XPath 
specification was ratified by the W3C. DecisionSoft's XMLScript processor 
is based on Xerces-C, a Document Object Model compliant XML parser. Pathan 
therefore was designed from the base up to be fully compatible with the 
Xerces parser.

Pathan 1 represents the open sourcing of the XPath component of 
DecisionSoft's XMLScript processor. Pathan 1 features a full implementation 
of the XPath 1.0 Specification. Pathan 1 implements the W3C DOM Level 3 
XPath Specification (Working Draft February 08 2002) providing a powerful 
and coherent interface between XPath and DOM and hence a standardised 
interface with Xerces. 

Pathan is provided to the community as we feel that the Pathan module 
increases the scope and usefulness of the Xerces-C library and will be 
an aid to other XML developers in their projects.
