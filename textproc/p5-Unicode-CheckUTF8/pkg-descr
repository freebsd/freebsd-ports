This is an XS wrapper around some Unicode Consortium code to check if
a string is valid UTF-8, revised to conform to what expat/Mozilla
think is valid UTF-8, especially with regard to low-ASCII characters.

Note that this module has NOTHING to do with Perl's internal UTF8 flag
on scalars.

This module is for use when you're getting input from users and want
to make sure it's valid UTF-8 before continuing.
