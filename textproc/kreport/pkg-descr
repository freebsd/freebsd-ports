The KReport framework implements reporting functionality for creation of
reports in MS Access style. They are also similar to SAP Crystal Reports
and FileMaker reports.

Reports can be created interactively and programmatically. They can be
previewed on screen, printed, and saved in a variety of formats such
as HTML, PDF and OpenDocument.
