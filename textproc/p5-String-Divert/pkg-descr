String::Divert is small Perl 5 module providing a scalar-like string
object with some overloaded operators, supporting the concept of Folding
and Diversion.  This allows nested generation of structured output. The
idea is to decouple the sequential generation of output from the nested
and non-sequential structure of the output.
