You may like to put the file hevea.sty in a place where LaTeX
can find it.  For example, if you are using TeX Live from the
ports, the following commands will do the job:

mkdir -pv ~/texmf/tex/latex/hevea
ln -sfv /usr/local/lib/hevea/hevea.sty ~/texmf/tex/latex/hevea/hevea.sty
texhash ~/texmf
EOM
}
