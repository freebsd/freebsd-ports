HeVeA is a LaTeX to HTML translator. The input language is a fairly complete
subset of LaTeX 2e (old LaTeX style is also accepted) and the output language is
HTML that is (hopefully) correct with respect to version 5 [HTML-5a, HTML-5b].

HeVeA understands LaTeX macro definitions. Simple user style files are
understood with little or no modifications. Furthermore, HeVeA customization is
done by writing LaTeX code.

HeVeA is written in Objective Caml, as many lexers. It is quite fast and
flexible. Using HeVeA it is possible to translate large documents such as
manuals, books, etc. very quickly. All documents are translated as one single
HTML file. Then, the output file can be cut into smaller files, using the
companion program HaChA.

HeVeA can also be instructed to output plain text or info files.
