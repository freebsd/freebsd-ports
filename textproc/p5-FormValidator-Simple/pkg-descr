This module provides you a sweet way of form data validation with
simple constraints chains.

You can write constraints on single line for each input data.

This idea is based on Sledge::Plugin::Validator, and most of
validation code is borrowed from this plugin.

(Sledge is a MVC web application framework: http://sl.edge.jp [Japanese] )

The result object this module returns behaves like
Data::FormValidator::Results.
