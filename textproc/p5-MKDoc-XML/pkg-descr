MKDoc is a web content management system written in Perl which focuses on
standards compliance, accessiblity and usability issues, and multi-lingual
websites.

At MKDoc Ltd we have decided to gradually break up our existing commercial
software into a collection of completely independent, well-documented,
well-tested open-source CPAN modules.

Ultimately we want MKDoc code to be a coherent collection of module
distributions, yet each distribution should be usable and useful in
itself.

MKDoc::XML is part of this effort.

You could help us and turn some of MKDoc's code into a CPAN module. You
can take a look at the existing code at http://download.mkdoc.org/.

If you are interested in some functionality which you would like to see as
a standalone CPAN module, send an email to
<mkdoc-modules@lists.webarch.co.uk>
