TagSoup is a library for parsing HTML/XML. It supports the HTML 5
specification, and can be used to parse either well-formed XML, or
unstructured and malformed HTML from the web. The library also provides
useful functions to extract information from an HTML document, making it
ideal for screen-scraping.
