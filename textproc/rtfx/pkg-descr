rtfx converts RTF files into a generic XML format. It majors on keeping
meta data like style names, etc... rather than every bit of formatting.
This makes it handy for converting RTF documents into a custom XML
format (using XSL or an additional processing step).

RTF features supported: page breaks, section breaks, style names,
lists (various types), tables, footnotes, info block, bold, italic,
underline, super/sub script, hidden text, strike out, text color, fonts.
