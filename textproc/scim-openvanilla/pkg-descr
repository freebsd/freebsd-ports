OpenVanilla (OV) is an input method (IM)/output filter (OF) framework
designed for better end-user text processing experiences. For example,
OpenVanilla provides a comprehensive set of Traditional Chinese input
methods that are lacking or of which counterparts are functionally
deficient/unsatisfactory in Apple's Mac OS X. Many Simplified Chinese
users also find this framework useful. A Tibetan IM module is also
available.

scim-openvanilla is an OpenVanilla loader as a SCIM IM engine that
enables the input method modules of OpenVanilla to be used through
SCIM.
