This is a simple module which makes an unscientific effort at
summarizing English text. It recognizes simple patterns which look
like statements, abridges them, and concatenates them into something
vaguely resembling a summary. It needs more work on large bodies
of text, but it seems to have a decent effect on small inputs at
the moment.
