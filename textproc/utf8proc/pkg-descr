utf8proc is a library for processing UTF-8 encoded Unicode strings.
Some features are Unicode normalization, stripping of default ignorable
characters, case folding and detection of grapheme cluster boundaries.
A special character mapping is available, which converts for example the
characters "Hyphen" (U+2010), "Minus" (U+2212) and
"Hyphen-Minus" (U+002D, ASCII Minus) all into the ASCII minus sign, to
make them equal for comparisons.
