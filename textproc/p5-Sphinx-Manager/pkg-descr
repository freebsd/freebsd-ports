Sphinx::Manager provides utilities to start, stop, restart, and reload the
Sphinx search engine binary (searchd), and to run the Sphinx indexer program.
The utilities are designed to handle abnormal conditions, such as PID files not
being present when expected, and so should be robust in most situations.
