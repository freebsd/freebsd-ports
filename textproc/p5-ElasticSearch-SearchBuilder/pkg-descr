The Query DSL for ElasticSearch (see Query DSL
<http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/query-dsl>), which is used
to write queries and filters, is simple but verbose, which can make it
difficult to write and understand large queries.

ElasticSearch::SearchBuilder is an SQL::Abstract-like query language
which exposes the full power of the query DSL, but in a more compact,
Perlish way.

This module is considered stable. If you have suggestions for
improvements to the API or the documenation, please contact me.
