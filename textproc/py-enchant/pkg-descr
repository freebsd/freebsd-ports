PyEnchant is a set of language bindings and some wrapper classes to make
the excellent Enchant spellchecker available as a Python module.
The bindings are generated using SWIG. It includes all the functionality
of Enchant with the flexibility of Python and a nice 'Pythonic'
object-oriented interface. It also aims to provide some higher-level
functionality than is available in the C API.
