The Dictionary Server Protocol (DICT) is a TCP transaction based query/response
protocol that allows a client to access dictionary definitions from a set of
natural language dictionary databases.

RFC 2229 describes the DICT client/server protocol.

dictfmt converts databases in various formats into working databases and indices
for the DICT server.
