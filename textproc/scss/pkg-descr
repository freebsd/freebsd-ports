SCSS is a Scheme module for parsing, querying, and emitting style information
compatible with the W3C Cascading Stylesheets recommendation. While SCSS does
not itself provide any rendering functionality, it can provide style
information to applications and libraries that do. If used with XML documents
produced by SXML or SDOM, SCSS can accommodate the full range of selector types
described in the W3C recommendation; it can also match simple selectors against
strings when structured document information is not available.
