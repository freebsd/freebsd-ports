XML::Handler::Trees provides three PerlSAX handler classes for building
tree structures.  XML::Handler::Tree builds the same type of tree as the
"Tree" style in XML::Parser.  XML::Handler::EasyTree builds the same
type of tree as the "EasyTree" style added to XML::Parser by
XML::Parser::EasyTree.  XML::Handler::TreeBuilder builds the same type
of tree as Sean M. Burke's XML::TreeBuilder.  These classes make it
possible to construct these tree structures from sources other than
XML::Parser.
