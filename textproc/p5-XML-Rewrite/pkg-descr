Often, XML messages and schemas are created by automatic tools.  These
tools may provide very nice user interfaces, but tend to produce
horrible XML.  If you have to read these ugly products, you are in for
pain.  The purpose of this module (and the script "xmlrewrite" which is
part of this distribution) is to be able to rewrite XML messages and
Schema's into something maintainable.

The main difference between this module and other beautifiers is that
the clean-up is based on schema rules.  For instance, it is permitted
to remove blanks around and inside integers, but not in strings.
Beautifiers which do not look into the schema have only limited
possibilities for cleanup, or may accidentally change the message
content.
