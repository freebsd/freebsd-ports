    RTF::Tokenizer is an object-orientated low-level RTF reader. If
you're looking to render RTF, or want a higher-level RTF processor,
this is not the module for you - you want RTF::Reader.  This is the
sixth release of  RTF::Tokenizer - it's faster, higher quality, and
implements the RTF standard better than any previous release.

    It's also philosophically  a better  module,  and conforms more
strictly to Object Orientated  guidelines  - it can  be sub-classed
and the interface is cleaner.
