Do you have smaller Python projects that only need a README file for
documentation? Want to host your README on Read The Docs?

sphinx-me is a BSD licensed tool that will create a Sphinx documentation shell
for your project and include the README file as the documentation index. It
handles extracting the required meta data such as the project name, author and
version from your project for use in your Sphinx docs.

Once you use sphinx-me to build your Sphinx docs, you can then add your project
to the Read The Docs site and have your project's README hosted with an
attractive Sphinx documentation theme.

Your README file should be in a reStructuredText compatible format.
