XML/Ada is a full XML suite for use with Ada compilers, such as GNAT AUX.

XML/Ada is a set of modules that provide a simple manipulation of XML
streams.  It supports the whole XML 1.1 specification and can parse any file
that follows this standard, including the contents of the DTD although no
validation of the documents is performed based on those.

It provides support for a number of standards associated with XML such as
SAX, DOM, and XML schemas.  Additionally, it includes a module to manipulate
unicode streams since this is required by the XML standard.
