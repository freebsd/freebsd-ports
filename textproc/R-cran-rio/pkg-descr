Streamlined data import and export by making assumptions that the user is
probably willing to make: 'import()' and 'export()' determine the data
structure from the file extension, reasonable defaults are used for data import
and export (e.g., 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE'), web-based import is natively
supported (including from SSL/HTTPS), compressed files can be read directly
without explicit decompression, and fast import packages are used where
appropriate. An additional convenience function, 'convert()', provides a simple
method for converting between file types.
