info2man converts GNU info files to pod or -man formats.

GNU info can be a pain as it demands its own special pager, it's a binary
format, it's cruder than HTML and less documented, and most GNU- authored
manual entries basically say "we like info so we don't maintain this manual
entry, thus it is probably wrong". info2man thus converts info files so that
they can be read by ordinary tools.
