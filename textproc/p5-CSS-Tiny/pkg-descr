CSS::Tiny is a perl class to read and write .css stylesheets with as
little code as possible, reducing load time and memory overhead.

This module is primarily for reading and writing simple files, and
anything we write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments. If you
need something with more power, move up to CSS.pm.
