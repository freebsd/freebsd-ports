KMFL aims to bring Tavultesoft Keyman functionality to *nix operating
systems. KMFL is being jointly developed by SIL International
(http://www.sil.org) and Tavultesoft (http://www.tavultesoft.com).

This is compiler for keyboard sources written in Keyman keyboard
language (.kmn files). Resulting binaries (.kmfl) can be used with
SCIM KMFL IMEngine (textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine).

The powerful KMN keyboard language supports contextual deadkeys,
pre- and post-processing of keystrokes, rules grouping, 'storing'
of character classes for use in similar rules, custom and Unicode
character constants, SIL Ethnologue language codes, etc.

Official Tavultesoft repository contains keyboards that cover more
than 220 languages. Significant number of them are open source.
Ported keyboards are textproc/scim-kmfl-*.
