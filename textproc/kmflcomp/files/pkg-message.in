  Please note that kmflcomp only compiles keyboard sources written in
  Keyman keyboard language (.kmn) into .kmfl binaries. KMFL is source
  compatible with keyboards developed for Keyman. Binary keyboards
  compiled for Keyman will not run under KMFL. KMFL is also Unicode
  based, and does not support legacy code pages and encodings.

  The Keyman keyboard language is documented in

    %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/kmfl/kmflcomp/KMFL-Compiler.sxw

  Tavultesoft documentation is available on

    http://tavultesoft.com/keymandev/documentation/help/main/guide.php

  You need textproc/scim-kmfl-imengine to use KMFL keyboards through
  SCIM, or textproc/ibus-kmfl to use them through IBus. The keyboard
  ports are textproc/kmfl-*.
