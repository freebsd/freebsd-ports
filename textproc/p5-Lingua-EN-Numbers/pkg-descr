Lingua::EN::Numbers converts arbitrary numbers into human-oriented
English text. Limited support is included for parsing standardly
formatted numbers (i.e. '3,213.23'). But no attempt has been made
to handle any complex formats. Support for multiple variants of
English are supported. Currently only "American" formatting is
supported.
