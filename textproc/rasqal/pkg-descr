Rasqal is a free software / Open Source C library that handles Resource
Description Framework (RDF) query language syntaxes, query construction
and execution of queries returning results as bindings, boolean, RDF
graphs/triples or syntaxes. The supported query languages are SPARQL
Query 1.0, SPARQL Query 1.1, SPARQL Update 1.1 (no executing) and the
Experimental SPARQL extensions (LAQRS). Rasqal can write binding query
results in the SPARQL XML, SPARQL JSON, CSV, TSV, HTML, ASCII tables,
RDF/XML and Turtle / N3 and read them in SPARQL XML, CSV, TSV, RDF/XML
and Turtle / N3.
