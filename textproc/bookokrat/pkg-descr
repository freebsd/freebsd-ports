Bookokrat is a terminal-based EPUB and PDF reader with a split-view library and
reader, full MathML and image rendering, automatic bookmarks, inline
annotations, and customizable themes.

What you can do:

  - Browse every EPUB & PDF in the current directory or automatically detect
    and read from your Calibre library with proper metadata.
  - Drill into the table of contents, and resume exactly where you left off.
  - Search inside the current chapter or across the whole book, jump through a
    per-book history, and inspect reading statistics.
  - Highlight text, attach comments, export annotations to Markdown, copy
    snippets or entire chapters, and toggle the raw HTML source for debugging.
  - Read PDFs with a dedicated renderer (TOC navigation, page/scroll modes,
    bookmarks, and annotations) in graphics-capable terminals.
  - Open images in-place, follow internal anchors, launch external links in
    your browser, and hand off the EPUB to your system viewer.
  - Customize with multiple color themes, adjustable margins, and zen mode;
    settings persist across sessions.
  - Enter a Vim-style normal mode in the reader for precise motions, visual
    selection, and yanking to clipboard.
  - Load EPUB bundles (exploded .epub directories, including Apple Books
    exports) without repackaging.
  - Read complex HTML tables and rich cell content with improved rendering and
    image support.
