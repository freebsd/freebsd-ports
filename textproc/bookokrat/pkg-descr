Bookokrat is a terminal-based EPUB reader with a split-view library and reader,
full MathML and image rendering, automatic bookmarks, inline annotations, and
customizable themes.

What you can do:

  - Browse every EPUB in the current directory, drill into the table of
    contents, and resume exactly where you left off.
  - Search inside the current chapter or across the whole book, jump through a
    per-book history, and inspect reading statistics.
  - Highlight text, attach comments, copy snippets or entire chapters, and
    toggle the raw HTML source for debugging.
  - Open images in-place, follow internal anchors, launch external links in
    your browser, and hand off the book to your system viewer.
  - Customize with multiple color themes, adjustable margins, and zen mode;
    settings persist across sessions.
