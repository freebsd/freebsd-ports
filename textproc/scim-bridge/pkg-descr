Scim-bridge is wrapper library for SCIM, written in C. Scim-bridge
is separated in two parts, the agent and the clients. The agent is
the IME server which communicates with SCIM. The clients are IMModules
which communicate only with the agent so that there is no binary
dependency between the clients and SCIM.
