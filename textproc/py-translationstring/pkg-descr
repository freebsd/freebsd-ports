translationstring is a library used for internationalization (i18n) duties.

This package provides a translation string class, a translation string
factory class, translation and pluralization primitives, and a utility
that helps Chameleon templates use translation facilities of this package.
It does not depend on Babel, but its translation and pluralization
services are meant to work best when provided with an instance of
the babel.support.Translations class.
