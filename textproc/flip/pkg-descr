This program converts line endings of text files between MS-DOS and **IX
formats. It detects binary files in a nearly foolproof way and leaves them
alone unless you override this. It will also leave files alone that are already
in the right format and preserves file timestamps. User interrupts are handled
gracefully and no garbage or corrupted files left behind. 'flip' does not
convert files to a different character set, and it can not handle Apple
Macintosh line endings (CR only). For that (and more), you can use the 'recode'
program (package 'recode').
