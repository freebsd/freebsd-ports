Text::CSV::Hashify is designed for the case where you simply want to turn a CSV
file into a Perl hash. In particular, it is designed for the case where (a) the
CSV file's first record is a list of fields in the ancestral database table and
(b) one field (column) of which functions as a primary key, i.e., each record's
entry in that field is distinct from every other record's entry therein.

Text::CSV::Hashify turns that kind of CSV file into one big hash of hashes.
Elements of this hash are keyed on the entries in the designated primary key
field and the value for each element is a hash reference of all the data in a
particular database record (including the primary key field and its value).
