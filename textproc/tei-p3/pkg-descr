The DTD of the Text Encoding Initiative allows encoding of a wide range
of document types in the domain of humanities. If focuses on, but is not 
restricted to, the needs of the scholarly research and education community.

This port contains the TEI P3 DTD. It can be used to create documents that
conform to either SGML or XML.
