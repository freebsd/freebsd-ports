Elasticsearch DSL is a high-level library whose aim is to help with writing
and running queries against Elasticsearch. It is built on top of the official
low-level client (elasticsearch-py).

It provides a more convenient and idiomatic way to write and manipulate
queries. It stays close to the Elasticsearch JSON DSL, mirroring its terminology
and structure. It exposes the whole range of the DSL from Python either directly
using defined classes or a queryset-like expressions.

It also provides an optional wrapper for working with documents as Python
objects: defining mappings, retrieving and saving documents, wrapping the
document data in user-defined classes.

To use the other Elasticsearch APIs (eg. cluster health) just use the underlying
client.
