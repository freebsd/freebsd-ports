Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to
another, and a command-line tool that uses this library.  It can read
markdown and (subsets of) HTML, reStructuredText, LaTeX, DocBook,
MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, Haddock markup, OPML, Emacs Org-Mode,
txt2tags and Textile, and it can write markdown, reStructuredText,
XHTML, HTML 5, LaTeX, ConTeXt, DocBook, OPML, OpenDocument, ODT, Word
docx, RTF, MediaWiki, DokuWiki, Textile, groff man pages, plain text,
Emacs Org-Mode, AsciiDoc, Haddock markup, EPUB (v2 and v3),
FictionBook2, InDesign ICML, and several kinds of HTML/javascript
slide shows (S5, Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, reveal.js).

Pandoc extends standard markdown syntax with footnotes, embedded
LaTeX, definition lists, tables, and other features.  A compatibility
mode is provided for those who need a drop-in replacement for
Markdown.pl.

In contrast to existing tools for converting markdown to HTML, which
use regex substitutions, pandoc has a modular design: it consists of a
set of readers, which parse text in a given format and produce a
native representation of the document, and a set of writers, which
convert this native representation into a target format.  Thus, adding
an input or output format requires only adding a reader or writer.
