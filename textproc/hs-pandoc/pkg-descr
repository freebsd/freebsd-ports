Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to
another, and a command-line tool that uses this library.  It can read
markdown and (subsets of) HTML, reStructuredText, LaTeX, DocBook,
MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, Haddock markup, OPML, Emacs Org-Mode,
txt2tags and Textile, and it can write markdown, reStructuredText,
XHTML, HTML 5, LaTeX, ConTeXt, DocBook, OPML, OpenDocument, ODT, Word
docx, RTF, MediaWiki, DokuWiki, Textile, groff man pages, plain text,
Emacs Org-Mode, AsciiDoc, Haddock markup, EPUB (v2 and v3),
FictionBook2, InDesign ICML, and several kinds of HTML/javascript slide
shows (S5, Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, reveal.js).

Pandoc extends standard markdown syntax with footnotes, embedded LaTeX,
definition lists, tables, and other features.  A compatibility mode is
provided for those who need a drop-in replacement for Markdown.pl.

In contrast to existing tools for converting markdown to HTML, which use
regex substitutions, pandoc has a modular design: it consists of a set
of readers, which parse text in a given format and produce a native
representation of the document, and a set of writers, which convert this
native representation into a target format.  Thus, adding an input or
output format requires only adding a reader or writer.
