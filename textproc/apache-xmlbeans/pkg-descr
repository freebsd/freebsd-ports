XMLBeans is a technology for accessing XML by binding it to Java types. XMLBeans
provides several ways to get at the XML, including:

- Through XML schema that has been compiled to generate Java types that
  represent schema types. In this way, you can access instances of the schema
  through JavaBeans-style accessors after the fashion of "getFoo" and "setFoo".
  The XMLBeans API also allows you to reflect into the XML schema itself through
  an XML Schema Object model.

- A cursor model through which you can traverse the full XML infoset.

- Support for XML DOM.

This port contains also the OOXML Schemas, XmlBeans generated from the Ecma
supplied xsds.
