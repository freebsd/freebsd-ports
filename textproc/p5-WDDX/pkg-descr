This is a module that parses WDDX packets. Which are
well supported in Allaire Coldfusion, and pretty
useful.

This is from the WDDX.org web site: "The Web Distributed
Data Exchange, or WDDX, is a free, open XML-based
technology that allows Web applications created with any
platform to easily exchange data with one another over the
Web."
