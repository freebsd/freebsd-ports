This is a module that parses WDDX packets. Which are
well supported in Allaire Coldfusion, and pretty
useful.

This is from the WDDX.org web site: "The Web Distributed
Data Exchange, or WDDX, is a free, open XML-based
technology that allows Web applications created with any
platform to easily exchange data with one another over the
Web."

For more information about WDDX, visit

with WDDX (including examples) you can also visit
