Linux version of Aspell.

Aspell is a spelling checker designed to eventually replace ispell, although
it currently lacks many of ispell's basic functions. Aspell's main feature is
that it does a much better job of coming up with possible suggestions than
ispell. Aspell also includes a powerful C++ library with C and Perl interfaces
in the works.
