			<< wdiff >>

   From man page of wdiff:
       wdiff  compares  two  files, finding which words have been
       deleted or added to old_file to get new_file.  A  word  is
       anything  between whitespace.  The output is collected and
       used to produce an annotated copy of new_file on  standard
       output.  Suitable  annotations  produce  a nice display of
       word differences between the original files.

  Example:
	text-a
		I like FreeBSD.
	text-b
		I love FreeBSD.

	% wdiff -n text-a text-b
	I [-like-] {+love+} FreeBSD.
