Ah yes, INI files. We love them. We hate them. We cannot escape
them. Originally made popular by Windows, INI files are everywhere
including in Samba[www.samba.org] and Trac[trac.edgewall.org]. This
gem has one goal: make INI file, structure, and stream manipulation
as fast, safe, and simple as possible. We take a modal approach
with a pluggable parser class.
