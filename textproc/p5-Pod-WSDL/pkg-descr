How does Pod::WSDL work? If you instantiate a Pod::WSDL object with the
name of the module (or the path of the file, or an open filehandle)
providing the web service like this

	my $pwsdl = new Pod::WSDL(source => 'My::Module',
		location => 'http://my.services.location/on/the/web');

Pod::WSDL will try to find "My::Module" in @INC, open the file, parse it
for WSDL directives and prepare the information for WSDL output. By
calling

	$pwsdl->WSDL;

Pod::WSDL will output the WSDL document. That's it.
