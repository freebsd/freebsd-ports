Miller is like awk, sed, cut, join, and sort for data formats such as
CSV, TSV, JSON, JSON Lines, and positionally-indexed.

With Miller, you get to use named fields without needing to count
positional indices. Then, on the fly, you can add new fields which are
functions of existing fields, drop fields, sort, aggregate
statistically, pretty-print, and more.

Miller operates on key-value-pair data while the familiar Unix tools
operate on integer-indexed fields: if the natural data structure for the
latter is the array, then Miller's natural data structure is the
insertion-ordered hash map.
