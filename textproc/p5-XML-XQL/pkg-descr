This is a Perl extension to XML::Parser. It adds a new 'Style' to
XML::Parser, called 'Dom', that allows XML::Parser to build an Object
Oriented datastructure with a DOM Level 1 compliant interface.

The XML::XQL module implements the XQL (XML Query Language) proposal
submitted to the XSL Working Group in September 1998. The spec can
be found at

http://www.w3.org/TandS/QL/QL98/pp/xql.html

Most of the contents related to the XQL syntax can also be found
in the XML::XQL::Tutorial that comes with this distribution. Note
that XQL is not the same as XML-QL!
