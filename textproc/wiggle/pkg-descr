The main function of wiggle is to apply a patch to a file in a similar
manner to the patch(1) program.

The distinctive difference of wiggle is that it will attempt to apply a
patch even if the "before" part of the patch doesn't match the target
file perfectly. This is achieved by breaking the file and patch into
words and finding the best alignment of words in the file with words in
the patch. Once this alignment has been found, any differences (word-
wise) in the patch are applied to the file as best as possible.

Also, wiggle will (in some cases) detect changes that have already been
applied, and will ignore them.
