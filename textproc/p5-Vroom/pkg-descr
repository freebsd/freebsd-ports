Vroom lets you create your slides in a single file using a Wiki-like
style, much like Spork and Sporx do. The difference is that your slides
don't compile to HTML or JavaScript or XUL. They get turned into a set
of files that begin with '0', like '03' or '07c' or '05b.pl'.

The slides are named in alphabetic order. That means you can bring them
all into a Vim session with the command: vim 0*. vroom --vroom does
exactly that.

Vroom takes advantage of Vim's syntax highlighting. It also lets you run
slides that contain code.

Since Vim is an editor, you can change your slides during the show.
