KMFL aims to bring Tavultesoft Keyman functionality to *nix operating
systems. KMFL is being jointly developed by SIL International
(http://www.sil.org) and Tavultesoft (http://www.tavultesoft.com).

SCIM KMFL IMEngine allows you to use KMN keyboards (compiled with
textproc/kmflcomp) through standard SCIM interface.

The powerful KMN keyboard language supports contextual deadkeys,
pre- and post-processing of keystrokes, rules grouping, 'storing'
of character classes for use in similar rules, custom and Unicode
character constants, SIL Ethnologue language codes, etc.

Official Tavultesoft repository contains keyboards that cover more
than 220 languages. Significant number of them are open source.
Ported keyboards are textproc/scim-kmfl-*.
