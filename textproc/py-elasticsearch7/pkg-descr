Official low-level client for Elasticsearch. Its goal is to provide common
ground for all Elasticsearch-related code in Python; because of this it tries to
be opinion-free and very extendable.

For a more high level client library with more limited scope, have a look at
elasticsearch-dsl - a more pythonic library sitting on top of elasticsearch-py.

It provides a more convenient and idiomatic way to write and manipulate queries.
It stays close to the Elasticsearch JSON DSL, mirroring its terminology and
structure while exposing the whole range of the DSL from Python either directly
using defined classes or a queryset-like expressions.

It also provides an optional persistence layer for working with documents as
Python objects in an ORM-like fashion: defining mappings, retrieving and saving
documents, wrapping the document data in user-defined classes.
