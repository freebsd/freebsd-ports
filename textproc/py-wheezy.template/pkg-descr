wheezy.template is a python package written in pure Python code. It is a
lightweight template library. The design goals achieved:
- Compact, Expressive, Clean: Minimizes the number of keystrokes required to
  build a template. Enables fast and well read coding. You do not need to
  explicitly denote statement blocks within HTML (unlike other template
  systems), the parser is smart enough to understand your code. This enables a
  compact and expressive syntax which is really clean and just pleasure to type.
- Intuitive, No time to Learn: Basic Python programming skills plus HTML markup.
  You are productive just from start. Use full power of Python with minimal
  markup required to denote python statements.
- Do Not Repeat Yourself: Master layout templates for inheritance; include and
  import directives for maximum reuse.
- Blazingly Fast: Maximum rendering performance: ultimate speed and context
  preprocessor features.
