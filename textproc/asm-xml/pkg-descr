AsmXml is a very fast XML parser and decoder for x86 platforms.  It
achieves high speed by using the following features:

  * Support of an XML subset only
  * Written in pure assembler
  * Optimized memory accesses
  * Parsing and decoding at the same time

This parser is intended for applications that need intensive processing
of XML.  This project will likely appeal you if XML parsing is a
bottleneck in your data-flow.  It is expecially designed for bulk loads
into databases.

This is not an all-purpose library, it is not designed to be used with
DOM, SAX, XPath and so on.  Here, XML is just considered as an
interchange format, not as a working format.
