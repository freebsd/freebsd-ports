Acora is 'fgrep' for Python, a fast multi-keyword text search engine.
Based on a set of keywords, it generates a search automaton (DFA) and runs it
over string input, either unicode or bytes.  It is based on the Aho-Corasick
algorithm and an NFA-to-DFA powerset construction.  Acora comes with both a pure
Python implementation and a fast binary module written in Cython.  However, note
that the current construction algorithm is not suitable for really large sets of
keywords (i.e. more than a couple of thousand).
