Ispell is a fast screen-oriented spelling checker that shows you your
errors in the context of the original file, and suggests possible
corrections when it can figure them out.  Compared to UNIX spell, it
is faster and much easier to use.  Ispell can also handle languages
other than English.
Included in this port are:
	- Afrikaans
	- British English
	- Bulgarian
	- Danish
	- Dutch
	- Finnish
	- French
	- Brasilian
	- German (old and new spelling)
