When you think about software built for automated writing assistance, a
lot of assumptions probably come to mind. You have heard terms like
cloud-based, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. You have
been promised sophisticated, human-like feedback to dramatically
improve your writing.

Vale is none of that; it was not designed to be, and it does not try to be.
To put it succinctly, Vale does not teach you how to write, it is a tool for
writers.

This distinction is particularly important to understand because Vale
does not offer any of its own advice. Instead, it offers a framework for
creating and enforcing custom rules. Its approach is much more similar
to code linters than it is to traditional grammar checkers.
