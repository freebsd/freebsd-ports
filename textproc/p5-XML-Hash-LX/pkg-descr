This module is a companion for XML::LibXML. It operates with LibXML
objects, could return or accept LibXML objects, and may be used for
easy data transformations.

It is faster in parsing then XML::Simple, XML::Hash, XML::Twig and
of course much slower than XML::Bare.

It is faster in composing than XML::Hash, but slower than XML::Simple.
