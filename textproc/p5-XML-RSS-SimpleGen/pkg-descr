This module is for writing RSS files, simply. It transparently handles all
the unpleasant details of RSS, like proper XML escaping, and also has a good
number of Do-What-I-Mean features, like not changing the modtime on a
written-out RSS file if the file content hasn't changed, and like
automatically removing any HTML tags from content you might pass in.

This module isn't meant to have the full expressive power of RSS; instead, it
provides functions that are most commonly needed by RSS-writing programs.
