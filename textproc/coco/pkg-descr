This is port of coco.

coco runs as a filter for code conversion among
any coding-systems which Mule can handle.

m2ps converts *internal* code, which Mule
handles, to Postscript by using bdf files.

coco and m2ps are one of commands in Mule2.3.
But this port just install coco and m2ps,
not all of Mule2.3.
