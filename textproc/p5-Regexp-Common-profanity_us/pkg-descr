Instead of a dry technical overview, I am going to explain the structure of this
module based on its history. I consult at a company that generates customer
leads primarily by having websites that attract people (e.g. lowering loan
values, selling cars, buying real estate, etc.). For some reason we get more
than our fair share of profane leads. For this reason I was told to write a
profanity checker.

For the data that I was dealing with, the profanity was most often in the email
address or in the first or last name, so I naively started filtering profanity
with a set of regexps for that sort of data. Note that both names and email
addresses are unlike what you are reading now: they are not whitespace-separated
text, but are instead labels.

Therefore full support for profanity checking should work in 2 entirely
different contexts: labels (email, names) and text (what you are reading).
Because open-source is driven by demand and I have no need for detecting
profanity in text, only label is implemented at the moment. And you know the
next sentence: "patches welcome" :)
