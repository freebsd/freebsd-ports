Math::ConvexHull is a simple module that calculates convex hulls from a
set of points in 2D space. It is a straightforward implementation of the
algorithm known as Graham's scan which, with complexity of O(n*log(n)),
is the fastest known method of finding the convex hull of an arbitrary
set of points.  There are some methods of eliminating points that cannot
be part of the convex hull. These may or may not be implemented in a
future version.
