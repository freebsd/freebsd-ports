SUNDIALS is a SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers.
It consists of the following six solvers: CVODE, solves initial value problems
for ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems; CVODES, solves ODE systems and
includes sensitivity analysis capabilities (forward and adjoint); ARKODE, solves
initial value ODE problems with additive Runge-Kutta methods, include support
for IMEX methods; IDA, solves initial value problems for differential-algebraic
equation (DAE) systems; IDAS, solves DAE systems and includes sensitivity
analysis capabilities (forward and adjoint); KINSOL, solves nonlinear algebraic
systems.
