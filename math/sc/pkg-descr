The spreadsheet calculator sc is based on rectangular tables much like
a financial spreadsheet.  When invoked it presents you with a table
organized as rows and columns of cells.  If invoked without a file
argument, the table is initially empty.  Each cell may have associated
with it a numeric value, a label string, and/or an expression (formula)
which evaluates to a numeric value or label string, often based on other
cell values.
