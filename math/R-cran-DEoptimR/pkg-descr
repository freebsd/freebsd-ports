Differential Evolution (DE) stochastic algorithms for global
optimization of problems with and without constraints. The aim is
to curate a collection of its state-of-the-art variants that (1)
do not sacrifice simplicity of design, (2) are essentially tuning-free,
and (3) can be efficiently implemented directly in the R language.
Currently, it only provides an implementation of the 'jDE' algorithm
by Brest et al. (2006) <doi:10.1109/TEVC.2006.872133>.
