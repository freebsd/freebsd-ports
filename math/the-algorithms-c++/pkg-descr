TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus is a collection of open-source implementation of a
variety of algorithms implemented in C++ and licensed under MIT License.
These algorithms span a variety of topics from computer science, mathematics
and statistics, data science, machine learning, engineering, etc. The
implementations and the associated documentation are meant to provide a learning
resource for educators and students. Hence, one may find more than one
implementation for the same objective but using a different algorithm strategies
and optimizations.
