A collection of functions to create spatial weights matrix objects
from polygon contiguities, from point patterns by distance and
tesselations, for summarising these objects, and for permitting
their use in spatial data analysis, including regional aggregation
by minimum spanning tree; a collection of tests for spatial
autocorrelation, including global Moran's I, APLE, Geary's C,
Hubert/Mantel general cross product statistic, Empirical Bayes
estimates and Assuno/Reis Index, Getis/Ord G and multicoloured join
count statistics, local Moran's I and Getis/Ord G, saddlepoint
approximations and exact tests for global and local Moran's I; and
functions for estimating spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR)
lag and error models, impact measures for lag models, weighted and
unweighted SAR and CAR spatial regression models, semi-parametric
and Moran eigenvector spatial filtering, GM SAR error models, and
generalized spatial two stage least squares models.
