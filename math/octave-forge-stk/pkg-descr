The octave-forge package is the result of The GNU Octave Repositry project,
which is intended to be a central location for custom scripts, functions and
extensions for GNU Octave. contains the source for all the functions plus
build and install scripts.

This is stk.

 The STK is a (not so) Small Toolbox for Kriging. Its primary focus in on
 the interpolation/regression technique known as kriging, which is very
 closely related to Splines and Radial Basis Functions, and can be
 interpreted as a non-parametric Bayesian method using a Gaussian Process
 (GP) prior. The STK also provides tools for the sequential and
 non-sequential design of experiments. Even though it is, currently, mostly
 geared towards the Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE), the
 STK can be useful for other applications areas (such as Geostatistics,
 Machine Learning, Non-parametric Regression, etc.).
