Bit::Vector is an efficient C library which allows you to handle
bit vectors, sets (of integers), "big integer arithmetic" and
boolean matrices, all of arbitrary sizes.

The library is efficient (in terms of algorithmical complexity)
and therefore fast (in terms of execution speed) for instance
through the widespread use of divide-and-conquer algorithms.

The package also includes an object-oriented Perl module for
accessing the C library from Perl, and optionally features
overloaded operators for maximum ease of use.

The C library can nevertheless be used stand-alone, without Perl.
