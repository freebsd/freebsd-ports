PySparse extends the Python interpreter by a set of sparse matrix
types holding double precision values. PySparse also includes modules
that implement:

- iterative methods for solving linear systems of equations
- a set of standard preconditioners
- an interface to a direct solver for sparse linear systems of
  equations (SuperLU)
- a Jacobi-Davidson eigenvalue solver for the symmetric, generalised
  matrix eigenvalue problem (JDSYM)
