Audi (from latin: "listen") is an open source, header only, C++ library (exposed
to python in the pyaudi package) that implements the differential algebra of
Taylor truncated polynomials and a few algorithms useful for its applications
(Differential Intelligence, automatic differentiation, Taylor Models, etc.)
