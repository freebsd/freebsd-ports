plasTeX is a LaTeX document processing framework written entirely in Python. It
currently comes bundled with renderers for XHTML, DocBook, man pages, plain
text, as well as a way to simply dump the document to a generic form of XML.
Other renderers can be added as well and are planned for future releases.
