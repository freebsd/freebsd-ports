  This module provides an interface to over 150 functions of the 
  cephes math library of Stephen Moshier. No functions are exported 
  by default, but rather must be imported explicitly, as in

     use Math::Cephes qw(sin cos);

  There are a number of export tags defined which allow
  importing groups of functions.
