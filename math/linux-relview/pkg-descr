The RelView-System is an interactive tool for computer-supported
manipulation of relations represented as Boolean matrices or directed
graphs, especially for prototyping relational specifications and
programs. It is developed at the Department of Computer Science and
Applied Mathematics of Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel.
