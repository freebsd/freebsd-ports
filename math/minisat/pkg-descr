MiniSat is a minimalistic, open-source SAT solver, developed to help
researchers and developers alike to get started on SAT. It is released under
the MIT licence, and is currently used in a number of projects.

Some key features of MiniSat:

- Easy to modify. MiniSat is small and well-documented, and possibly also
well-designed, making it an ideal starting point for adapting SAT based
techniques to domain specific problems.

- Highly efficient. Winning all the industrial categories of the SAT 2005
competition, MiniSat is a good starting point both for future research in SAT,
and for applications using SAT.

- Designed for integration. MiniSat supports incremental SAT and has
mechanisms for adding non-clausal constraints. By virtue of being easy to
modify, it is a good choice for integrating as a backend to another tool, such
as a model checker or a more generic constraint solver.
