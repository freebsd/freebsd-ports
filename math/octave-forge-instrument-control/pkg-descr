The octave-forge package is the result of The GNU Octave Repository project,
which is intended to be a central location for custom scripts, functions and
extensions for GNU Octave. contains the source for all the functions plus
build and install scripts.

This is instrument-control.

 Low level I/O functions for serial, i2c, parallel, tcp, gpib, udp
and usbtmc interfaces.  Not vxi11 as there doesn't seem to be FreeBSD
support.
