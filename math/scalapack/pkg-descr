The ScaLAPACK (or Scalable LAPACK) library includes a subset of LAPACK routines
redesigned for distributed memory MIMD parallel computers. It is currently
written in a Single-Program-Multiple-Data style using explicit message
passing for interprocessor communication. It assumes matrices are laid out
in a two-dimensional block cyclic decomposition.
