Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and nonlinear least
squares problems. Five algorithmic paths each include a core subroutine and
an easy-to-use driver. The algorithms proceed either from an analytic
specification of the Jacobian matrix or directly from the problem functions.
The paths include facilities for systems of equations with a banded Jacobian
matrix, for least squares problems with a large amount of data, and for
checking the consistency of the Jacobian matrix with the functions
