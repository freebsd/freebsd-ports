The Num library implements integer arithmetic and rational arithmetic in
arbitrary precision.  It was split off the core OCaml distribution starting
with the 4.06.0 release.

New applications that need arbitrary-precision arithmetic should use the
Zarith library instead of the Num library, and older applications that
already use Num are encouraged to switch to Zarith.  Zarith delivers much
better performance than Num and has a nicer API.
