This module is an extension to the Math::Symbolic module. A basic
familiarity with that module is required.

The Math::Symbolic::Custom::Pattern module implements pattern matching
routines on Math::Symbolic trees. The patterns itself are constructed from
Math::Symbolic trees with just a few variables which have a special
meaning.

The module provides two interfaces. You can use the new() and match()
methods this class provides, or you can use the to_pattern() and
is_of_form() methods on any Math::Symbolic tree. (Exported by the
Math::Symbolic::Custom::Pattern::Export module. Refer to that module for
details on is_of_form().)
