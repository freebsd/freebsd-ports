                        LASPack (version 1.12.2)

LASPack is a package for solving large sparse systems of linear equations
like those which arise from discretization of partial differential equations.

Main features:

- The primary aim of LASPack is the implementation of efficient iterative
  methods for the solution of systems of linear equations.

- Beside the obligatory Jacobi, succesive over-relaxation, Chebyshev, and
  conjugate gradient solvers, LASPack contains selected state-of-the-art
  algorithms which are commonly used for large sparse systems:

  - CG-like methods for non-symmetric systems: CGN, GMRES, BiCG, QMR, CGS, and
    BiCGStab,
  - multilevel methods such as multigrid and conjugate gradient method
    preconditioned by multigrid and BPX preconditioners.
