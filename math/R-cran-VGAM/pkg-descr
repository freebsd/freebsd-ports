An implementation of about 6 major classes of statistical regression
models.At the heart of it are the vector generalized linear and
additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes, and the book "Vector Generalized
Linear and Additive Models: With an Implementation in R" (Yee, 2015)
gives details of the statistical framework and VGAM package. Currently
only fixed-effects models are implemented, i.e., no random-effects models.
