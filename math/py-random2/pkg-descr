Provides a Python 3 ported version of Python 2.7's 'random' module. It has also
been back-ported to work in Python 2.6.

In Python 3, the implementation of randrange() was changed, so that even with
the same seed you get different sequences in Python 2 and 3. Note that several
high-level functions such as randint() and choice() use randrange().
