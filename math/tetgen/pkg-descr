TetGen is a program for generating tetrahedral meshes for arbitrary 3D
domains. The main purpose of TetGen is to create high-quality tetrahedral
meshes for solving partial differential equations using finite element
and finite volume methods. This program, based on Delaunay methods,
currently generates meshes including exact constrained Delaunay
tetrahedralizations and quality (conforming Delaunay) meshes. For a 3D
point set, it generates its exact Delaunay tetrahedralization and convex
hull as well. The program is written in ANSI C++. It is highly portable,
it should be very easy to compile and run on all major computer systems.
It can be also used as a library embedded into other applications.
