nanoflann is a C++11 header-only library for building KD-Trees of datasets with
different topologies: R2, R3 (point clouds), SO(2) and SO(3) (2D and 3D rotation
groups). No support for approximate NN is provided. nanoflann does not require
compiling or installing. You just need to #include <nanoflann.hpp> in your code.

This library is a fork of the flann library by Marius Muja and David G. Lowe,
and born as a child project of MRPT. Following the original license terms,
nanoflann is distributed under the BSD license. Please, for bugs use the issues
button or fork and open a pull request.
