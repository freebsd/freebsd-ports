This is Math::BigInt::Pari, a plugin module for Math::BigInt that
replaces Math::BigInt's core math routines with Math::Pari routines.

This package contains a replacement (drop-in) module for Math::BigInt's core,
Math::BigInt::Calc.pm. It needs the new versions of Math::BigInt and
Math::BigFloat as they are from Perl 5.7.x onwards.
