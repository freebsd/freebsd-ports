Makes the qhull library (www.qhull.org) available in R, in a similar
manner as in Octave and MATLAB. Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay
triangulations, halfspace intersections about a point, Voronoi
diagrams, furthest-site Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site
Voronoi diagrams. It runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions.
It implements the Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull.
Qhull does not support constrained Delaunay triangulations, or mesh
generation of non-convex objects, but the package does include some
R functions that allow for this. Currently the package only gives
access to Delaunay triangulation and convex hull computation.
