When built with sbcl, maxima imposes a default memory limit of 512MiB on i386,
and 1GiB on amd64.  The limit can be changed by defining DYNAMIC_SPACE_SIZE
in the build environment.  The limit can be overridden later, at run-time,
via the -X or --lisp-options options, or by defining the environment variable
MAXIMA_LISP_OPTIONS.
