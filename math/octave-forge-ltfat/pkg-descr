The octave-forge package is the result of The GNU Octave Repositry project,
which is intended to be a central location for custom scripts, functions and
extensions for GNU Octave. contains the source for all the functions plus
build and install scripts.

This is ltfat.

 The Large Time/Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) is a Matlab/Octave toolbox
 for working with time-frequency analysis, wavelets and signal processing. It
 is intended both as an educational and a computational tool. The toolbox
 provides a large number of linear transforms including Gabor and wavelet
 transforms along with routines for constructing windows (filter prototypes)
 and routines for manipulating coefficients.
