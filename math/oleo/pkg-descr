`Oleo' has more than one user interface.  The traditional `oleo'
environment shows a curses based (character mode) user interface.  
A bare bones user interface based on the X Window System exists as of
version 1.6 which dates back to 1994.  In 1998, development started for
a `motif' based user interface.  It should be more user friendly than
the character based UI.
