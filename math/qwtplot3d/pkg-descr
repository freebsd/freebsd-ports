QwtPlot3D is not a  program, but a feature-rich Qt/OpenGL-based C++ programming
library. She provides essentially a  bunch of 3D-widgets for programmers.

Features
    * Parametric Surfaces
    * Lighting (experimental)
    * User defined visual objects
    * Scaling, rotating, shifting, zooming of data sets and mathematical
      functions
    * Interactive mouse and keyboard handling
    * Resolution changing on the fly
    * Reading from MESH data files
    * Data structures providing nodes and triangulation
    * Reading from FEM files
    * Flat (2D) labeling
    * Wireframe, filled polygons, hidden line
    * Floor projections (Isolines, Data)
    * Free configurable (labeling, numbering; linear, log or user-defined
      transformations) and autoscalable axes
    * Free color model
    * Flat/Gouraud shading 
    * Color legends
    * Pixmap output (all Qt supported formats)
    * Vector output (PostScript,  EPS and PDF) via gl2ps
