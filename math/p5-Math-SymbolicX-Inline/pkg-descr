This module is an extension to the Math::Symbolic module. A basic 
familiarity with that module is required.

Math::SymbolicX::Inline allows easy creation of Perl functions from 
symbolic expressions in the context of Math::Symbolic. That means you can 
define arbitrary Math::Symbolic trees (including derivatives) and let this 
module compile them to package subroutines.
