This module is an extension to the Math::Symbolic module. A basic
familiarity with that module is required.

Math::SymbolicX::Inline allows easy creation of Perl functions from
symbolic expressions in the context of Math::Symbolic. That means you can
define arbitrary Math::Symbolic trees (including derivatives) and let this
module compile them to package subroutines.
