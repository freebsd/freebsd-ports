This software calculates a normalized version of the classical spectral test for
linear congruential pseudorandom number generators (LCGs), where the shortest
vector is replaced by an approximation obtained with the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz
basis reduction algorithm, which can be calculated in polynomial time. The code
is able to test in up to 24 dimensions, and includes an example of how to use
the test to search for good LCG parameters.
