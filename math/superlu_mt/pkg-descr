		SuperLU_MT (version 3.1)
		========================

SuperLU_MT contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear system
A*X=B. It uses Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP).
The columns of A may be preordered before factorization; the
preordering for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization.

SuperLU_MT is a parallel extension to the serial SuperLU library.
SuperLU_MT is implemented in ANSI C, with multithreading extension,
for example, using POSIX threads or OpenMP. Currently, only the LU
factorization routine, which is the most time-consuming part of the
solution process, is parallelized on machines with a shared address space.
The other routines, such as column preordering and the forward and
back substitutions are performed sequentially.
The library provides functionality for both real and complex
matrices, in both single and double precision.
