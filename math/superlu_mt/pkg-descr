			SuperLU_MT (version 1.0)
			========================

SuperLU_MT contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear system 
A*X=B. It uses Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP). 
The columns of A may be preordered before factorization; the 
preordering for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization.

SuperLU_MT is a parallel extension to the serial SuperLU library.
SuperLU_MT is implemented in ANSI C, with multithreading extension,
for example, using POSIX threads. Currently, only the LU factorization 
routine, which is the most time-consuming part of the solution process, 
is parallelized on machines with a shared address space. The other
routines, such as column preordering and the forward and back substitutions
are performed sequentially. This "alpha" release contains only 
double-precision real data type.
