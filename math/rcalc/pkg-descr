rCalc is a symbolic calculator for GNOME, featuring: 

  * Standard infix expressions - you type something like
    1+3*sin(pi) and it will be evaluated for you in the
    correct order. 
  * Variables (this is where the `symbolic' comes in).
    If you enter an expression like a=1+e^2.5, then the
    result is stored in a variable called a.  You can
    then use it in future expressions, like b=sqrt(a*5). 
  * Furthermore, variables are stored between sessions
    unless you delete them.
