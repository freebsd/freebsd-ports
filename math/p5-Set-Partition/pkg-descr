Set::Partition takes a list or hash of elements and a list numbers that
represent the sizes of the partitions into which the list of elements
should be arranged.

The resulting object can then be used as an iterator which returns a
reference to an array of lists, that represents the original list arranged
according to the given partitioning. All possible arrangements are
returned, and the object returns undef when the entire combination space
has been exhausted.
