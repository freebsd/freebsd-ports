pyFFTW is a pythonic wrapper around FFTW, the speedy FFT library. The ultimate
aim is to present a unified interface for all the possible transforms that FFTW
can perform.

Both the complex DFT and the real DFT are supported, as well as on arbitrary
axes of abitrary shaped and strided arrays, which makes it almost feature
equivalent to standard and real FFT functions of numpy.fft (indeed, it supports
the clongdouble dtype which numpy.fft does not).
