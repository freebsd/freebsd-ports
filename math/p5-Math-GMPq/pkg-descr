Math::GMPq is a bigrational module utilising the GNU MP (GMP) library. Basically
this module simply wraps all of the mpq rational functions provided by that
library. See the Math::GMPq test suite for some examples of usage.

IMPORTANT:
If your perl was built with '-Duse64bitint' you need to assign all integers
larger than 52-bit in a 'use integer;' block. Failure to do so can result in the
creation of the variable as an NV (rather than an IV) - with a resultant loss of
precision.
