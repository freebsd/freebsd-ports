CyLP is a Python interface to COIN-OR's Linear and mixed-integer program solvers
(CLP, CBC, and CGL). CyLP's unique feature is that you can use it to alter the
solution process of the solvers from within Python. For example, you may define
cut generators, branch-and-bound strategies, and primal/dual Simplex pivot rules
completely in Python.
