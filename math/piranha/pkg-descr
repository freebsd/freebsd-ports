Piranha is a computer-algebra library for the symbolic manipulation of sparse
multivariate polynomials and other closely-related symbolic objects (such as
Poisson series).

Piranha is written in modern C++, with emphasis on portability, correctness and
performance. Piranha also includes a set of optional bindings for the Python
programming language, called Pyranha, that allow to use the library in an
interactive and script-oriented way.
