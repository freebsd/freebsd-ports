Math::BigInt::GMP - Use the GMP library for Math::BigInt routines.

Provides support for big integer calculations via means of the GMP c-library.

Math::BigInt::GMP now no longer uses Math::GMP, but provides its own XS layer
to access the GMP c-library. This cuts out another (perl sub routine) layer and
also reduces the memory footprint by not loading Math::GMP and Carp at all.
