reformulas (random effects formulas) is a utility package for
processing "lme4-style" random effects formulas in R (i.e.,
formulas where the random effects are included in the form (f|g)
as components of an overall model formula, where f represents a
sub-formula for the varying effects and g represents a sub-formula
for the grouping variable(s).
