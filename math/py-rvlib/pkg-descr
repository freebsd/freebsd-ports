Anyone who has used Distributions.jl will tell you how nice the interface is
relative to the "exotic" (the most polite word we can think of) interface to
distributions exposed by scipy.stats. Distributions.jl also brings better
performace, particularly when its methods are used inside loops.

For these reason we've put together rvlib, which mimics the interface of
Distributions.jl, while at the same time attaining similar performance by
exploiting numba.

This package was inspired by Joshua Adelman's (@synapticarbors) blog post
describing how to call the Rmath C library from numba using CFFI, and utilizes
his build script to set up the CFFI interface.
