islpy is a Python wrapper around Sven Verdoolaege's isl, a library for
manipulating sets and relations of integer points bounded by linear
constraints.

Supported operations on sets include:
* intersection, union, set difference,
* emptiness check,
* convex hull,
* (integer) affine hull,
* integer projection,
* computing the lexicographic minimum using parametric integer programming,
* coalescing,
* parametric vertex enumeration.

It also includes an ILP solver based on generalized basis reduction, transitive
closures on maps (which may encode infinite graphs), dependence analysis and
bounds on piecewise step-polynomials.
