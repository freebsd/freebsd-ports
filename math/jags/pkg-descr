JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler -- a program for Bayesian analysis of
graphical models via Gibbs Sampling, not wholly unlike classic BUGS.

The functionality of JAGS is based on the BUGS program created by the
MRC Biostatistics Unit (http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/). There is a short
manual that describes the differences between JAGS and BUGS.

The manual is installed as /usr/local/share/doc/jags/manual.pdf.

Some of the BUGS examples have been modified to run with JAGS, and have
been turned into a test suite.  They are installed under
/usr/local/share/examples/jags/.
