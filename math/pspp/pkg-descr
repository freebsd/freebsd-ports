PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. It
interprets commands in the SPSS language and produces tabular output
in ASCII or PostScript format.

PSPP development is ongoing. It already supports a large subset of
SPSS's transformation language.  Its statistical procedure support is
currently limited, but growing.
