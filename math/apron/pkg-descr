The APRON library is dedicated to the static analysis of the numerical variables
of a program by Abstract Interpretation. The aim of such an analysis is to infer
invariants about these variables. like 1<=x+y<=z, which holds during any
execution of the program. You may look at to the Interproc analyzer for an
online demonstration of static analysis.

The APRON library is intended to be a common interface to various underlying
libraries/abstract domains and to provide additional services that can be
implemented independently from the underlying library/abstract domain.
