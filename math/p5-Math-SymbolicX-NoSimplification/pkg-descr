This module offers facilities to turn off the builtin Math::Symbolic
simplification routines and replace them with routines that just clone the
objects. You may want to do this in cases where the simplification
routines fail to simplify the Math::Symbolic trees and waste a lot of CPU
time. (For example, calculating the first order Taylor polynomial of a
moderately complex test function was sped up by 100% on my machine.)

A word of caution, however: If you turn off the simplification routines,
some procedures may produce very, very large trees. One such procedure
would be the consecutive application of many derivatives to a product
without intermediate simplification. This would yield exponential growth
of nodes. (And may, in fact, still do if you keep the simplification
heuristics turned on because most expressions cannot be simplified
significantly.)
