ltl2ba implements an algorithm of P. Gastin and D. Oddoux to generate
Buchi automata from linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae. This
algorithm generates a very weak alternating automaton and then
transforms it into a Buchi automaton, using a generalized Buchi
automaton as an intermediate step. Each automaton is simplified
on-the-fly in order to save memory and time. As usual the LTL formula
is simplified before any treatment. ltl2ba is more efficient than
Spin 3.4.1, with regard to the size of the resulting automaton,
the time of the computation, and the memory used.
