The octave-forge package is the result of The GNU Octave Repository project,
which is intended to be a central location for custom scripts, functions and
extensions for GNU Octave. contains the source for all the functions plus
build and install scripts.

This is geographiclib.

 Native Octave/MATLAB implementations of a subset of the C++ library,
GeographicLib. Key components of this toolbox are: (a) Geodesics, direct,
inverse, area calculations; (b) Projections, transverse Mercator, polar
stereographic, etc; (c) Grid systems, UTM, UPS, MGRS; (d) Geoid lookup, egm84,
egm96, egm2008 geoids supported; (e) Geometric transformations, geocentric,
local cartesian; (f) Great ellipse, direct, inverse, area calculations.
