The SDPARA (SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm PARAllel version) is a
parallel version of the SDPA. C++ source codes of the SDPARA are
available in this homepage. They form a stand-alone software package for
solving SDPs in parallel with the help of MPI (Message Passing
Interface) and ScaLAPACK (Scalable LAPACK). However callable libraries
of the SDPARA, which could be used combinedly with other C++ programs,
are not available. We assume that you know how to use the latest version
of the SDPA and MPICH.
