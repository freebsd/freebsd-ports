The SDPARA (SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm PARAllel version) is a parallel
version of the SDPA. C++ source codes of the SDPARA are available in
this homepage. They form a stand-alone software package for solving SDPs in
parallel with the help of MPI (Message Passing Interface) and ScaLAPACK
(Scalable LAPACK). However callable libraries of the SDPARA, which could be
used combinedly with other C++ programs, are not available.
We assume that you know how to use the latest version of the SDPA and MPICH.
