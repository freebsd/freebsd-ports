GPA Rotation for Factor Analysis

The GPArotation package contains functions for the rotation of factor loadings
matrices. The functions implement Gradient Projection (GP) algorithms for
orthogonal and oblique rotation. Additionally, a number of rotation criteria
are provided. The GP algorithms minimize the rotation criterion function, and
provide the corresponding rotation matrix. For oblique rotation, the
covariance/correlation matrix of the factors is also provided.
