This port installs the module CHOLMOD of SuiteSparse.

CHOLMOD is a set of routines for factorizing sparse symmetric positive definite
matrices of the form A or AA', updating/downdating a sparse Cholesky
factorization, solving linear systems, updating/downdating the solution to the
triangular system Lx=b, and many other sparse matrix functions for both
symmetric and unsymmetric matrices. Its supernodal Cholesky factorization relies
on LAPACK and the Level-3 BLAS, and obtains a substantial fraction of the peak
performance of the BLAS. Both real and complex matrices are supported.
