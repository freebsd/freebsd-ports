This class is a subclass of Number::WithError. It provides the same 
interface and the same exports.

It adds several methods to every object. The main functionality is 
provided by latex(), which dumps the object as valid LaTeX code. Also, 
encode() is a convenient way to encode any UTF-8 string into TeX. It is 
just a convenience thing since it is delegated to TeX::Encode.

Unlike Number::WithError, this module requires perl version 5.8 or later. 
(That is the rationale for creating a separate distribution, too.)
