An extremely fast and flexible C++ simulation engine and differential equation
solver.

Ascent's integration algorithms are designed for speed, and outperform boost's
odeint in both Debug and Release.

Features:
* Header Only
* Automatic Vectorization: Ascent conforms to vectorization standards
  (such as Intel's)
* Modular (Optional): solve systems in an object-oriented manner
* Variable Tracking: Optimized recording of variable time history
* Asynchronous Sampling and Event Scheduling
* Multiple Integration Algorithms (In Progress): adaptive steppers,
  predictor-correctors, etc.
* Use boost's odeint library as the numerical integration engine
* Scripting Interface: Optional ChaiScript interface to easily script
  simulations
