librsb is a library for sparse matrix computations featuring the Recursive
Sparse Blocks (RSB) matrix format. This format allows cache efficient and
multi-threaded (that is, shared memory parallel) operations on large sparse
matrices. The most common operations necessary to iterative solvers are
available, e.g.: matrix-vector multiplication, triangular solution,
rows/columns scaling, diagonal extraction / setting, blocks extraction, norm
computation, formats conversion. The RSB format is especially well suited
for symmetric and transposed multiplication variants. Most numerical kernels
code is auto generated, and the supported numerical types can be chosen by
the user at build time.

librsb implements the Sparse BLAS standard, as specified in the BLAS Forum
documents.
