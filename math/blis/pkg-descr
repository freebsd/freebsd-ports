software framework for high-performance BLAS-like libraries

BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating high-performance
BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. The framework was designed
to isolate essential kernels of computation that, when optimized,
immediately enable optimized implementations of most of its commonly
used and computationally intensive operations.
