	VTK - the Visualization Toolkit is an object oriented, high
level library that allows one to easily write programs in C++, Tcl,
Python and Java that do 3D visualization. 

        VTK enables users to concentrate on their work by providing a
large number of excellent and feature packed high level functions that
do visualization.  The library needs OpenGL to render the graphics and
for FreeBSD machines Mesa is necessary.
