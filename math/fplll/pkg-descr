fplll contains implementations of several lattice algorithms. The implementation
relies on floating-point orthogonalization, and LLL is central to the code,
hence the name.

It includes implementations of floating-point LLL reduction algorithms, offering
different speed/guarantees ratios. It contains a 'wrapper' choosing the
estimated best sequence of variants in order to provide a guaranteed output as
fast as possible. In the case of the wrapper, the succession of variants is
oblivious to the user.

It includes an implementation of the BKZ reduction algorithm, including the
BKZ-2.0 improvements (extreme enumeration pruning, pre-processing of blocks,
early termination). Additionally, Slide reduction and self dual BKZ are
supported.
