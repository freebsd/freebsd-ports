An optimized C library for EC operations on curve secp256k1.

This library is a work in progress and is being used to research best practices.
Use at your own risk.

Features:
 - secp256k1 ECDSA signing/verification and key generation.
 - Adding/multiplying private/public keys.
 - Serialization/parsing of private keys, public keys, signatures.
 - Constant time, constant memory access signing and pubkey generation.
 - Derandomized DSA (via RFC6979 or with a caller provided function.)
 - Very efficient implementation.
