This module was adapted from Math::Vector.

It uses most of the same algorithms, and currently preserves the same
names as the original functions, though some aliases have been added
to make the interface more natural.

The "object" for the object oriented calling style is a blessed array
reference which contains a vector of the form [x,y,z]. Methods will
typically return a list.
