This package contains functions to perform Bayesian inference using
posterior simulation for a number of statistical models. Most
simulation is done in compiled C++ written in the Scythe Statistical
Library Version 1.0.3. All models return coda mcmc objects that can
then be summarized using the coda package. Some useful utility
functions such as density functions, pseudo-random number generators
for statistical distributions, a general purpose Metropolis sampling
algorithm, and tools for visualization are provided.
