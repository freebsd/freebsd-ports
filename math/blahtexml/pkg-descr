Blahtex is a program written in C++, which converts an equation given in a
syntax close to TeX into MathML. It is designed by David Harvey and is aimed at
supporting equations in MediaWiki.

Blahtexml is a simple extension of blahtex, written by Gilles Van Assche. In
addition to the functionality of blahtex, blahtexml has XML processing in mind
and is able to process a whole XML document into another XML document. Instead
of converting only one formula at a time, blahtexml can convert all the formulas
of the given XML file into MathML.
