Fityk is a program for nonlinear fitting of analytical functions
(especially peak-shaped) to data (usually experimental data). There are
also people using it only to display data or to remove baseline from
data.

It is reported to be used in crystallography, chromatography,
photoluminescence, infrared and Raman spectroscopy and other fields.

Fityk knows about common peak-shaped functions (Gaussian, Lorentzian,
Voigt, Pearson VII, bifurcated Gaussian, EMG, Doniach-Sunjic, etc.) and
polynomials. It also supports user-defined functions.

Fityk offers intuitive graphical interface (and also command line
interface), variouse optimization methods (standard Marquardt
least-square algorithm, Genetic Algorithms, Nelder-Mead simplex),
equality constraints, modelling error of x coordinate of points (eg.
zero-shift of instrument), handling series of datasets, automation of
common tasks with scripts, and more.
