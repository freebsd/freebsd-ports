Another Python Graph Library is a simple, fast and easy to use graph library
with some machine learning features. The main features are as follows:

    * Directed, undirected and multigraphs designed under a hierarchical
class structure
    * Sparse and Dense graph structures using numpy and scipy for fast linear
algebra computations
    * Many operations on graphs such as subgraphs, search, Floyd-Warshall,
Dijkstras algorithm
    * Erdos-Renyi, Small-World and Albert-Barabasi random graphs
    * Write to Pajek, and simple CSV files
    * Some machine learning features - data preprocessing, kernels, PCA, KCCA,
wrappers for LibSVM, and some mlpy learning algorithms
    * Unit tested using the Python unittest framework
