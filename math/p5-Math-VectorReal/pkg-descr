The Math::VectorReal package defines a 3D mathematical "vector",
in a way that is compatible with the previous CPAN module
Math::MatrixReal. However it provides a more vector oriented set
of mathematical functions and overload operators, to the MatrixReal
package. For example the normal perl string functions "x" and "."
have been overloaded to allow vector cross and dot product
operations. Vector math formula thus looks like vector math formula
in perl programs using this package.
