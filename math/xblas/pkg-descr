This library of routines is part of a reference implementation for the Dense
and Banded BLAS routines, along with their Extended and Mixed Precision
versions, as documented in Chapters 2 and 4 of the new BLAS Standard.

EXTENDED PRECISION is only used internally; the input and output arguments
remain the same as in the existing BLAS.  At present, we only allow Single,
Double, or Extra internal precision.  Extra precision is implemented as
double-double precision (128-bit total, 106-bit significand).  The routines
for the double-double precision basic arithmetic operations +, -, *, / were
developed by David Bailey.

We have designed all our routines assuming that single precision arithmetic
is actually done in IEEE single precision (32 bits) and that double precision
arithmetic is actually done in IEEE double precision (64 bits). The routines
also pass our tests on an Intel machine with 80-bit floating point registers.

MIXED PRECISION permits some input/output arguments to be of different types
(mixing real and complex) or precisions (mixing single and double).
