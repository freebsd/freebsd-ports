bcal (Byte CALculator) is a REPL CLI utility for storage expressions, unit
conversions or address calculations. If you can't calculate the hex address
offset for (512 - 16) MiB, or the value when the 43rd bit of a 64-bit address
is set mentally, bcal is for you.

It has a bc mode for general-purpose numerical calculations.

bcal follows Ubuntu's standard unit conversion and notation policy. Only 64-bit
operating systems are supported.

Features:

- evaluate arithmetic expressions involving storage units
- perform general purpose calculations (using bc)
- convert to IEC/SI standard data storage units
- interactive mode with the last valid result stored for reuse
- show the address in bytes
- show address as LBA:OFFSET
- convert CHS to LBA and vice versa
- base conversion to binary, decimal and hex
- custom sector size, max heads/cylinder and max sectors/track
- minimal dependencies
