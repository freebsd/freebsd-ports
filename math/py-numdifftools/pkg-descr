The numdifftools library is a suite of tools written in _Python to solve
automatic numerical differentiation problems in one or more variables. Finite
differences are used in an adaptive manner, coupled with a Richardson
extrapolation methodology to provide a maximally accurate result. The user can
configure many options like; changing the order of the method or the
extrapolation, even allowing the user to specify whether complex-step, central,
forward or backward differences are used.
