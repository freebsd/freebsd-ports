One of the aims of this package is to make life easier for useRs
who deal with survey data sets. It provides an infrastructure for
the management of survey data including value labels, definable
missing values, recoding of variables, production of code books,
and import of (subsets of) SPSS and Stata files. Further, it provides
functionality to produce tables and data frames of arbitrary
descriptive statistics and (almost) publication-ready tables of
regression model estimates. Also some convenience tools for graphics,
programming, and simulation are provided.
