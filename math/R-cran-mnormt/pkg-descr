Functions are provided for computing the density and the distribution function
of d-dimensional normal and "t" random variables, possibly truncated (on one
side or two sides), and for generating random vectors sampled from these
distributions, except sampling from the truncated "t". Moments of arbitrary
order of a multivariate truncated normal are computed, and converted to
cumulants up to order 4. Probabilities are computed via non-Monte Carlo methods;
different routines are used in the case d=1, d=2, d=3, d>3, if d denotes the
dimensionality.
