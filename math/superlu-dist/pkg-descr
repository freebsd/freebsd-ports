SuperLU_DIST contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear system
A*X=B. It uses Gaussian elimination with static pivoting (GESP). Static pivoting
is a technique that combines the numerical stability of partial pivoting with
the scalability of Cholesky (no pivoting), to run accurately and efficiently on
large numbers of processors.

SuperLU_DIST is a parallel extension to the serial SuperLU library. It is
targeted for the distributed memory parallel machines. SuperLU_DIST is
implemented in ANSI C, with OpenMP for on-node parallelism and MPI for off-node
communications. We are actively developing GPU acceleration capabilities.
