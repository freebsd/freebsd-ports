Savage is a new computer algebra system written from scratch in pure
Rust. Its goals are correctness, simplicity, and usability, in that
order.

Features:

 - Arbitrary-precision integer, rational, and complex arithmetic
 - Input, simplification, and evaluation of symbolic expressions
 - First-class support for vectors and matrices, with coefficients
   being arbitrary expressions
 - REPL with syntax and bracket highlighting, persistent history,
   and automatic multi-line input
 - Macro-based system for defining functions with metadata and
   automatic type checking
 - Usable as a library from any Rust program
