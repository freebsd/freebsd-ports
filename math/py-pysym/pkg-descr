pysym is an experimental Python package for symbolic manipulation with limited
scope (as in minimal). It tries to stay compatible with the API of SymPy. It
should be viewed as a prototype and not as a "production" package.

The capabilities include:
* Differentiation
* (slow) numerical evaluation (including "lambdify" support)
