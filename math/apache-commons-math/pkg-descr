Commons Math is a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics and
statistics components addressing the most common problems not available in the
Java programming language or Commons Lang.

Guiding principles:

 * Real-world application use cases determine development priority.
 * This package emphasizes small, easily integrated components rather than
	large libraries with complex dependencies and configurations.
 * All algorithms are fully documented and follow generally accepted best
	practices.
 * In situations where multiple standard algorithms exist, a Strategy pattern
	is used to support multiple implementations.
 * Limited dependencies. No external dependencies beyond Commons components
	and the core Java platform.
