+[gui_support]
+# Matplotlib supports multiple GUI toolkits, including Cocoa,
+# GTK, Fltk, MacOSX, Qt, Qt4, Tk, and WX. Support for many of
+# these toolkits requires AGG, the Anti-Grain Geometry library,
+# which is provided by matplotlib and built by default.
+#
+# Some backends are written in pure Python, and others require
+# extension code to be compiled. By default, matplotlib checks
+# for these GUI toolkits during installation and, if present,
+# compiles the required extensions to support the toolkit. GTK
+# support requires the GTK runtime environment and PyGTK. Wx
+# support requires wxWidgets and wxPython. Tk support requires
+# Tk and Tkinter. The other GUI toolkits do not require any
+# extension code, and can be used as long as the libraries are
+# installed on your system.
+#
+# You can uncomment any the following lines if you know you do
+# not want to use the GUI toolkit. Acceptible values are:
+#     True: build the extension. Exits with a warning if the
+#           required dependencies are not available
+#     False: do not build the extension
+#     auto: build if the required dependencies are available,
+#           otherwise skip silently. This is the default
+#           behavior
