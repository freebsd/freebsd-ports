SCIP is currently one of the fastest non-commercial solvers for mixed integer
programming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). It is also
a framework for constraint integer programming and branch-cut-and-price. It
allows for total control of the solution process and the access of detailed
information down to the guts of the solver.

Features:
* very fast standalone solver for linear programming (LP), mixed integer
  programming (MIP), and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)
* framework for branching, cutting plane separation, pricing, and propagation
* large C-API, C++ wrapper classes for user plugins
* interfaces to other applications and programming languages
* open LP solver support
* highly flexible through many possible user plugins
