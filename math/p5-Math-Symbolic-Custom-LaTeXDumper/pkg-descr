This class provides the to_latex() method for all Math::Symbolic trees. It
is a rewrite of the to_latex() method that was supplied by Math::Symbolic
prior to version 0.201.

For details on how the custom method delegation model works, please have a
look at the Math::Symbolic::Custom and Math::Symbolic::Custom::Base
classes.
