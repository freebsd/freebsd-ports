ViennaCL is a free open-source linear algebra library for computations on
many-core architectures (GPUs, MIC) and multi-core CPUs. The library is
written in C++ and supports CUDA, OpenCL, and OpenMP (including switches
at runtime).

The highlights of the latest 1.7.x release family are:

* Fast sparse matrix-matrix multiplications, outperforming CUBLAS and MKL.
* Fine-grained parallel algebraic multigrid preconditioners for CPUs, Xeon
    Phis, and GPUs.
* Fine-grained parallel incomplete LU factorization preconditioners for
    CPUs, Xeon Phis, and GPUs.
