This library provides Python functions for hierarchical clustering. It generates
hierarchical clusters from distance matrices or from vector data.

Part of this module is intended to replace the functions (linkage, single,
complete, average, weighted, centroid, median, ward) in the module
scipy.cluster.hierarchy with the same functionality but much faster algorithms.
Moreover, the function linkage_vector provides memory-efficient clustering for
vector data.

The interface is very similar to MATLAB's Statistics Toolbox API to make code
easier to port from MATLAB to Python/NumPy. The core implementation of this
library is in C++ for efficiency.
