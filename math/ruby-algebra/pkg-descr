This is a Ruby library for mathematical (algebraic) computations.  Our
purpose is to express mathematical objects naturally in Ruby.  Though
it does not operate fast, we can see the algorithm of the mathematical
processing not in a black box but in scripts.

Things Ruby/Algebra offers include the following:

- One-variate polynomial
	o Fundamental operations (addition, multiplication,
	  quotient/remainder, ...)
	o Factorization

- Multi-variate polynomial
	o Fundamental operations (addition, multiplication, ...)
	o Creating Groebner-basis, quotient/remainder by Groebner-basis.

- Algebraic systems
	o Creating quotient fields
	o Creating residue class fields
	o Operating matrices
