Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics studying the enumeration,
combination, and permutation of sets of elements and the mathematical
relations that characterize their properties. As a jumping off point,

This module provides a pure-perl implementation of nCk, nPk, and n!
(combination, permutation, and factorial, respectively).
