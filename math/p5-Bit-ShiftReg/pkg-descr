Bit::ShiftReg is a perl module that implements rotate left, rotate
right, arithmetic shift left, and logical shift right operations with
carry flag for all C integer types.  The results depend on the
number of bits with that the integer types unsigned char, unsigned
short, unsigned int, and unsigned long have on your machine.  The
module automatically determines the number of bits of each integer
type and adjusts its internal constants accordingly.
