Why3 is a platform for deductive program verification. It provides a rich
language for specification and programming, called WhyML, and relies on
external theorem provers, both automated and interactive, to discharge
verification conditions. Why3 comes with a standard library of logical
theories (integer and real arithmetic, Boolean operations, sets and maps,
etc.) and basic programming data structures (arrays, queues, hash tables,
etc.). A user can write WhyML programs directly and get correct-by-
construction OCaml programs through an automated extraction mechanism.
WhyML is also used as an intermediate language for the verification of C,
Java, or Ada programs.

Why3 is a complete reimplementation of the former Why platform. Among the
new features are: numerous extensions to the input language, a new
architecture for calling external provers, and a well-designed API,
allowing to use Why3 as a software library. An important emphasis is put
on modularity and genericity, giving the end user a possibility to easily
reuse Why3 formalizations or to add support for a new external prover if
wanted.
