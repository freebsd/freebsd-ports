Femlab is built up by several different programs. Currently the 
X11-interface, a meshgenerator and one solver. These programs communicate
with each other with two ASCII files called "area.scratch" and
"solu.scratch". The programs reside in FEMLAB_HOME/bin. These allows you
to for instance run the solver directly from the csh as a batch job. The
aim is to provide more solvers for different applications, such as 2D
incompressible flow problems, transient problems etc. It should also be
possible to use the X11 interface for your own applications.
