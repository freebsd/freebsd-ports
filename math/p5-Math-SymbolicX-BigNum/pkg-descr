This module adds big number support to Math::Symbolic. It does so by
extending the parser of the Math::Symbolic module (that is, the one stored
in $Math::Symbolic::Parser) with certain special functions that create
arbitrary precision constants. (Math::Symbolic::Variable objects have been
able to contain arbitrary precision objects since the very beginning.)
