The Template Matrix/Vector (TMV) Library is a C++ class library designed to
make writing code with vectors and matrices both transparent and fast.
Transparency means that when you look at your code months later, it is obvious
what the code does, making it easier to debug. Fast means the execution time of
the code should be as fast as possible - this is mostly algorithm dependent, so
we want the underlying library code to use the fastest algorithms possible.
