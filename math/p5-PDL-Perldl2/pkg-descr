The pdl2 program, also known as the Perldl2 shell, is a second generation
version of the original perldl interactive PDL shell. It attempts to be backward
compatible in usage while providing improved features, better support for Perl
syntax, and an more easily extended framework based on the Devel::REPL shell.

By default, command lines beginning with the default prompt of either pdl2 or
perldl (one of 'pdl> ', 'PDL> ', or 'perldl> ') will have the prefix string and
surrounding whitespace stripped. This allows for easy cut-and-paste from sample
PDL shell sessions or other examples into another PDL shell session.
