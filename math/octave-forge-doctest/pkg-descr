The octave-forge package is the result of The GNU Octave Repositry project,
which is intended to be a central location for custom scripts, functions and
extensions for GNU Octave. contains the source for all the functions plus
build and install scripts.

This is doctest.

 The Octave-Forge Doctest package finds specially-formatted blocks of
 example code within documentation files. It then executes the code and
 confirms the output is correct. This can be useful as part of a testing
 framework or simply to ensure that documentation stays up-to-date during
 software development.
