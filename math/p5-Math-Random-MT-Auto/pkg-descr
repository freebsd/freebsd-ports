The Mersenne Twister is a fast pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)
that is capable of providing large volumes (> 10^6004) of "high
quality" pseudorandom data to applications that may exhaust available
"truly" random data sources or system-provided PRNGs such as rand.

This module provides PRNGs that are based on the Mersenne Twister.
There is a functional interface to a single, standalone PRNG, and an
OO interface (based on the inside-out object model as implemented by
the Object::InsideOut module) for generating multiple PRNG objects.
The PRNGs are self-seeding, automatically acquiring a (19968-bit)
random seed from user-selectable sources.
