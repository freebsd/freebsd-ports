		REDUCE Codemist Standard Lisp (CSL) version

REDUCE is an interactive system for general algebraic computations of
interest to mathematicians, scientists and engineers.

CSL is a newer Lisp system that continues to evolve and is now written 
completely in C++, which makes it very easy to port to a new machine. 
Like PSL, it is a faithful implementation of Standard Lisp and has been 
optimized for running REDUCE. It requires a very small memory partition 
for its Lisp support. Furthermore, most of the REDUCE facilities are 
supported as machine independent pseudocode, which is quite compact. In 
the worst case, the performance of this system is about a factor of two 
slower than PSL, though in many cases it matches PSL performance. 
However, the memory use is smaller. All CSL versions are distributed with 
sufficient CSL support to run on the given computing system. This is also
an ideal system for those wishing to embed algebraic calculations in a C 
or C++ programming environment. The developer of CSL before it became 
Open Source was Codemist Ltd.
