================================================================================
You installed Lean: The Theorem Prover.

(1) Please note that Lean requires /proc to be mounted.

    The usual way to do this is to add this line to /etc/fstab:
    proc /proc procfs rw 0 0

    and then run this command as root:
    # mount /proc

(2) You might also want to install mathlibtools (math/mathlibtools) in case
    you need to use the mathematical library of Lean.
    mathlibtools download this library to user's home directory for further
    use by Lean.
