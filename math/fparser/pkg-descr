This C++ library offers a class which can be used to parse and evaluate a
mathematical function from a string (which might be eg. requested from the
user). The syntax of the function string is similar to mathematical
expressions written in C/C++ (the exact syntax is specified in the
documentation below). The function can then be evaluated with different values
of variables.
