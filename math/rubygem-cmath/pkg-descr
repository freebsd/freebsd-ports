CMath provides trigonometric and transcendental functions for complex numbers.

CMath is a library that provides trigonometric and transcendental functions for
complex numbers. The functions in this module accept integers, floating-point
numbers or complex numbers as arguments.

Note that the selection of functions is similar, but not identical, to that in
module math. The reason for having two modules is that some users aren't
interested in complex numbers, and perhaps don't even know what they are. They
would rather have Math.sqrt(-1) raise an exception than return a complex number.
