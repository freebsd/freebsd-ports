Methods for spatial data analysis with raster and vector data.
Raster methods allow for low-level data manipulation as well as
high-level global, local, zonal, and focal computation. The predict
and interpolate methods facilitate the use of regression type
(interpolation, machine learning) models for spatial prediction,
including with satellite remote sensing data. Processing of very
large files is supported. See the manual and tutorials on
<https://rspatial.org/terra/> to get started. 'terra' is very similar
to the 'raster' package; but 'terra' can do more, is easier to use,
and it is faster.
