LAPACKE is a standard C language APIs for LAPACK, which introduces
the following features[1]:
- row-major and column-major matrix layout controlled by the first function
  parameter;
- an implementation with working arrays (middle-level interface) as well as
  without working arrays (high-level interface);
- input scalars passed by value;
- error code as a return value instead of the INFO parameter.
