.Sh NAME
.Nm regmath
.Nd "Mathematics libraries for Regina REXX interpreter"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
consists of two separate collections of utility functions for use with the Regina REXX interpreter.
These closely mirror the functions contained in the
.Em RxMath
library provided on IBM systems, and the
.Em RexxMath
library provided for use with Amiga Rexx.
As it stands, the
.Nm
collections will not work with another REXX interpreter.
