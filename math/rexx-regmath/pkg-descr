RxMath duplicates the interface of IBM's RxMath library, as well as the
library that comes with ARexx (known here as RexxMath).

Note that any scripts which load RxMath or RexxMath must be run with the
'regina' command, rather than 'rexx'; the latter does not support the use
of external function packages.
