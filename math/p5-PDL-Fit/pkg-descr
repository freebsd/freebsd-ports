PDL::Fit contains the following packages: PDL::Fit::Gaussian, PDL::Fit::LM,
PDL::Fit::Linfit and PDL::Fit::Polynomial.

PDL::Fit::Gaussian contains some custom gaussian fitting routines. These were
developed in collaboration with Alison Offer, they do a reasonably robust job
and are quite useful.

PDL::Fit::LM provides fitting functions for PDL. Currently, only
Levenberg-Marquardt fitting is implemented. Other procedures should be added as
required. For a fairly concise overview on fitting see Numerical Recipes,
chapter 15 "Modeling of data".

PDL::Fit::Linfit contains routines to perform general curve-fits to a set
(linear combination) of specified functions.

PDL::Fit::Polynomial contains routines for doing simple polynomial fits to data.
