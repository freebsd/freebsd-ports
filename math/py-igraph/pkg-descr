This module extends Python with a Graph class which is capable of handling
arbitrary directed and undirected graphs with thousands of nodes and millions
of edges. Since the module makes use of the open source igraph library
written in almost 100% pure C, it is blazing fast and outperforms most other
pure Python-based packages around.
