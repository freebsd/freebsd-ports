Number::Compare compiles a simple comparison to an anonymous subroutine,
which you can call with a value to be tested again.

Now this would be very pointless, if Number::Compare didn't understand
magnitudes.

The target value may use magnitudes of kilobytes (k, ki), megabytes (m,
mi), or gigabytes (g, gi).  Those suffixed with an i use the appropriate
2**n version in accordance with the IEC standard:
