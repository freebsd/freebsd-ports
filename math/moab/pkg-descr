The Mesh-Oriented datABase (MOAB) is a component for representing and evaluating
mesh data. MOAB can store structured and unstructured mesh, consisting of
elements in the finite element zoo plus polygons and polyhedra. The functional
interface to MOAB is simple yet powerful, allowing the representation of many
types of metadata commonly found on the mesh. MOAB is optimized for efficiency
in space and time, based on access to mesh in chunks rather than through
individual entities, while also versatile enough to support individual entity
access. The MOAB library can naturally represent finite element and other types
of mesh data. Various types of meta-data are often used in conjunction with
a mesh. Examples include boundary condition groupings, material types, and
provenance information for the mesh. Because the data model used in MOAB is so
abstract, conventions are useful for describing how meta-data is stored into
that data model.
