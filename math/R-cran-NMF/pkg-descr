Provides a framework to perform Non-negative Matrix Factorization
(NMF). The package implements a set of already published algorithms
and seeding methods, and provides a framework to test, develop and
plug new/custom algorithms. Most of the built-in algorithms have
been optimized in C++, and the main interface function provides an
easy way of performing parallel computations on multicore machines.
