influenceR: Software Tools to Quantify Structural Importance of
Nodes in a Network

Provides functionality to compute various node centrality measures
on networks. Included are functions to compute betweenness centrality
(by utilizing Madduri and Bader's SNAP library), implementations
of Burt's constraint and effective network size (ENS) metrics,
Borgatti's algorithm to identify key players, and Valente's bridging
metric. On Unix systems, the betweenness, Key Players, and bridging
implementations are parallelized with OpenMP, which may run faster
on systems which have OpenMP configured.
