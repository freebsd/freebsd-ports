Gfan can also be linked to Sage, Singular or Soplex. I refrain to
include those optional dependencies because Sage and Singular support
is not documented in gfan's manual and Soplex has a very restrictive
license (you can use or distribute it only if you are a member of a
noncommercial and academic institution).

If you feel you need any of those optional dependencies, please let
me know and I will do my best to provide it as fast as possible.

The mantainer.
