ABACUS is a software system written in C++ that provides a framework for the
implementation of branch-and-bound algorithms using linear programming
relaxations. Cutting planes or columns can be generated dynamically
(branch-and-cut, branch-and-price, branch-and-cut-and-price).

ABACUS allows the software developer to concentrate merely on the problem
specific parts, i.e., the separation of cutting planes, column generation, and
primal heuristics. ABACUS supports the Open Solver Interface (Osi) developed
by the COIN-OR (COmputational INfrastructure for Operations Research) project
which means that every solver supported by OSI can be used to solve the
relaxations.

Moreover, ABACUS provides a variety of general algorithmic concepts, e.g., a
list of different enumeration and branching strategies from which the best
alternative for the user's application can be chosen.

Finally, ABACUS provides many basic data structures and useful tools for the
implementation of such algorithms. It is designed both for general mixed
integer optimization problems and for combinatorial optimization problems. It
unifies cutting plane and column generation within one algorithm framework.
Simple reuse of code and the design of abstract data structures and algorithms
are met by object oriented programming modules.
