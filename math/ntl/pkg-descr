NTL is an object oriented library for number theory, written
by Victor Shoup.  It provides objects and methods for

	- arbitrary length integers
	- finite fields
	- polynomials over fields
	- extensions of fields.
	- vectors and matrices over extensions
	- finite rings

Unless you define WITHOUT_GMP, NTL requires libgmp4.
