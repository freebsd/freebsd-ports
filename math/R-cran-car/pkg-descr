This package accompanies J. Fox, An R and S-PLUS Companion to Applied
Regression, Sage, 2002. The package contains mostly functions for applied
regression, linear models, and generalized linear models, with an emphasis on
regression diagnostics, particularly graphical diagnostic methods. There are
also some utility functions. With some exceptions, I have tried not to duplicate
capabilities in the basic distribution of R, nor in widely used packages. Where
relevant, the functions in car are consistent with na.action = na.omit or
na.exclude.
