SLEPc is a software library for the solution of large scale sparse eigenvalue
problems on parallel computers. It is an extension of PETSc and can be used for
linear eigenvalue problems in either standard or generalized form, with real or
complex arithmetic. It can also be used for computing a partial SVD of a large,
sparse, rectangular matrix, and to solve nonlinear eigenvalue problems
(polynomial or general). Additionally, SLEPc provides solvers for the
computation of the action of a matrix function on a vector.
