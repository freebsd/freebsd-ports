FrF2: Fractional Factorial Designs with 2-Level Factors

Regular and non-regular Fractional Factorial 2-level designs can be 
created. Furthermore, analysis tools for Fractional Factorial designs 
with 2-level factors are offered (main effects and interaction plots for 
all factors simultaneously, cube plot for looking at the simultaneous 
effects of three factors, full or half normal plot, alias structure in a 
more readable format than with the built-in function alias).
