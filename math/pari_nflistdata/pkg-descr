This is the nflistdata package for PARI/GP, to be used by the 'nflist'
function.

It contains
- tables of A5 number fields, from John JONES and David ROBERTS
  (https://hobbes.la.asu.edu/NFDB/). These are needed for groups
  5T4 = A5 and 6T4 = A5(6).
- tables of regular extensions of Q(t) for most transitive subgroups
  of S_n, n <= 15, by
  * Juergen KLUENERS and Gunter MALLE (see G. Malle and B. H. Matzat,
  Inverse Galois Theory, Springer, 1999).
  * Tim DOKCHITSER
  These are needed by nflist(G, 't) for groups of degree 8 or more
