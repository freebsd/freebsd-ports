Numdiff is a little program that can be used to compare putatively similar files
line by line and field by field, ignoring small numeric differences or/and
different numeric formats. 

Equivalently, Numdiff is a program with the capability to appropriately compare
files containing numerical fields (and not only).

% numdiff file1 file2
