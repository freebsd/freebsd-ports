MathPresso is a C++ library designed to parse mathematical expressions and
compile them into machine code. It's much faster than traditional AST or
byte-code based evaluators, because there is basically no overhead in the
expression's execution. The JIT compiler is based on AsmJit and works on
X86 and X64 architectures.
