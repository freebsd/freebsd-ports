A general implementation of Structural Equation Models with latent
variables (MLE, 2SLS, and composite likelihood estimators) with
both continuous, censored, and ordinal outcomes (Holst and
Budtz-Joergensen (2013) <doi:10.1007/s00180-012-0344-y>). The package
also provides methods for graph exploration (d-separation, back-door
criterion), simulation of general non-linear latent variable models,
and estimation of influence functions for a broad range of statistical
models.
