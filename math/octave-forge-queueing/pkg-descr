The octave-forge package is the result of The GNU Octave Repositry project,
which is intended to be a central location for custom scripts, functions and
extensions for GNU Octave. contains the source for all the functions plus
build and install scripts.

This is queueing.

  The queueing toolbox provides functions for queueing networks and Markov
  chains analysis. This package can be used to compute steady-state performance
  measures for open, closed and mixed networks with single or multiple job
  classes. Mean Valud Analysis (MVA), convolution and various bounding
  techniques are implemented. Various transient and steady-state performance
  measures for Markov chains can als be computed (including state occupancy
  probabilities, mean time to absorption, time-averaged sojourn times), both
  for continuous-time and discrete-time chains.
