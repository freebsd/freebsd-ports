RPy is a very simple, yet robust, Python interface to the R Programming
Language. It can manage all kinds of R objects and can execute arbitrary
R functions (including the graphic functions). All the errors from the
R language are converted to Python exceptions. Any module that later were
installed on the R system, can easily be used from within Python, without
introducing any changes.

rpy2 is a redesign and rewrite of rpy. It is providing a low-level interface
to R, a proposed high-level interface, including wrappers to graphical
libraries, as well as R-like structures and functions.
