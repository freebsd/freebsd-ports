PyMetis is a Python wrapper for the Metis graph partititioning software by
George Karypis, Vipin Kumar and others. It includes version 5.0pre2 of Metis
and wraps it using the Boost Python wrapper generator library. So far, it only
wraps the most basic graph partitioning functionality (which is enough for my
current use), but extending it in case you need more should be quite
straightforward. Using PyMetis to partition your meshes is really easy -
essentially all you need to pass into PyMetis is an adjacency list for the
graph and the number of parts you would like.
