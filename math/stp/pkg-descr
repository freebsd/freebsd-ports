STP is a constraint solver (also referred to as a decision procedure or
automated prover) aimed at solving constraints generated by program analysis
tools, theorem provers, automated bug finders, intelligent fuzzers and model
checkers. STP has been used in many research projects at Stanford, Berkeley,
MIT, CMU and other universities. It is also being used at many companies such
as NVIDIA, some startup companies, and by certain government agencies.

The input to STP are formulas over the theory of bit-vectors and arrays (This
theory captures most expressions from languages like C/C++/Java and Verilog),
and the output of STP is a single bit of information that indicates whether
the formula is satisfiable or not. If the input is satisfiable, then it also
generates a variable assignment to satisfy the input formula.
