PDL::LinearAlgebra provides a convenient interface to PDL::LinearAlgebra::Real
and PDL::LinearAlgebra::Complex. Since Blas and Lapack use a column major
ordering scheme some routines here need to transpose matrices before calling
fortran routines and transpose back (see the documentation of each routine). If
you need optimized code use directly PDL::LinearAlgebra::Real and
PDL::LinearAlgebra::Complex.
