Modin is a drop-in replacement for pandas. While pandas is single-threaded,
Modin lets you instantly speed up your workflows by scaling pandas so it uses
all of your cores. Modin works especially well on larger datasets, where pandas
becomes painfully slow or runs out of memory. Also, Modin comes with the
additional APIs to improve user experience.
