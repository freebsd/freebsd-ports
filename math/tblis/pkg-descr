TBLIS is a library and framework for performing tensor operations,
especially tensor contraction, using native algorithms. In this
context, native means that TBLIS does not translate tensor
operations into matrix operations using the BLAS libraries.
Instead, TBLIS uses the philosophy (and certain low-level kernels)
of the BLIS framework to implement tensor contraction with
essentially zero overhead compared to matrix multiplication. TBLIS
also aims to offer a convenient C++ interface for tensors and
tensor operations, as well as a stable C interface with high
portability.
