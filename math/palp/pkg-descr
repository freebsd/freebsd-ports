A Package for Analyzing Lattice Polytopes (PALP) is a set of C programs for
calculations with lattice polytopes and applications to toric geometry.

It contains routines for vertex and facet enumeration, computation of incidences
and symmetries, as well as completion of the set of lattice points in the convex
hull of a given set of points. In addition, there are procedures specialised to
reflexive polytopes such as the enumeration of reflexive subpolytopes, and
applications to toric geometry and string theory, like the computation of Hodge
data and fibration structures for toric Calabi-Yau varieties.  The package is
well tested and optimised in speed as it was used for time consuming tasks such
as the classification of reflexive polyhedra in 4 dimensions and the creation
and manipulation of very large lists of 5-dimensional polyhedra.

While originally intended for low-dimensional applications, the algorithms work
in any dimension and our key routine for vertex and facet enumeration compares
well with existing packages.
