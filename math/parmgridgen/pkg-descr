ParMGridGen-1.0 is a highly optimized serial and parallel library
for obtaining a sequence of successive coarse grids that are well suited
for geometric multigrid methods.
The quality of the elements of the coarse grids is optimized using a
multilevel framework.
The parallel library is based on MPI and is portable to
a wide range of architectures.
