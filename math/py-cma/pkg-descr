pycma is a Python implementation of CMA-ES and a few related numerical
optimization tools.

The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is a stochastic
derivative-free numerical optimization algorithm for difficult (non-convex,
ill-conditioned, multi-modal, rugged, noisy) optimization problems in continuous
search spaces.
