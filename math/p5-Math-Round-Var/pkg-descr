This module gives you the ability to round numbers to either decimal or
fractional precision while encapsulating the rounding precision in an
object. This allows scripts and modules to maintain multiple precision
values as objects.

It also implements flexible scheme parsing, so that your programs and
modules can offload the how-to-round decisions to this module.
