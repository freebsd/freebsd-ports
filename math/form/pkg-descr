FORM is a Symbolic Manipulation System. It reads symbolic expressions from files
and executes symbolic/algebraic transformations upon them. The answers are
returned in a textual mathematical representation. As its landmark feature, the
size of the considered expressions in FORM is only limited by the available disk
space and not by the available RAM.
