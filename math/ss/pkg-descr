SS is a spreadsheet program.  It is based upon the well known(?) public 
domain spreadsheet program sc 6.19.
This is an ASCII spreadsheet program.  This is not Lotus 1-2-3.  It is 
not Microsoft Excel. It does not do graphs or charts.  It does not do 
drawings.  It does not use a mouse.
It _does_ do a fine job of manipulating rows and columns of numbers. Want 
a simple way of managing your students' grades, calculating class 
averages, etc?  No problem.  Want to figure out how much money you can 
borrow from the bank for a mortgage?  We can do that.
