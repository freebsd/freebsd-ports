Bitwuzla is a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver for the theories of
fixed-size bit-vectors, floating-point arithmetic, arrays and uninterpreted
functions and their combinations. Its name is derived from an Austrian dialect
expression that can be translated as "someone who tinkers with bits".
