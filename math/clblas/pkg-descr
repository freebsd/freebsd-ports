clBLAS

a software library containing BLAS functions written in OpenCL 

The primary goal of clBLAS is to make it easier for developers to utilize the
inherent performance and power efficiency benefits of heterogeneous computing.
clBLAS interfaces do not hide nor wrap OpenCL interfaces, but rather leaves
OpenCL state management to the control of the user to allow for maximum
performance and flexibility. The clBLAS library does generate and enqueue
optimized OpenCL kernels, relieving the user from the task of writing,
optimizing and maintaining kernel code themselves.
