PDL ("Perl Data Language") gives standard Perl the ability to compactly store
and speedily manipulate the large N-dimensional data arrays which are the bread
and butter of scientific computing.

PDL turns Perl into a free, array-oriented, numerical language similar to (but,
we believe, better than) such commercial packages as IDL and MatLab. One can
write simple perl expressions to manipulate entire numerical arrays all at once.
Simple interactive shells, pdl2 and perldl, are provided for use from the
command line along with the PDL module for use in Perl scripts.
