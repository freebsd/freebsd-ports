This port installs the module GraphBLAS of SuiteSparse.

SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is a complete implementation of the GraphBLAS
standard, which defines a set of sparse matrix operations on an extended
algebra of semirings using an almost unlimited variety of operators and
types. When applied to sparse adjacency matrices, these algebraic
operations are equivalent to computations on graphs. GraphBLAS provides
a powerful and expressive framework for creating graph algorithms based
on the elegant mathematics of sparse matrix operations on a semiring.
