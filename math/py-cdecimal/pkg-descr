The cdecimal is a fast drop-in replacement for the decimal module in Python's
standard library. Both modules provide complete implementations of the General
Decimal Arithmetic Specification.

Typical performance gains are between 30x for I/O heavy benchmarks and 80x for
numerical programs. In a database benchmark, cdecimal exhibits a speedup of
12x over decimal.py.

 	decimal	cdecimal speedup
pi	42.75s	0.58s	 74x
telco	172.19s	5.68s	 30x
psycopg	3.57s	0.29s	 12x

All Python versions from 2.5 up to 3.2 are supported. For the few remaining
differences, read the cdecimal documentation. cdecimal has been included in
Python-3.3.
