Software for Flexible Bayesian Modeling and Markov Chain Sampling

This software supports Bayesian regression and classification models
based on neural networks and Gaussian processes, and Bayesian mixture
models.  It also supports a variety of Markov chain sampling methods,
which may be applied to distributions specified by simple formulas,
including simple Bayesian models defined by formulas for the prior
and likelihood.

Before trying to use the software, you may need to read various 
references that describe the models and the Markov chain methods used.

Some of the programs in this package are designed for use with the xgraph 
plot package for X-Windows, though the data can instead be plotted by 
whatever plot program you have available.
