The AI::DecisionTree module automatically creates so-called "decision trees"
to explain a set of training data. A decision tree is a kind of categorizer
that use a flowchart-like process for categorizing new instances.

A decision tree like this one can be learned from training data, and
then applied to previously unseen data to obtain results that are consistent
with the training data.
