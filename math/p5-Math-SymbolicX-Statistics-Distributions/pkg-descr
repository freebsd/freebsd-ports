This module offers easy access to formulas for a few often-used
distributions. For that, it uses the Math::Symbolic module which gives the
user an opportunity to manufacture distributions to his liking.

The module can be used in two styles: It has a procedural interface which
is demonstrated in the first half of the synopsis. But it also features a
wholly different interface: It can modify the Math::Symbolic parser so
that you can use the distributions right inside strings that will be
parsed as Math::Symbolic trees. This is demonstrated for very simple cases
in the second half of the synopsis.

All arguments in both interface styles are optional. Whichever expression
is used instead of, for examle 'mean', is plugged into the formula for the
distribution as a Math::Symbolic tree. Details on argument handling are
explained below.

Please see the section on Export for details on how to choose the
interface style you want to use.
