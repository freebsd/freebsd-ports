Algorithms for accelerating the convergence of slow, monotone
sequences from smooth, contraction mapping such as the EM algorithm.
It can be used to accelerate any smooth, linearly convergent
acceleration scheme. A tutorial style introduction to this package
is available in a vignette on the CRAN download page or, when the
package is loaded in an R session, with vignette("SQUAREM").
