CRlibm is an efficient and proven mathematical library, which
provides implementations of the double-precision C99 standard
elementary functions, correctly rounded in the four IEEE-754 rounding
modes, and sufficiently efficient in average time, worst-case time,
and memory consumption to replace existing libms transparently.

The distribution includes extensive documentation with the proof
of each function (currently more than 100 pages), as well as all
the Maple scripts used to develop the functions. This makes this
library an excellent tutorial on software elementary function
development.

CRlibm also includes a lightweight library for multiple precision,
scslib (Software Carry Save Library). This library has been developed
specifically to answer the needs of the CRlibm project: precision
up to a few hundred bits, portability, compatibility with IEEE
floating-point standards, performance comparable to or better than
GMP, and a small footprint. It uses a data-structure which allows
carry propagations to be avoided during multiple-precision
multiplications, and supports addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and conversions.
