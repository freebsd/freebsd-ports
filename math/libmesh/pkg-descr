The libMesh library provides a framework for the numerical simulation of partial
differential equations using arbitrary unstructured discretizations on serial
and parallel platforms. A major goal of the library is to provide support for
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) computations in parallel while allowing a
research scientist to focus on the physics they are modeling.

libMesh is based on this publication:
