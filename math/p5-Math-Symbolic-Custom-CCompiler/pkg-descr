This module extends the functionality of Math::Symbolic by offering
facilities to compile symbolic math trees (formulas) to C code. It also
uses Inline::C to compile and link the generated C code at run-time, thus
allowing the user to do symbolic calculations in Perl with Math::Symbolic
and then use the results in a fast numeric environment.

This software generates code. Code generators are difficult to test, but
the first release of the module is now 1.5 years old and I haven't
received any bug reports, so I consider it somewhat stable now.

Please read the manpage of Math::Symbolic::Compiler which comes with the
Math::Symbolic distribution. Most of the gotchas involved with compiling
the functions to Perl subroutines also apply to this module which compiles
to C instead.

Alternatively, you can use the module not for faster calculations from
your Perl program, but to generate C code for you. I have used it to
generate an implementation for (many!) Zernike Polynomials for work in C.
