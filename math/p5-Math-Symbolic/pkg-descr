Math::Symbolic is intended to offer symbolic calculation capabilities to
the Perl programmer without using external (and commercial) libraries
and/or applications.

Possibly the most convenient way of constructing Math::Symbolic trees is
using the builtin parser to generate trees from expressions such as '2 *
x^5'. You may use the Math::Symbolic->parse_from_string() class method for
this.
