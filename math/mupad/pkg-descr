Mupad is a sophisticated computer algebra system,
an alternation for Mathematica and Maple.
Mupad can handle not only algebraic calculation like integration, 
differentiate and matrix manipulation,
but also numerical calculations, and draw a beautiful graphs.
We can obtain free(!) single-user licenses for non-commercial
educational and research use.
