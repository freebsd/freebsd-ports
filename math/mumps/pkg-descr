MUMPS is a Distributed Multifrontal Solver (F90, MPI based) with Dynamic
Distributed Scheduling to accomodate both numerical fill-in and multi-user
environment.

- Solution of large linear systems with symmetric positive definite
matrices; general symmetric matrices; general unsymmetric matrices.
- Version for complex arithmetic.
- Parallel factorization and solve phases (uniprocessor version also
available).
- Iterative refinement and backward error analysis.
- Various matrix input formats: assembled format; distributed assembled
format; elemental format.
- Partial factorization and Schur complement matrix.
- Several orderings interfaced : AMD, AMF, PORD, METIS
