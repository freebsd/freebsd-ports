This software framework implements a NURBS-based Galerkin finite element method
(FEM), popularly known as isogeometric analysis (IGA). It is heavily based on
PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation. PETSc is a
collection of algorithms and data structures for the solution of scientific
problems, particularly those modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs).
PETSc is written to be applicable to a range of problem sizes, including
large-scale simulations where high performance parallel is a must. PetIGA can
be thought of as an extension of PETSc, which adds the NURBS discretization
capability and the integration of forms. The PetIGA framework is intended for
researchers in the numeric solution of PDEs who have applications which require
extensive computational resources.
