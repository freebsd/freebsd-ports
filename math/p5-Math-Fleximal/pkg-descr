This is a package for doing integer arithmetic while using a different
base representation than normal. In base n arithmetic you have n
symbols which have a representation. I was going to call them
"glyphs", but being text strings they are not really. On Tye McQueen's
whimsical suggestion I settled on the name Math::Fleximal, the set of
text representations is called a "flex", and the representation of
individual digits are the "flecks". These names are somewhat
unofficial...

This allows you to do basic arithmetic using whatever digits you want,
and to convert from one to another.
