The uncertainties package is a free, cross-platform program that transparently
handles calculations with numbers with uncertainties (like 3.14+/-0.01). It can
also yield the derivatives of any expression.

The uncertainties package takes the pain and complexity out of uncertainty
calculations. Error propagation is not to be feared anymore!

Calculations of results with uncertainties, or of derivatives, can be performed
either in an interactive session (as with a calculator), or in programs written
in the Python programming language. Existing calculation code can run with
little or no change.

Whatever the complexity of a calculation, this package returns its result with
an uncertainty as predicted by linear error propagation theory. It automatically
calculates derivatives and uses them for calculating uncertainties. Almost all
uncertainty calculations are performed analytically.

Correlations between variables are automatically handled, which sets this module
a part from many existing error propagation codes.
