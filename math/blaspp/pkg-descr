The objective of BLAS++ is to provide a convenient, performance
oriented API for development in the C++ language, that, for the most
part, preserves established conventions, while, at the same time,
takes advantages of modern C++ features, such as: namespaces,
templates, exceptions, etc.

BLAS++ is part of the SLATE project (Software for Linear Algebra
Targeting Exascale), which is funded by the Department of Energy as
part of its Exascale Computing Initiative (ECP). Closely related to
BLAS++ is the LAPACK++ project, which provides a C++ API for LAPACK.
