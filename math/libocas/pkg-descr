libocas implements an Optimized Cutting Plane Algorithm (OCAS) for training
linear SVM classifiers from large-scale data. The computational effort of
OCAS scales with O(m log m) where m is the sample size. In an extensive
empirical evaluation, OCAS significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
SVM solvers.

libocas also implements the COFFIN framework for efficient training of
translation invariant image classifiers from virtual examples.
