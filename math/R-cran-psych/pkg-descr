R-psych provides a number of routines for personality, psychometrics and
experimental psychology. Functions are primarily for scale construction using
factor analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although others
provide basic descriptive statistics. Functions for simulating particular item
and test structures are included. Several functions serve as a useful front end
for structural equation modeling. Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor
analysis and structural equation models are created using basic graphics. Some
of the functions are written to support a book on psychometrics as well as
publications in personality research.
