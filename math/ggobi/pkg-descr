GGobi is an open source visualization program for exploring high-dimensional
data. It provides highly dynamic and interactive graphics such as tours, as
well as familiar graphics such as the scatterplot, barchart and parallel
coordinates plots. Plots are interactive and linked with brushing and
identification.
