PDL::IO::IDL allows you to read and write IDL(tm) data files.

Currently, only reading is implemented. Scalars, arrays, and structures are all
supported. Heap pointers, compiled code, and objects are not supported. Of those
three, only heap pointers are likely to be supported in the future.

This code was not developed by RSI, makers of IDL.
