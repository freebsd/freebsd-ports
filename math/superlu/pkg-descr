			SuperLU (Version 2.0)
			=====================

SuperLU contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear system
A*X=B. It uses Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP).
The columns of A may be preordered before factorization; the
preordering for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization.

SuperLU is implemented in ANSI C, and must be compiled with standard
ANSI C compilers. It provides functionality for both real and complex
matrices, in both single and double precision. The file names for the
single-precision real version start with letter "s" (such as sgstrf.c);
the file names for the double-precision real version start with letter "d"
(such as dgstrf.c); the file names for the single-precision complex
version start with letter "c" (such as cgstrf.c); the file names
for the double-precision complex version start with letter "z"
(such as zgstrf.c).
