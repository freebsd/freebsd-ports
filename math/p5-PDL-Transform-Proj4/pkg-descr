PDL::Transform::Proj4 works like PDL::Transform::Cartography, but using the proj
library in the background.

The main object here is the PDL::Transform::Proj4 object, aliased to the
t_proj() function.

This object accepts all of the standard options described below, but mainly is
there to be called with just the proj_params option defined.

When options are used, they must be used with a '+' before them when placed in
the proj_params string, but that is not required otherwise. See the SYNOPSIS
above.

Please note that unlike PROJ, all angles in these operations are in degrees.
This is correctly (as of PDL 2.094) reflected in the PDL::Transform subclass
objects.

Other than t_proj(), all of the other transforms below have been autogenerated,
and may not work properly. The main problem is determining the parameters a
projection requires from the proj library itself.

Due to the difficulties in doing this, there may be times when the proj docs
specify a parameter for a projection that won't work using the anon-hash type
specification. In that case, just throw that parameter in the proj_params
string, and everything should work fine.
