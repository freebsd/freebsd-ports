PDAL is a BSD licensed library for translating and manipulating
point cloud data of various formats. It is a library that is
analogous to the GDAL raster library. PDAL is focussed on reading,
writing, and translating point cloud data from the ever-growing
constellation of data formats that are being developed for working
with multi-dimensional emitted-pulse scanning systems. While PDAL is
 not explicitly limited to working with LiDAR data formats, its
initial rollout is focused in that area.
