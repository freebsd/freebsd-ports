The module provides a method to calculate geographic distances
between coordinates in geodetic WGS84 format using the Haversine
formula.

It is similar to GIS::Distance, but without the extra bells and
whistles and without the additional dependencies. Same great taste,
less filling. It exists for those who cannot, or prefer not to
install Moose and its dependencies.
