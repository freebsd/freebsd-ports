On 11.1 and later, there is a problem downloading R packages when
R is built with gfortran.

Use either of these workarounds until a permanent solution is found.

1. If you are on an amd64 system, use flang to build R.  R is now built
   by default using flang on amd64.

2. If you use gfortran to build R, add

   options(download.file.method="wget")

   to ~/.Rprofile followed by a newline.
