Frobby is a software system and project for computations with monomial
ideals. Frobby is free software and it is intended as a vehicle for
computational and mathematical research on monomial ideals.

The current functionality includes Euler characteristic, Hilbert
series, maximal standard monomials, combinatorial optimization on
monomial ideals, primary decomposition, irreducible decomposition,
Alexander dual, associated primes, minimization and intersection of
monomial ideals as well as the computation of Frobenius problems
(using 4ti2) with very large numbers. Frobby is also able to translate
between formats that can be used with several different computer
systems, such as Macaulay 2, Monos, 4ti2, CoCoA4 and Singular. Thus
Frobby can be used with any of those systems.
