This module provides basic functions used in descriptive statistics. It
borrows very heavily from Statistics::Descriptive::Full (which is included
with Statistics::Descriptive) with one major difference. This module is
optimized for discretized data e.g. data from an A/D conversion that has a
discrete set of possible values. E.g. if your data is produced by an 8 bit
A/D then you'd have only 256 possible values in your data set. Even though
you might have a million data points, you'd only have 256 different values
in those million points. Instead of storing the entire data set as
Statistics::Descriptive does, this module only stores the values it's seen
and the number of times it's seen each value.

For very large data sets, this storage method results in significant speed
and memory improvements. In a test case with 2.6 million data points from
a real world application, Statistics::Descriptive::Discrete took 40
seconds to calculate a set of statistics instead of the 561 seconds
required by Statistics::Descriptive::Full. It also required only 4MB of
RAM instead of the 400MB used by Statistics::Descriptive::Full for the
same data set.
