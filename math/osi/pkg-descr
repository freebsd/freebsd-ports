Osi (Open Solver Interface) provides an abstract base class to a generic linear
programming (LP) solver, along with derived classes for specific solvers. Many
applications may be able to use the Osi to insulate themselves from a specific
LP solver. The following is a list of derived Osi classes:

Solver        Derived Class
* Cbc         OsiCbc
* Clp         OsiClp
* CPLEX       OsiCpx
* DyLP        OsiDylp
* GLPK        OsiGlpk
* Gurobi      OsiGrb
* MOSEK       OsiMsk
* SoPlex      OsiSpx
* SYMPHONY    OsiSym
* Vol         OsiVol
* XPRESS-MP   OsiXpr
