Gnuplot.py is a Python package that interfaces to gnuplot, the popular plotting
program. It allows you to use gnuplot from within Python to plot arrays of data
from memory, data files, or mathematical functions. If you use Python to
perform computations or as `glue' for numerical programs, you can use this
package to plot data on the fly as they are computed. And the combination with
Python makes it is easy to automate things, including to create crude
`animations' by plotting different datasets one after another.

Commands are communicated to gnuplot through a pipe and data either through
the same pipe (as "inline" data) or through temporary files. It has been
written and tested on a Unix computer.

This package has an object-oriented design that allows the user flexibility to
set plot options and to run multiple gnuplot sessions simultaneously. If you
are more ambitious, it is not difficult to add entirely new types of plottable
items by deriving from the `PlotItem' class.

For a demonstration, run the python file by typing `python demo.py'.
