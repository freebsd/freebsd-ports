The octave-forge package is the result of The GNU Octave Repositry project,
which is intended to be a central location for custom scripts, functions and
extensions for GNU Octave. contains the source for all the functions plus
build and install scripts.

This is nlwing2.

This package allows efficient computation of nonlinear aerodynamic properties
of a wing. It employs 2D section data to build a 3D potential vortex model of
the flow. It uses a robust Euler-Newton method to track the change of flow
vorticity quantities as the angle of attack progresses.
