The Unified Form Language (UFL) is a domain specific language for
declaration of finite element discretizations of variational forms.
More precisely, it defines a flexible interface for choosing finite
element spaces and defining expressions for weak forms in a notation
close to mathematical notation.

UFL is part of the FEniCS Project.
