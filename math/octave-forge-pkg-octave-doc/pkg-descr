which is intended to be a central location for custom scripts, functions and
extensions for GNU Octave. contains the source for all the functions plus
build and install scripts.

 This package provides functions for generating HTML pages that
contain the help texts of the functions of an octave package. The package is
designed to work with installed packages and use their INDEX file for creating
the respective functions' HTML pages. The default layout is based on boootstrap
5 and it follows the design of the Octave Packages GitHub page.
