METIS is a set of programs for partitioning graphs and for producing fill
reducing orderings for sparse matrices. The algorithms implemented by METIS
are based on the multilevel graph partitioning scheme described in [KK95a]
and [KK95e].

METIS provides high quality partitions, is extremely fast, and produces
low fill orderings.
