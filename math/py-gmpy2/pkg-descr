C-coded Python extension module that supports multiple-precision arithmetic.
In addition to supporting GMP or MPIR for multiple-precision integer and
rational arithmetic, gmpy2 adds support for the MPFR (correctly rounded real
floating-point arithmetic) and MPC (correctly rounded complex floating-point
arithmetic) libraries.
