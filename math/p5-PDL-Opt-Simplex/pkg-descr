PDL::Opt::Simplex implements the commonly used simplex optimization algorithm.
The basic idea of the algorithm is to move a "simplex" of N+1 points in the
N-dimensional search space according to certain rules. The main benefit of the
algorithm is that you do not need to calculate the derivatives of your function.
