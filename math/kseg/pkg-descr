KSEG is a Free (GPL) interactive geometry program for exploring Euclidean
geometry. It runs on Unix-based platforms (according to users, it also compiles
and runs on Mac OS X and should run on anything that Qt supports). You create a
construction, such as a triangle with a circumcenter, and then, as you drag
verteces of the triangle, you can see the circumcenter moving in real time. Of
course, you can do a lot more than that.

KSEG can be used in the classroom, for personal exploration of geometry, or for
making high-quality figures for LaTeX. It is very fast, stable, and the UI has
been designed for efficiency and consistency. I can usually make a construction
in KSEG in less than half the time it takes me to do it with similar programs.
Despite the name, it is Qt based and does not require KDE to run.

KSEG was inspired by the Geometer's Sketchpad, but it goes beyond the
functionality that Sketchpad provides.
