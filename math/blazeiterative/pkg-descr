A set of iterative linear system solvers intended for use with the Blaze
library, a high-performance C++ linear algebra library. The API is currently
based on a tag-dispatch system to choose a particular algorithm.

Currently implemented algorithms:
* Conjugate Gradient (CG)
* BiCGSTAB

Planned algorithms:
* Preconditioned CG
* Preconditioned BiCGSTAB
* (Preconditioned) BiCGSTAB(l)
* GMRES
* Arnoldi
* Lanczos

Potential algorithms (if sufficient interest):
* LSQR
* LSMR
