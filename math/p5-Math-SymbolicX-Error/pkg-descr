This module adds numeric error (or uncertainty) support to the
Math::Symbolic parser. It does so by extending the parser grammar of the
Math::Symbolic module (that is, the one stored in $Math::Symbolic::Parser)
with certain special functions that create constants as Number::WithError
objects. (Math::Symbolic::Variable objects have been able to contain
objects since the very beginning.)
