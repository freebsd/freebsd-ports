   SPOOLES is a library for solving sparse real and complex linear
   systems of equations, written in the C language using object oriented
   design. At present, there is the following functionality:
    1. Compute multiple minimum degree, generalized nested dissection and
       multisection orderings of matrices with symmetric structure.
    2. Factor and solve square linear systems of equations with symmetric
       structure, with or without pivoting for stability. The
       factorization can be symmetric LDLT, Hermitian LDLH, or
       nonsymmetric LDU. A direct factorization or a drop tolerance
       factorization can be computed. The factors and solve can be done
       in serial mode, multithreaded with Solaris or POSIX threads, or
       with MPI.
    3. Factor and solve overdetermined full rank systems of equations
       using a multifrontal QR factorization, in serial or using POSIX
       threads.
    4. Solve square linear systems using a variety of Krylov iterative
       methods. The preconditioner is a drop tolerance factorization,
       with or without pivoting for stability.
