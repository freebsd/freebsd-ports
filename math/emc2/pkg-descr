Emc2 is a portable, interactive and graphic software Edition of two
dimensional geometry and mesh. We can create and modify the geometry
(CAD), define the discretization on the lines, define the subdomains,
and define some reference numbers to take into account the boundary
conditions and material properties. The elements of the mesh are triangles
and quadrilaterals. We have two kind of meshes: grid mesh and Delaunay
Voronoo (automatic mesh). We make the edition of the mesh by moving,
removing, adding vertices, by regularization, or by transformations
(symmetry, rotation,..), etc.

Suggested add-on: the port math/bamg.
