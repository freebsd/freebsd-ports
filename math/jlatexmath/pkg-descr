The goal of this Java API is to display mathematical formulas written in
LaTeX. The default encoding is UTF-8.

The most of LaTeX commands are available and :

 1) macros from amsmath and symbols from amssymb and stmaryrd;
 2) \includegraphics (without options);
 3) the TeX macro \over;
 4) accents from amsxtra package;
 5) the macros \definecolor, \textcolor, \colorbox and \fcolorbox from the
    package color;
 6) the macros \rotatebox, \reflectbox and \scalebox from the package graphicx;
 7) the most of latin unicode characters are available and cyrillic or
    greek characters are detected for the loading of the different fonts;
 8) the commands \newcommand and \newenvironment;
 9) the environments array, matrix, pmatrix,..., eqnarray, cases;
10) the fonts are embedded in the jar file to be used by fop 0.95 to generate
    PDF, PS or EPS (SVG export with shaped fonts works fine too);
11) and probably other things I forgot...
