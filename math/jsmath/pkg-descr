The jsMath package provides a method of including mathematics in HTML pages
that works across multiple browsers under Windows, Macintosh OS X, Linux and
other flavors of unix. jsMath uses native fonts, so they resize when you
change the size of the text in your browser, they print at the full resolution
of your printer, and you don't have to wait for dozens of images to be
downloaded in order to see the mathematics in a web page. There are also
advantages for web-page authors, as there is no need to preprocess your
web pages to generate any images, and the mathematics is entered in TeX form,
so it is easy to create and maintain your web pages.

Although it works best with the TeX fonts installed, jsMath will fall back
on a collection of image-based fonts (which can still be scaled or printed
at high resolution) or unicode fonts when the TeX fonts are not available.
