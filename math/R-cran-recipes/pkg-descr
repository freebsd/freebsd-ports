An extensible framework to create and preprocess design matrices.
Recipes consist of one or more data manipulation and analysis
"steps". Statistical parameters for the steps can be estimated from
an initial data set and then applied to other data sets. The resulting
design matrices can then be used as inputs into statistical or
machine learning models.
