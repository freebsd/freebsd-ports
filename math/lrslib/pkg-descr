lrslib is a self-contained ANSI C implementation of the reverse search algorithm
for  vertex enumeration/convex hull problems and comes with a choice of three
arithmetic packages. Input file formats are compatible with Komei Fukuda's cdd
package. All computations are done exactly in either multiple  precision or
fixed integer arithmetic. Output is not stored in memory, so even problems with
very large output sizes can sometimes be solved. The program is intended for
Unix/Linux platforms, but will compile using gcc/cygwin on Windows.
