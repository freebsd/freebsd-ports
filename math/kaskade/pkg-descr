The KASKADE software package solves linear scalar elliptic and 
parabolic problems in 1, 2, 3 space dimensions with adaptive finite
element methods.

Furthermore, the toolbox includes extensions for handling systems of
equations and example algorithms for nonlinear methods used in obstacle,
porous media or Stefan problems.

The core of the program is a variety of multilevel/multigrid
preconditioners for the arising linear systems.

The code, a programmer's manual describing the software design, and a
user's guide are available by anonymous ftp from the MGNet or from the
eLib at the Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum in Berlin.
