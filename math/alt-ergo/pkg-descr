Alt-Ergo is an automatic theorem prover dedicated to program verification.
Alt-Ergo is based on CC(X), a congruence closure algorithm parameterized by
an equational theory X. Currently, CC(X) can be instantiated by the empty
equational theory and by the linear arithmetics. Alt-Ergo contains also a
home made SAT-solver and an instantiation mechanism.

Alt-Ergo is compact, safe, and modular. Each component is described by a small
set of inference rules and is implemented as an Ocaml functor.
