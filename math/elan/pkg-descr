elan is a small tool for managing your installations of the Lean theorem prover.
It places `lean` and `lake` binaries in your `PATH` that automatically select
and, if necessary, download the Lean version described in your project's
lean-toolchain file.

You can also install, select, run, and uninstall Lean versions manually using
the commands of the `elan` executable.
