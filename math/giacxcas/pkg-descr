General purpose computer algebra system by Bernard Parisse released under
GPLv3.  French documentation by Renee De Graeve is for non-commercial use
only.  The package consists of:

 - a C++ library (libgiac).  It is build on C and C++ libraries:
   PARI, NTL (arithmetic), CoCoA (Groebner basis), GSL (numerics),
   GMP (big integers), MPFR (bigfloats) and provides algorithms for
   basic polynomial operations (product, GCD) and symbolic
   computations (simplifications, limits/series, symbolic
   integration, summation, ...). The library can be configured to
   accept Maple or TI syntax to ease the transition for users of
   these systems.
 - a command line interpreter (icas or giac). It can be called from texmacs.
 - a FLTK-based GUI (xcas). It is a GUI for symbolic computation
   with several modules added: 2-d and 3-d graphics, dynamic 2-d and
   3-d geometry (exact or numeric), spreadsheet, programming
   environment.

Bernard Parisse is the main author of the CAS of HP40G and HP49G calculators.
