The octave-forge package is the result of The GNU Octave Repository project,
which is intended to be a central location for custom scripts, functions and
extensions for GNU Octave. contains the source for all the functions plus
build and install scripts.

This baseport provides the basic directory structure, and installs a script
"load-octave-pkg", that synchronizes the FreeBSD ports structure to the octave
packaging system.

Another purpose of the script "load-octave-pkg" is to attempt to correct any
errors created by the octave packaging system.
