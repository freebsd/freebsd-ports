qpOASES is an open-source C++ implementation of the recently proposed online
active set strategy for solving quadratic programming (QP) problems. It has
several theoretical features that make it particularly suited for model
predictive control (MPC) applications. Further numerical modifications have
made qpOASES a reliable QP solver, even when tackling semi-definite, ill-posed
or degenerated QP problems. Moreover, several interfaces to third-party software
make qpOASES easy-to-use even for users without knowledge of C/C++.
