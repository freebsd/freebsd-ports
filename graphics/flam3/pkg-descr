Fractal Flames are algorithmically generated images
and animations.  The shape of each image is specified
by a long string of numbers - a genetic code of sorts.

You can create your own flames with the Apophysis
interactive designer (for windows), Qosmic (for Linux),
or Oxidizer (for Mac OS X), or Apophysis-J (cross-
platform in Java).

Or you can use the Electric Sheep distributed screen
saver to join the collective evolution of animated
fractal flames.
