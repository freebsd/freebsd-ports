exiftran is a command line utility to transform digital image jpeg images.

It can do lossless rotations like jpegtran, but unlike jpegtran it cares
about the EXIF data: It can rotate images automatically by checking the exif
orientation tag, it updates the exif informaton if needed (image dimension,
orientation), it also rotates the exif thumbnail.
It can process multiple images at once.
