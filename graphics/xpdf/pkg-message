Please note: The binaries in this package -- pdffonts, pdfimages, pdfinfo,
pdfdetach, pdftohtml, pdftopng, pdftoppm, pdftops, pdftotext -- are
installed in ${LOCALBASE}/libexec/xpdf. The reason for this is to not
conflict with the poppler-utils package, which is a prerequisite of many
other packages. If you need to use any of these utilites,

a) create symlinks in ${LOCALBASE}/bin or some other directory in $PATH, or
b) install graphics/poppler-utils.
