Under Linux there aren't many freely available vector graphics editors and
as far as I know there are none that can edit EPS (encapsulated postscript)
and PDF (portable document format) files. I produce lots of these files in
my day-to-day work and I would like to be able to edit them. The best vector
graphics editor I have found so far is Inkscape but it only reads SVG
files... (Note: the upcoming v0.46 should be able to read PDFs!)

To overcome this problem I have written a very small utility to convert PDF
files to SVG files using Poppler and Cairo. Version 0.2.1 is available here
(with modifications by Matthew Flaschen and Ed Grace). This appears to work
on any PDF document that Poppler can read (try them in XPDF or Evince since
they both use Poppler).

So now it is possible to easily edit PDF documents with your favourite SVG
editor! One other alternative would be to use pstoedit but the commercial
SVG module costs (unsurprisingly!) and the free SVG module is not very good
at handling text...
