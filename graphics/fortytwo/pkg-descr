FT is a generic, native graph management system for GNUstep and Cocoa and
is written in Objective-C. With FT you can persistently manage graphs
consisting of nodes and edges. Each node may provide so-called services.
Such a service may be e.g. a dictionary services, which all nodes provide
at present. This service allows the storage of any data in a node and is
based on keys which uniquely identify content within a dictionary.
