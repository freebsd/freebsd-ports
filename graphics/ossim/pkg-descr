OSSIM is an open source, C++ (mostly), geospatial image processing library used
by government, commercial, educational, and private entities throughout the
solar system. It has been in active development since the last millenium. This
repository contains the full OSSIM package including core library, applications,
tests, and build system. It does not contain the OSSIM plugins and other
OSSIM-related code such as java-bindings (ossim-oms), and GUI. Those are
available for individually cloning. Refer to the root github page for ossimlabs.
