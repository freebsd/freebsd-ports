The ffmpeg-php is an extension for PHP that adds an easy to use, 
object-oriented API for accessing and retrieving information from video and 
audio files. It has methods for returning frames from movie files as images 
that can be manipulated using PHP's image functions. This works well for 
automatically creating thumbnail images from movies. ffmpeg-php is also useful 
for reporting the duration and bitrate of audio files (mp3, wma...). 

The ffmpeg-php can access many of the video formats supported by ffmpeg (mov, 
avi, mpg, wmv...)
