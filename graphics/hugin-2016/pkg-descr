A GUI for Panorama Tools, to stitch panoramic images.

With hugin you can assemble a mosaic of photographs into a complete
immersive panorama, stitch any series of overlapping pictures and much
more.

The standard port for hugin is graphics/hugin.  This version is the
release candidate (RC1) for the 2016.0.0 version.  When it is
released, the graphics/hugin port will be updated to install it, and
this version will go away.

If you run into problems with this version, please report them on the
