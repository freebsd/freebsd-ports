Gimmage is a simple image viewer that aims to have a minimalist
interface and tries to be keyboard operable for browsing through a
large number of images quickly. It is appropriate for command line
usage as it accepts directories and image filenames as arguments. It
has an in-application file browser that allows users to select and
drag images and directories into the image viewing area in order to
have them displayed.
