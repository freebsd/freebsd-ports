A glue layer between clutter and box2d that provides a special group where the
actors can be set to be static or dynamic in regard to a physics simulation. The
source tree currently contains an embedded version of box2d trunk.

Features:
- Children of the ClutterBox2d group can be simulated as static or dynamic
  rigid bodies. Collision detection.
- Specifying the gravity of the world.
- play/pause control over the box2d physics engine
- Setting linear and angular velocities of simulated children.
- automatic position synchronization between clutter and box2d.
- joints
- prismatic.
- revolute.
- distance (spring)
- mouse (for dragging objects around and manipulating them).
