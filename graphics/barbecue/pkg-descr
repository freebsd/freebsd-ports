Barbecue is an open-source, Java barcode library that provides the means to
create barcodes for printing and display in Java applications. A number of
barcode formats are supported and many more can be added via the flexible
barcode API. Barcodes can be outputted to Graphics objects, or used as a Swing
component, or written out as SVG.
