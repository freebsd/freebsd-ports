XImaging is a lightweight, multithreaded, open source image viewer for FreeBSD,
Linux and other Unix like platforms running X11. The application can be run in
viewer or browser mode. The viewer displays full size images and provides
zooming, panning, rotation and other useful functions. The browser searches a
directory for known image file types and displays them as thumbnails.
Additionally both modes provide basic file management routines. A custom tool
may be specified for opening selected files in another application for editing.

Most common raster image types are suppported directly, while filters (any
program that can write PNM/PAM data to the stdout) may be used to add support
for other kinds of image data.

The program is written in C, and uses the Motif widget toolkit. The source code
may be modified and distributed under the terms of the X/MIT license.
