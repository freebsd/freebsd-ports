This library is a wrapper around the FreeType and Harfbuzz libraries,
allowing you to use TrueType fonts to render text in SDL applications.

It allows a programmer to use multiple TrueType fonts without having
to code a font rendering routine themselves. With the power of
outline fonts and antialiasing, high quality text output can be
obtained without much effort.
