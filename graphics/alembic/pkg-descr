Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework.  It distills
complex, animated scenes into a non-procedural, application-independent
set of baked geometric results.  This "distillation" of scenes into baked
geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation of lighting and
rendering scenes into rendered image data.

Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of complex
procedural geometric constructions.  It is very specifically NOT concerned
with storing the complex dependency graph of procedural tools used to
create the computed results.
