A SANE WebScan frontend that supports Apple's AirScan protocol.
Scanners are detected automatically, and published through mDNS.
Though images may be acquired and transferred in JPEG, PNG, and
PDF/raster format through a simple web interface, AirSane's intended
purpose is to be used with AirScan/eSCL clients such as Apple's
Image Capture.

Images are encoded on-the-fly during acquisition, keeping memory/storage
demands low. Thus, AirSane will run fine on a Raspberry Pi or similar
device.

AirSane has been developed by reverse-engineering the communication
protocol implemented in Apple's AirScanScanner client (macos 10.12.6,
/System/Library/Image Capture/Devices/AirScanScanner.app).

Authentication and secure communication are not supported.

If you are looking for a powerful SANE web frontend, AirSane may
not be for you. You may be interested in phpSANE instead.
