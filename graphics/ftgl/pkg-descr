FTGL is a free open source library to enable developers to use arbitrary
fonts in their OpenGL applications. Unlike other OpenGL font libraries
FTGL uses standard font file formats so doesn't need a preprocessing step
to convert the high quality font data into a lesser quality, proprietary
format. FTGL uses the Freetype (www.freetype.org) font library to open and
'decode' the fonts. It then takes that output and stores it in a format
most efficient for OpenGL rendering.
