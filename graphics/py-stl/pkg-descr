The python modules stl.py and xform.py are for reading, creating and
transforming STL (STereoLithography) files. These modules are used by the
following scripts:

stl2pov: Converts the STL model to a mesh usable with the POV-ray raytracer.
stl2ps:  Creates a view of the STL model in scalable PostScript.
stl2pdf: Creates a view of the STL model as a PDF. Requires graphics/py-cairo
sltinfo: Either displays some information about a STL file or prints it in
text format.
