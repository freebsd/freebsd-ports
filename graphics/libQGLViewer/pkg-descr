libQGLViewer is a C++ library based on Qt that eases the creation of OpenGL
3D viewers.

It provides some of the typical 3D viewer functionalities, such as the
possibility to move the camera using the mouse, which lacks in most of the
other APIs. Other features include mouse manipulated frames, interpolated
keyFrames, object selection, stereo display, screenshot saving and much more.
It can be used by OpenGL beginners as well as to create complex applications,
being fully customizable and easy to extend.
