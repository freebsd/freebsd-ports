OpenGL hardware acceleration for RIVA based cards and Matrox G200.

To bridge the time until the XFree86-4 release, this port will build a  
Mesa 3.0 Graphics Library that makes use of the 3d hardware acceleration
features of nvidia's RIVA 128/128ZX and RIVA TNT/TNT2/VANTAGE based 
graphics cards and the Matrox G200/G400.

WARNING:

Please note that this build might need a considerable amount of time.
(AMD K6/300MHz/196MB/SCSI: XFree86 3 hours, Mesa 1/2 hour, glx 10 min)
