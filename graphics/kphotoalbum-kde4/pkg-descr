KPhotoAlbum is a tool for annotating, searching and viewing images
and videos.  The annotation is done by telling KPhotoAlbum who is
on the images, where the images were taken and (optionally) adding
descriptions.

KPhotoAlbum is highly optimized for easy annotation of images, so
that it is possible to use it with thousands of images. When the
images have been annotated, you may browse them based on the
annotations (person, location, keywords).
