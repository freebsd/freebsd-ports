The exiftags utility parses a specified JPEG file or, by default, its standard
input, looking for a JPEG APP1 section containing Exif (Exchangeable Image
File) data. The properties contained in these data are then printed to the
standard output. Digital cameras typically add Exif data to the image files
they produce, containing information about the camera and digitized image.

The program supports a variety of cameras, and includes additional support for
a portion of the maker notes for Canon, Fuji, Nikon, and Olympus cameras.
