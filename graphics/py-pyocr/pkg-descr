PyOCR is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool wrapper for python. That
is, it helps using various OCR tools from a Python program.

* Cuneiform (wrapper: fork + exec)

Features:
* Supports all the image formats supported by Pillow, including jpeg, png, gif,
  bmp, tiff and others
* Various output types: text only, bounding boxes, etc.
* Orientation detection (Tesseract and libtesseract only)
* Can focus on digits only (Tesseract and libtesseract only)
