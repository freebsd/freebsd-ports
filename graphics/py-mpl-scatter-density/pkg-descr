The mpl-scatter-density mini-package provides functionality to make it easy to
make your own scatter density maps, both for interactive and non-interactive
use. Fast. The following animation shows real-time interactive use with 10
million points, but interactive performance is still good even with 100 million
points (and more if you have enough RAM).
