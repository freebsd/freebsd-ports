Metapixel is a program for generating photomosaics. It can
generate classical photomosaics, in which the source image is
viewed as a matrix of equally sized rectangles for each of which
a matching image is substitued, as well as collage-style
photomosaics, in which rectangular parts of the source image at
arbitrary positions (i.e. not aligned to a matrix) are
substituted by matching images.
