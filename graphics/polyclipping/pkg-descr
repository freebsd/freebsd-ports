polyclipping - Polygon and line clipping and offsetting library.

The Clipper library performs clipping and offsetting for both
lines and polygons. All four boolean clipping operations are
supported - intersection, union, difference and exclusive-or.
Polygons can be of any shape including self-intersecting polygons.
