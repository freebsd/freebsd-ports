Intel Open Volume Kernel Library (Intel Open VKL) is a collection of
high-performance volume computation kernels, developed at Intel. The target
users of Open VKL are graphics application engineers who want to improve the
performance of their volume rendering applications by leveraging Open VKL's
performance-optimized kernels, which include volume traversal and sampling
functionality for a variety of volumetric data formats. The kernels are
optimized for the latest Intel processors with support for SSE, AVX, AVX2,
and AVX-512 instructions, and for ARM processors with support for NEON
instructions.
