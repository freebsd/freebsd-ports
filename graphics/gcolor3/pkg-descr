Gcolor3 enables you to pick the color from any pixel on your screen.
It also offers a palette, so that you can easily mix and match a
couple of colors together.

When you have found the perfect combination of colors, naturally you
want to save them.  Gcolor3 allows you to conveniently save and
retrieve colors.
