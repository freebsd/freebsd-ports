JpGraph is an OO class library for PHP.  JpGraph makes it easy to
draw both "quick and dirty" graphs with a minimum of code and complex
professional looking graphs which requires a very fine grain of control.
The library assigns context sensitive default values for most parameters
which helps minimize the learning curve.
