Fyre provides a rendering of the Peter de Jong map, with an interactive
GTK+ 2 frontend and a command line interface for easy and efficient
rendering of high-resolution, high quality images.

This program was previously known as 'de Jong Explorer', but has been
renamed to make way for supporting other chaotic functions.

All the images you can create with this program are based on the simple
Peter de Jong map equations:

   x' = sin(a * y) - cos(b * x)
   y' = sin(c * x) - cos(d * y)
