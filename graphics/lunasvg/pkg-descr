LunaSVG is an SVG rendering library in C++, designed to be lightweight and
portable, offering efficient rendering and manipulation of Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVG) files.

LunaSVG supports nearly all graphical features outlined in the SVG 1.1 and SVG
1.2 Tiny specifications. The primary exceptions are animation, filters, and
scripts. As LunaSVG is designed for static rendering, animation is unlikely to
be supported in the future. However, support for filters may be added. It
currently handles a wide variety of elements, including:

<a> <circle> <clipPath> <defs> <ellipse> <g> <image> <line> <linearGradient>
<marker> <mask> <path> <pattern> <polygon> <polyline> <radialGradient> <rect>
<stop> <style> <svg> <symbol> <text> <tspan> <use>
