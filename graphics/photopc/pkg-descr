This is a library and a command-line frontend to manipulate an Epson
PhotoPC digital still camera.  The camera comes with software for
Windows and for Mac, and no description of the protocol.  With this
tool, it is managable from a UNIX box.  It is quite probable that the
program will also work with Olympus Camedia camera.
