This is a module for generating fancy raster plots in color. There is support
for drawing multiple datasets on the same plot, over a background image. It's
even possible to do shadows with some thinking.

It's also possible to generate clean plots without any chartjunk at all.

The plot is generated in a few phases. First the initial plot object is
generated and contains defaults at that point. Then datasets are added with
possible drawing specifications.

Most of the actual work is delegated to Imager::Plot::Axis. See the
Imager::Plot::Axis manpage for more information on how to control grid
generation, ranges for data (zoom).
