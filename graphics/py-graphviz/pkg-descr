This package facilitates the creation and rendering of graph descriptions in the
DOT language of the Graphviz graph drawing software (repo) from Python.

Create a graph object, assemble the graph by adding nodes and edges, and
retrieve its DOT source code string. Save the source code to a file and render
it with the Graphviz installation of your system.

Use the view option/method to directly inspect the resulting (PDF, PNG, SVG,
etc.) file with its default application. Graphs can also be rendered and
displayed within Jupyter notebooks (a.k.a. IPython notebooks, example) as well
as the Jupyter Qt Console.
