dspdfviewer a simple viewer for latex-beamer presentations that are built with
the show notes on second screen option of latex-beamer. It will take your PDF
file, split it in a left and right half and render the two halves individually
to the screens.

In addition, your laptop screen will contain some counters and a wall-clock,
which may help you time your presentation right.
