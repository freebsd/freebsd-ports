Artem is a small cli program, written in rust, to easily convert
images to ASCII art, named after the latin word for art. By default it
tries to use truecolor, but if the terminal does not support
truecolor, it falls back to 16 Color ANSI. When the ASCII image is
written to a file, the image will not use colors. It supports .jpeg,
.png, .gif, .webp and many more.
