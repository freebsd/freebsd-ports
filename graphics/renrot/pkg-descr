RenRot is utility written in Perl, aiming to carry out different processing
tasks upon the image files (especially those containing EXIF data).

RenRot renames files according to the flexible name template (allowing the
DateTimeOriginal and FileModifyDate EXIF tags, if they exist, otherwise, the
name will be set according to the current time stamp).  Furthermore, RenRot
can aggregate files according to the shooting time period.

Additionally, it can losslessly rotate JPEGs and their thumbnails, based on
the Orientation EXIF tag, or a given angle.

The script can also put commentary into the Commentary and UserComment tags.
Personal details can be specified via XMP tags defined in a configuration
file.
