OpenRM Scene Graph is set of tools and utilities that implement a
high performance, flexible and extendible scene graph API. Underneath
OpenRM, OpenGL(tm) is used as the graphics platform for rendering,
so OpenRM is highly portable and can deliver blazing rendering speeds.
OpenRM can be used on any platform that has OpenGL, and has been
built and tested on:
   x86 Linux (s/w via Mesa, h/w using vendor drivers, e.g., nVidia)
   Irix
   Solaris
   FreeBSD
   Win32 (95/98/NT/2K/ME).

OpenRM is a derivative work of RM Scene Graph (tm), a commercial
scene graph product from R3vis Corporation. Late in 1999, R3vis announced
the release of OpenRM into the Open Source community, with the
OpenRM debut occuring on 1 March 2000. R3vis continues to maintain
and develop RM Scene Graph, which contains additional features not
present in OpenRM.
