Peps will preprocess encapsulated Postscript files for conversion by
Ghostscript into bitmaps.  It provides variable levels of resolution and
anti-aliasing.  You can use it as a stand-alone Postscript-to-bitmap
conversion program, or use it on-line to create bitmaps on the fly and send
them out to a web browser, even compressing them if the browser supports
gzip compression.

Xpeps is peps with X11 support.
