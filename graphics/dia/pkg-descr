Dia is a GTK+ based diagram creation program released under the GPL license. 

Dia is designed to be much like the commercial Windows program
'Visio'. It can be used to draw different kind of diagrams. In this
first version there is support for UML static structure diagrams
(class diagrams) and network diagrams. It can currently load and
save diagrams to a custom fileformat and export to postscript.
