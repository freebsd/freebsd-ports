Library to convert TIFF files into multi-page TIFF files. It contains only one
function callable by programs:

	int TiffAppend(const char *outfile, const char *infile);

It will insert images from infile as additional pages to outfile. Infile
and outfile must be names of two existing TIFF files.

The function returns 0 on success, non-0 otherwise.

The code for this library was written by Peter van Vloten <pixelpan@aol.com>
and was published in May 1999 issue of Windows Developer's Journal (sic!).
