Chart::Clicker aims to be a powerful, extensible charting package that
creates really pretty output.

Clicker leverages the power of Cairo to create snazzy 2D graphics easily and
quickly.

At it's core Clicker is more of a toolkit for creating charts. It's
interface is a bit more complex because making pretty charts requires
attention and care. Some fine defaults are established to make getting
started easier, but to really unleash the potential of Clicker you must roll
up your sleeves and build things by hand.
