Google's excellent Visualization suite requires you to format your Javascript
data very carefully. It's entirely possible to do this by hand, especially with
the help of the most excellent JSON::XS but it's a bit fiddly, largely because
Perl doesn't natively support data types and Google's API accepts a super-set of
JSON - see "JSON vs Javascript" below.

This module is attempts to hide the gory details of preparing your data before
sending it to a JSON serializer - more specifically, hiding some of the hoops
that have to be jump through for making sure your data serializes to the right
data types.

Every effort has been made to keep naming conventions as close as possible to
those in the API itself.
