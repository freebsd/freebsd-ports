Idea and purpose of this program is the calculation of three-dimensional
fractals. The calculated objects are twisted, freely in space
floating (and - of course - fractal) "lumps" which look like made
of dough - in contrast to what is normally called "three-dimensional"
fractals (namely a simple reinterpretation of the two-dimensional
data).

Generation of a really three dimensional view is possible (3d
stereo). The fractal can be seen three dimensional without any
utilities like 3d glasses.
