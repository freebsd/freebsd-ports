facedetect is a simple face detector for batch processing. It answers the basic
question: "Is there a face in this image?" and gives back either an exit code or
the coordinates of each detected face in the standard output.

The aim is to provide a basic command-line interface that's consistent and easy
to use with software such as ImageMagick, while progressively improving the
detection algorithm over time.
