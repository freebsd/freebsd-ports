Piglit is a collection of automated tests for OpenGL and OpenCL
implementations.

The goal of Piglit is to help improve the quality of open source
OpenGL and OpenCL drivers by providing developers with a simple means to
perform regression tests.

The original tests have been taken from
- Glean ( http://glean.sf.net/ ) and
- Mesa ( http://www.mesa3d.org/ )
