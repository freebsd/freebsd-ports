This is an image file viewer with thumbnail-based file selector. it uses GTK+
and Imlib libraries and support most image file formats. The thumbnail file is
compatible with xv and Gimp.

In contrast to other image file viewers for X, xzgv uses only one window and
can fit a large image to the size of the window without changing the aspect
ratio.
