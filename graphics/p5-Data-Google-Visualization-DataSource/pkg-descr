Perl helper class for implementing the Google Chart Tools Datasource Protocol.

The Google Visualization API is a nifty bit of kit for generating pretty

as non-standard JSON and stuffing configuration options in to a single CGI
query parameter.

Data::Google::Visualization::DataTable takes care of preparing data for the
API.
