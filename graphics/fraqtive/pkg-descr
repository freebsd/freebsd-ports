Fraqtive is a program for drawing Mandelbrot and Julia fractals. It uses a
very fast algorithm and generates high quality, smooth images. It is fully
interactive, allowing for real-time mouse navigation and dynamic generation
of the Julia fractal preview. OpenGL-rendered 3D view of the fractals is
also supported.
