Libpng was written as a companion to the PNG specification, as a
way to reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to support
the PNG file format in application programs.  Most users will not
have to modify the library significantly; advanced users may want
to modify it more.  The library was coded for both users.  All
attempts were made to make it as complete as possible, while
keeping the code easy to understand.  Currently, this library
only supports C.  Support for other languages is being considered.
