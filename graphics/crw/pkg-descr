This is the distribution of "crw", a powerful utility that processes
RAW (.crw) files from Canon digital cameras and converts them into
.ppm image files.  You can then do further conversion using ImageMagick's
'convert' utility, or gimp.  The utility does excellent smoothing and
low-light enhancement.
