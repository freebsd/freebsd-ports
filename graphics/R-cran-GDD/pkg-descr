GDD is a graphics device for R which uses libgd for creating bitmap output.
Supported output formats are png8, png24, gif and jpeg.

The main purpose of this package is to replace png/jpeg and similar native
devices in R which either rely on X11 or use GhostScript are thus are very slow
and not suitable in server applications. GDD also supports advanced features
such as anti-aliasing of both lines and text.
