Apache XML Graphics Commons is a library that consists of several reusable
components used by Apache Batik and Apache FOP. Many of these components can
easily be used separately outside the domains of SVG and XSL-FO. You will
find components such as a PDF library, an RTF library, Graphics2D
implementations that let you generate PDF & PostScript files, and much more.
