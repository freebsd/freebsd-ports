FreeImage is an Open Source library project for developers who would like to
support popular graphics image formats like PNG, BMP, JPEG, TIFF and others as
needed by today's multimedia applications. FreeImage is easy to use, fast,
multithreading safe, compatible with all 32-bit versions of Windows, and
cross-platform (works both with Linux and Mac OS X).
