This package contains standalone drivers for GRASS raster and vector files that
can be built after GDAL has been built and installed as an "autoload" driver.

This is particularly useful in resolving problems with GRASS depending on GDAL,
but GDAL with GRASS support depending on GRASS. With this package you can
configure and install GDAL normally (--without-grass), then build and install
GRASS normally and finally build and install this driver.
