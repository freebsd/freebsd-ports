SpringGraph.pm is a rewrite of the springgraph.pl script, which provides
similar functionality to Neato and can read some/most dot files.

The goal of this module is to provide a compatible interface to VCG
and/or GraphViz perl modules on CPAN. This module will also provide some
extra features to provide more flexibility and power.

This module is still experimental and is moving quickly away from the
original springgraph.pl code. It is likely to be rewritten from basic
principles in the near future to remove some of the quirks inherent in
the Autodia and springgraph.pl code used.
