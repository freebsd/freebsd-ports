The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform open-source
C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms
for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform.
OpenGL core and extension functionality is exposed in a single header file.
GLEW has been tested on a variety of operating systems, including Windows,
Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Irix, and Solaris.

This is the linux verson.
