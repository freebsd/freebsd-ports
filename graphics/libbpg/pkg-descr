BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is a new image format. Its purpose is to
replace the JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue. Its
main advantages are:
 - High compression ratio. Files are much smaller than JPEG for similar
   quality.
 - Supported by most Web browsers with a small Javascript decoder (gzipped
   size: 56 KB).
 - Based on a subset of the HEVC open video compression standard.
 - Supports the same chroma formats as JPEG (grayscale, YCbCr 4:2:0, 4:2:2,
   4:4:4) to reduce the losses during the conversion. An alpha channel is
   supported. The RGB, YCgCo and CMYK color spaces are also supported.
 - Native support of 8 to 14 bits per channel for a higher dynamic range.
 - Lossless compression is supported.
 - Various metadata (such as EXIF, ICC profile, XMP) can be included.
 - Animation support.
