This software provides support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF),
a widely used format for storing image data.

Included in this software distribution is a library, libtiff, for
reading and writing TIFF images, a small collection of tools for doing
simple manipulations of TIFF images, and documentation for the library
and tools.

The library is capable of dealing with images that are written to
follow the 5.0 or 6.0 TIFF spec.  There is also considerable support
for some of the more esoteric portions of the 6.0 TIFF spec.
