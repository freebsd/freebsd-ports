KDE Image Database (KimDaBa) is a tool for annotating, searching, and viewing
images. The annotation is done by telling KimDaBa who is on the images, where
the images were taken, and (optionally) adding descriptions.

KimDaBa is highly optimized for easy annotating of images, so that it is
possible to use it with thousands of images. When the images have been
annotated you may browse them based on the annotations (person, location,
keywords).
