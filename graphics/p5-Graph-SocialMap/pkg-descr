This module implement a interesting graph application that is called the 
'Social Relation Map'. It provides object-oriented way to retrieve many 
social information that can be found in this map.

The new() constructor accepts one argument in the for of 'hashref of 
arrayref'. The key to this hash is the name of relation, and the value of 
the hash is a list of identities involved in this relation.

Take the synopsis for an example, the structure:

    my $relation = {
        'WorkWith' => [qw/Marry Rose/],
        'ChatWith' => [qw/Marry Peacock/],
        'DanceWith' => [qw/Rose Joan/],
        'HackWith' => [qw/Gugod Autrijus/],
    };

Defines 4 issues which have common people involves in, the relation 
'WorkWith' involves Marry and Rose, and the relation 'ChatWith' involves 
Marry and Peacock. By this 2 relations, we say that Marry is directly 
connected to Rose and Peacock, and Rose and Peacock are connected to each 
other indirectly, with degree of separation 1. Likewise, Marry and Joan 
are connected to each other with degree of separation 2.
