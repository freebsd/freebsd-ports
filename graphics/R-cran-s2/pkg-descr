Provides R bindings for Google's s2 library for geometric calculations
on the sphere. High-performance constructors and exporters provide
high compatibility with existing spatial packages, transformers
construct new geometries from existing geometries, predicates provide
a means to select geometries based on spatial relationships, and
accessors extract information about geometries.
