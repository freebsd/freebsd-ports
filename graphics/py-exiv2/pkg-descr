pyexiv2 is a python binding to exiv2, the C++ library for manipulation of
EXIF and IPTC image metadata. It is a python module that allows your python
scripts to read and write metadata (EXIF, IPTC, thumbnail) embedded in image
files (JPEG, TIFF, ...).

It is designed as a high level interface to the functionalities offered by
exiv2 (and is built on top of it). Using python's built-in data types and
standard modules, it provides easy manipulation of image metadata.
