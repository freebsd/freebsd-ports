SDL_ttf is a TrueType font rendering library that is used with the
SDL library, and almost as portable. It depends on freetype2 to
handle the TrueType font data. It allows a programmer to use multiple
TrueType fonts without having to code a font rendering routine
themselves. With the power of outline fonts and antialiasing, high
quality text output can be obtained without much effort.
