# The Color Transformation Language #

The Color Transformation Language, or CTL, is a programming language for digital
color management.

Digital color management requires translating digital images between different
representations or color spaces.  For example, the pixels in an image may encode
the colors that should be seen when the image is displayed on a video monitor.
Printing this image on paper, or recording it on motion picture film requires
transforming the pixels to an appropriate representation: Video, inks on paper
and film all have different color gamuts and dynamic ranges.  Color mixing is
additive for video, but subtractive for inks and film. Video and film typically
use three color channels, while four or more inks are used for printing on
paper. A color management system must transform each pixel in the original image
to corresponding amounts of ink or film density values.
