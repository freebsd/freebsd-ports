pdfpc is a GTK based presentation viewer application which uses Keynote
like multi-monitor output to provide meta information to the speaker
during the presentation. It is able to show a normal presentation window
on one screen, while showing a more sophisticated overview on the other
one providing information like a picture of the next slide, as well as
the left over time till the end of the presentation. The input files
processed by pdfpc are PDF documents, which can be created using nearly
any of today's presentation software.
