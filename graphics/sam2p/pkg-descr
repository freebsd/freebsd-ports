sam2p is a UNIX command line utility written in ANSI C++ that converts many
raster (bitmap) image formats into Adobe PostScript or PDF files and several
other formats. The images are not vectorized. sam2p gives full control to the
user to specify standards-compliance, compression, and bit depths. In some
cases sam2p can compress an image 100 times smaller than the PostScript output
of many other common image converters. sam2p provides ZIP, RLE and LZW
(de)compression filters even on Level1 devices.
