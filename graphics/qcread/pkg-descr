This program supports both color and B&W parallel-port Connectix QuickCam
for PC All modes are supported except color QuickCam "thousands colors" 
compressed download and 640x480 "billions colors" mode. "Thousands" is 
unsupported because of the lack of information and will be added if 
Connectix will give the documentation on it to developers in the same or 
similar way, the documentation on other modes was given that made this 
program possible. "Billions colors" will be supported in later releases.
