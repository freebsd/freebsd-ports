Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) are parametric functions which can
represent any type of curves or surfaces.  This C++ library hides the basic
mathematics of NURBS, allowing the user to focus on the more challenging
parts of their projects.

The NURBS++ package includes a matrix library, an image manipulation
library, a numerical library and a NURBS library.
