PhotoCollage allows you to create photo collage posters. It assembles the input
photographs it is given to generate a big poster. Photos are automatically
arranged to fill the whole poster, then you can change the final layout,
dimensions, border or swap photos in the generated grid. Eventually the final
poster image can be saved in any size.
