GIMPshop is a fork of GIMP which changes the layout of the user interface
to resemble Adobe Photoshop.

The Gimp's menu structure and naming conventions are a constant source
of frustration for those who are familiar with Photoshop.
The main purpose for GIMPshop is to make the Gimp accessible to the
many Adobe Photoshop users out there.
GIMP's tools, options, windows, and menus have been renamed and
reorganized to closely resemble Adobe Photoshop's menu structure and
naming conventions. Many of the menu options and even whole menus were
recreated to faithfully reproduce a Photoshop-like experience. After
running GIMPshop, you'll find that Photoshop and the GIMP are strikingly
similar.
Longtime Photoshop users should feel very comfortable using GIMPshop.
