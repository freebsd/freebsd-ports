Image::Imlib2 is a Perl port of Imlib2, a graphics library
that does image file loading and saving as well as manipulation,
arbitrary polygon support, etc. It does ALL of these operations
FAST. It allows you to create colour images using a large number
of graphics primitives, and output the images in a range of formats.
