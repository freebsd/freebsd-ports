GLText is a portable font rendering library for C++ OpenGL applications. It
uses FreeType2 to read and render high-quality TrueType fonts with a minimal
footprint. With just a few easy lines of C++, you can add gorgeously
rendered text to your graphical applications.

GLText is an open source project licensed under the LGPL. Basically this means
that you can use and link your application with it regardless of what license
your application uses. If you make changes to GLText, however,
you must make those changes open source under the LGPL.

Written with portablility in mind, GLText works on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and
IRIX - virtually anywhere that FreeType2 supports.
