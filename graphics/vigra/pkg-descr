VIGRA stands for "Vision with Generic Algorithms". It's a novel computer
vision library that puts its main emphasize on customizable algorithms
and data structures. By using template techniques similar to those in
the C++ Standard Template Library, you can easily adapt any VIGRA
component to the needs of your application, without thereby giving up
execution speed.
