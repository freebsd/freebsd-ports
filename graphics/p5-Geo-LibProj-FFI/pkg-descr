Geo::LibProj::FFI is a foreign function interface to the PROJ coordinate
transformation / projection library. Please see the PROJ library's C function
reference for further documentation. You should be able to use those C functions
as if they were Perl.

Geo::LibProj::FFI offers a large portion of the most commonly used PROJ
functions, but more could be added later. If you need a function that isn't yet
available in this module, please open a GitHub issue with a description of your
use case.
