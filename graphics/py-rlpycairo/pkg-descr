This is a plugin for the ReportLab PDF Toolkit, which constructs rich PDF
documents, and is also used for the creation of charts in a variety of bitmap
and vector formats.

This plugin is intended to replace most of the usage of the libart based
C extension _renderPM which has been shown to have issues when rendering
complex documents.
