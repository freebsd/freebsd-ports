Fujiplay is a C program for Unix systems, to download pictures from some
Fujifilm digital cameras, like the DS-7 and MX-700, using the serial link.

* Tries to determine the maximum speed supported by the camera.
* Detect all parity errors (not tested), improving the robustness of the
  one-byte xor checksum. 
* It will not overwrite picture files without your consent. 
* Detect disk full errors (not tested).
* You cannot have a truncated image file.
* The program can be gracefully interrupted with ^C (or whatever your
  interrupt character is).
* Allows you to upload pictures to the camera, delete
  pictures from the camera, and to "press the shutter" remotely.
  You can also set the time/date and the "camera ID".
* The source should be reasonably portable to other, non-POSIX systems.

After installation with this port, you should be symlink /dev/fujifilm to
your serial line device through which comunicate with your camera.
