Graphos roots are directly set in GDraw, written by Enrico Sersale and released
in 2000. Version 0.1 of Graphos is a direct descendant of GDraw: the interface
is almost unchanged, but the application has been refactored, reorganized,
debugged, rewritten and updated.

The main changes were the transition from post-script to NSBezierPath drawing,
total rearrangement of the objects into Drawable Objects and their Editors
organized hierachically and the porting to Macintosh.
