A pandas-centric interface to highly performant travel network analysis
leveraging contraction hierarchies provided by code from the Open Source Routing
Machine (OSRM). Hence, the pandas routing machine, pandarm. This package is a
friendly fork of the pandana library, originally written by Fletcher Foti and
UrbanSim Inc. Despite fantastic work by the original authors, maintaining
open-source software is a great deal of work and the pandana library is no
longer compatible with the current pydata stack (specifically as of numpy
version 2.0). This fork reinstates compatibility and brings along a few new
modern touches and enhancements. Pull requests are very welcome.

Main features of the package include:
- multi-threaded calculation of shortest path routes and distances
- network aggregations (i.e. accessibility metrics)
- network-based isochrones
