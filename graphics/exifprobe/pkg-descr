[From exifprobe(1)]

Exifprobe examines and reports the contents and structure of JPEG and
TIFF image files. It will recognize all standard JPEG markers  (including
APPn  markers) and will report the contents of any properly structured TIFF 
IFD encountered, even when entry tags  are  not  recognized. Recognized  TIFF 
and TIFF/EP tags are expanded, including  EXIF2.2 sections and camera MakerNotes
which are found to be in TIFF  IFD  format. Location, size, and format of image
data is reported by default.
