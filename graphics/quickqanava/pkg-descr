QuickQanava is a C++14 library designed to display graphs and relational content
in a QtQuick application. QuickQanava provide QML components and C++ classes
to visualize medium-sized directed graphs in a C++/QML application. QuickQanava
does not provide advanced layout algorithms, but rather focus on displaying
relational content in advanced dynamic user interfaces (with DnD support,
resizable content, visual connection of nodes).
