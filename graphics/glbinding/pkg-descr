glbinding leverages C++11 features like enum classes, lambdas, and
variadic templates, instead of relying on macros; all OpenGL symbols
are real functions and variables. It provides type-safe parameters,
per-feature API headers, lazy function resolution, multi-context and
multi-thread support, global and local function callbacks, meta
information about the generated OpenGL binding and the OpenGL runtime,
as well as tools and examples for quick-starting your projects. Based
on the OpenGL API specification (gl.xml) glbinding is generated using
python scripts and templates that can be easily adapted to fit custom
needs.
