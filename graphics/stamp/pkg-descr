Stamp is a command-line program which will process a greyscale jpeg image,
such as one produced by a greyscale Quickcam. It can add a graphical (and 
configurable) timestamp to the image. Stamp can also upload the timestamped 
image via FTP, with the configuration of a stamprc file. It also features a 
"quad" option which will take the latest image and composite it with up to 
three previous images, while timestamping the latest one.
