		    DynaMechs (Dynamics of Mechanisms)
		A Multibody Dynamics Simulation Library

This is a set of cross-platform C++ libraries licensed under the Gnu's GPL
(see LICENSE) which implements dynamic simulation functionality for multibody
systems.  It currently supports all tree structured mechanism, a class of
closed chain mechanisms as well.  It has provisions for generating both
single and double precision version, and there is code for simplified
hydrodynamic simulation.

This work is an extension of my Ph.D. dissertation, "Computational Dynamics
for Robotic Systems on Land and Underwater," The Ohio State University, 1994,
and continued at the Naval Postgraduate School.

The closed chain work is derived from Duane Marhefka's Ph.D. dissertation,
"Fuzzy Control and Dynamic Simulation of a Quadruped Galloping Machine," The
Ohio State University, 2000.
