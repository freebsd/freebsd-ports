The JOGL project hosts the development version of the Java Binding for
the OpenGL API (JSR-231), and is designed to provide hardware-
supported 3D graphics to applications written in Java.  JOGL provides
full access to the APIs in the OpenGL 2.0 specification as well as
nearly all vendor extensions, and integrates with the AWT and Swing
widget sets.  It is part of a suite of open-source technologies
initiated by the Game Technology Group at Sun Microsystems.
