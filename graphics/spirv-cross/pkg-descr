SPIRV-Cross is a tool designed for parsing and converting SPIR-V to other shader
languages.

Features:
* Convert SPIR-V to readable, usable and efficient GLSL
* Convert SPIR-V to readable, usable and efficient Metal Shading Language (MSL)
* Convert SPIR-V to readable, usable and efficient HLSL
* Convert SPIR-V to a JSON reflection format
* Convert SPIR-V to debuggable C++ [DEPRECATED]
* Reflection API to simplify the creation of Vulkan pipeline layouts
* Reflection API to modify and tweak OpDecorations
* Supports "all" of vertex, fragment, tessellation, geometry and compute shaders

SPIRV-Cross tries hard to emit readable and clean output from the SPIR-V.
The goal is to emit GLSL or MSL that looks like it was written by a human and
not awkward IR/assembly-like code.
