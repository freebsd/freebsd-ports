Graph.pm is a wrapper module that allows easy generation of graphs within perl.
Currently Graph.pm supports three graphing packages, gnuplot, XRT, and Xmgrace.
These software packages must be obtained separately from this Perl module.
Information on each graphing package and it's availability is provided in the
documentation on that module.
