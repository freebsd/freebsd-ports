Graphene contains optimizations for speeding up vector operations, those
optimizations are optional, and used only if both Graphene was compiled
with support for them and if the system you're running on has them.
Currently, Graphene supports the following platform-specific fast paths:

Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) 2
ARM NEON
GCC vector extensions
In the remote case in which none of these optimizations are available,
Graphene will fall back to a naive scalar implementation

Graphene can, optionally, provide types for integrating with GObject
properties and signals, as well as introspection information for its
use with other languages through introspection-based bindings.
