Copperspice is a C++ library derived from the existing Qt 4.8 framework.
The goal was to change the core design of the libraries, leveraging
template functionality and C++11 capabilities.

The redesign allowed the Qt Meta-Object Compiler (moc) system to be
completely removed.  Moc is a code generator and does not support many
aspects of C++ including templates, complex data types, static type
checking, and relies heavily on string comparisons. Removing moc improves
runtime performance, reduces the complexity of the build process, and
allows more issues to be detected at compile time.

Key features:
  * Qt Meta-Object Compiler (moc) is obsolete
  * Written in C++11
  * Library links directory to any standard C++ application
  * A template class can inherit from QObject
  * Copperspice includes several Qt5 classes
