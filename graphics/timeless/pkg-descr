This is a FreeBSD/SDL port of Tran's timeless demo written in 1994. The demo
is like a screen saver, there is stuff warping around onscreen, colors are
changing and sprites are moving all over the place.  The original conversion
from ASM to C for Linux/SDL was written by Dave Ashley.  I enabled fullscreen
and added music to this version.  Hope you like it!
