DjVu  is a  web-centric format  and software  platform for  distributing
documents   and   images.DjVu   was  originally   developped   at   AT&T
Labs-Research  by Leon  Bottou, Yann  LeCun, Patrick  Haffner, and  many
others.  In March  2000,  AT&T  sold DjVu  to  LizardTech  Inc. who  now
distributes  Windows/Mac plug-ins,  and commercial  encoders (mostly  on
Windows)

The LizardTech released  the reference implementation of  DjVu under the
GNU  GPL in  October  2000. DjVuLibre  (which means  free  DjVu), is  an
enhanced version  of that code  maintained by the original  inventors of
DjVu. It is compatible with version  3.5 of the LizardTech DjVu software
suite.  DjVulibre-3.5 contains:
	- a standalone DjVu viewer based on the Qt library. 
	- A browser plugin that works with most Unix browsers.
	  (such as Mozilla and Opera)
	- A full-fledged wavelet-based compressor for pictures. 
	- A simple compressor for bitonal (black and white) scanned pages. 
	- A compressor for palettized images (a la GIF/PNG). 
	- A set of utilities to manipulate and assemble DjVu images and
	  documents. 
	- A set of decoders to convert DjVu to a number of other formats. 
	- An up-to-date version of the C++ DjVu Reference Library.
