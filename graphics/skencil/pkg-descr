Skencil is an interactive vector drawing program for X (similar to XFig
or tgif). It is written almost completely in Python, an object oriented
interpreted programming language.

This is a stable release. It is quite featureful and usable, but there
are still things missing that I want in a 1.0 release, hence the low
version number.

Skencil was originally named "Sketch" and the name "Sketch" is still
used is many places.
