XFIG - Facility for Interactive Generation of figures under X11

Xfig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects
interactively in an X window.  The resulting pictures can be saved, printed
on postscript printers or converted to a variety of other formats (e.g. to
allow inclusion in LaTeX documents).

To enjoy the beautiful colors, specify "*customization: -color" in your
.Xdefaults or .Xresources file.

Xfig is internationlized from version 3.2.  To use i18n feature, type
$ xfig -international  [-inputStyle OverTheSpot]
Xfig acts as non-i18n version without -international option. If you put
"Fig.international: true" into your resource file, -international option may
omitted.

ja_JP.EUC and ko_KR.EUC is tested for input, display, and printing.
For zh_CN.EUC, only display is confirmed.

Read /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xfig/xfig.html for more information.
