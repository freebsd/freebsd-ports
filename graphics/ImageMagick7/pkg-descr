ImageMagick is a package for display and interactive manipulation of
images. The package includes tools for image conversion, annotation,
compositing, animation, and creating montages. ImageMagick can read and
write many of the more popular image formats (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, PNM, XPM,
Photo CD, etc.).

The package can be built _without_ the GUI (X11) support at all -- it
will not have the display, import, and animate functionality, but remain
extremely useful for image manipulation.

The optional "display" utility conflicts with the utility of the
same name from the misc/display port/package.
