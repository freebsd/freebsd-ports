Aeskulap is a medical image viewer. It is able to load a series of
special images stored in the DICOM format for review. Additionally
Aeskulap is able to query and fetch DICOM images from archive nodes
(also called PACS) over the network. The goal of this project is to
create a full open source replacement for commercially available DICOM
viewers.
