Aeskulap is a medical image viewer. It is able to load a series of special
images stored in the DICOM format for review. Additionally Aeskulap is able
to query and fetch DICOM images from archive nodes (also called PACS) over
the network. The goal of this project is to create a full open source
replacement for commercially available DICOM viewers.
