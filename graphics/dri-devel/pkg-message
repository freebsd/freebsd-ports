***********************************************************************
You have installed dri-devel, unstable DRI drivers.  If you just wanted
hardware 3d support, XFree86 comes with support for most people and
you should reinstall XFree86-4-Server.  Use this at your own risk.
***********************************************************************

For R200 (8500) support you will require an updated DRM. Radeon 1
users will need an updated DRM if they want TCL (Transform & Lighting)
support.

To do this, remove drm-kmod if you have it, and remove the DRM from
your kernel if you have it. You need /sys to point to the source
for your kernel. Then from this port's directory:

$ make configure
$ cd work/xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/bsd/drm/kernel
$ make -f Makefile.bsd depend all install

This installs to your kernel's module directory, so you will have
to redo this after each kernel install.
