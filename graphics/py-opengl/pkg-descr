An interface between the Python programming language and the OpenGL library
(and related libraries).

Synopsis

The PyOpenGL package provides interfaces to: 

     - The OpenGL library itself, which is a three-dimensional graphical
     rendering interface.  For more information, visit
     http://www.opengl.org.

     - The GLU library which provides access to routines for doing
     quadrics, tesselation etc.

     - The GLUT (GL UTilitity) library from Mark Kilgard, which provides a
     windowing environment.

     - The Togl (Tk/OpenGL) widget from Brian Paul and Ben Benderson (an
     alternative to GLUT which interfaces to Tk).

The Python bindings offer some value-added tools in addition to the
standard API, including support for fast processing of arrays of
coordinates, trackball support, etc.
