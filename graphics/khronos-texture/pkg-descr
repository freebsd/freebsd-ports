KTX (Khronos Texture) is a lightweight container for textures for OpenGL(R),
Vulkan(R) and other GPU APIs. KTX files contain all the parameters needed
for texture loading. A single file can contain anything from a simple
base-level 2D texture through to a cubemap array texture with mipmaps.
Contained textures can be in a Basis Universal format, in any of the
block-compressed formats supported by OpenGL family and Vulkan APIs and
extensions or in an uncompressed single-plane format. Basis Universal
currently encompasses two formats that can be quickly transcoded to any
GPU-supported format: LZ/ETC1S, which combines block-compression and
supercompression, and UASTC, a block-compressed format. Formats other than
LZ/ETC1S can be supercompressed with Zstd and ZLIB.
