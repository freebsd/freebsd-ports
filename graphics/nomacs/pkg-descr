nomacs is small, fast and able to handle the most common image
formats. Additionally it is possible to synchronize multiple
viewers. A synchronization of viewers running on the same computer
or via LAN is possible. It allows to compare images and spot the
differences (e.g.  schemes of architects to show the progress).
