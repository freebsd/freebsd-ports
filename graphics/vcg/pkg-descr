The VCG tool reads a textual and readable specification of a graph and
visualizes the graph. If not all positions of nodes are fixed, the tool
layouts the graph using several heuristics as reducing the number of
crossings, minimizing the size of edges, centering of nodes. The
specification language of the VCG tool is nearly compatible to GRL, the
language of the edge tool, but contains many extensions. The VCG tool
allows folding of dynamically or statically specified regions of the
graph. It uses colors and runs on X11. (An older version runs on
Sunview).
