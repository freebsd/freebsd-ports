OpenSubdiv is a set of open source libraries that implement high performance
subdivision surface (subdiv) evaluation on massively parallel CPU and GPU
architectures. This codepath is optimized for drawing deforming subdivs with
static topology at interactive framerates. The resulting limit surface
matches Pixar's Renderman to numerical precision.
