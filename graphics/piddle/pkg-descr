PIDDLE - Plug-In Drawing, Does Little Else
------------------------------------------

PIDDLE is a Python module for creating two-dimensional graphics in a
manner that is both cross-platform and cross-media; that is, it can
support screen graphics (e.g.  QuickDraw, Windows, Tk) as well as file
output (PostScript, PDF, GIF, etc.). It makes use of the native 2D
drawing calls of each backend, for maximum efficiency and quality. It
works by defining a base class (piddle.Canvas) with methods for all
supported drawing primitives. A particular drawing context is provided
in the form of a derived class. PIDDLE applications will be able to
automatically select an appropriate backend for the user's environment.
