LibGGI, the dynamic GGI (General Graphics Interface) library is a flexible
drawing library.

It provides an opaque interface to the display's acceleration functions.  It
was originally intended to allow user programs to interface with KGI, the GGI
Kernel Graphics Interface, but other display types can be easily used by
loading the appropriate "display target" (e.g. X, memory).

LibGGI consists of a main library (libggi.so) and a multitude of dynamic
drivers.  The library then loads the necessary "drivers" for the requested
mode, taking hints from the graphics device if necessary.  LibGGI can also
load extension libraries, e.g. to provide enhanced 2D and 3D functions.
