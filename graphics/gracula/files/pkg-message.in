        Please read the file %%DOCSDIR%%/README
        to learn how to use Graphic Counter Language (if you haven't
	installed with -D NOPORTDOCS).

        An introductory tutorial, and a GCL FAQ, can be found at
        http://www.whizkidtech.redprince.net/gcl/
        You should read both to take full advantage of the power
        of Graphic Counter Language.

        Also, sample scripts and graphics are available from
        Count Gracula's Gallery,
