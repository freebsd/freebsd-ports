Durdraw is an ASCII, Unicode and ANSI art editor for UNIX-like systems
(Linux, macOS, etc). It runs in modern Utf-8 terminals and supports frame-based
animation, custom themes, 256 and 16 color modes, terminal mouse input, DOS ANSI
art viewing, CP437 and Unicode mixing and conversion, HTML output, mIRC color
output, and other interesting features.

Durdraw is heavily inspired by classic ANSI editing software for MS-DOS and
Windows, such as TheDraw, Aciddraw and Pablodraw, but with a modern Unix twist.
