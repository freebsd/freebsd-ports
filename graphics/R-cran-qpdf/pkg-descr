Content-preserving transformations of PDF files such as split, combine, and
compress.
This package interfaces directly to the 'qpdf' C++ library
<https://qpdf.sourceforge.io/> and does not require any command line
utilities.
Note that 'qpdf' does not read actual content from PDF files: to extract text
and data you need the 'pdftools' package.
