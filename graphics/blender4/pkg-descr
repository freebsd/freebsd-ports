Blender is a free and fully functional 3D
modeling/rendering/animation/gaming package.

This port provides v4.5 of blender for file compatibility with
older versions. Some changes in file format can prevent v5.x from
opening older files while this version can open both old and new.
See https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/core/ for more info.
