G'MIC stands for GREYC's Magic Image Converter. This project aims to:

  * Define a minimal but powerful script language (G'MIC) dedicated to the
    design of image processing pipelines.
  * Provide an interpreter of this language (in C++), distributed as an
    open-source module/library embeddable in third-party applications.
  * Propose two binary tools embedding this interpreter :
    o The command-line executable gmic to use the G'MIC framework from a shell.
    o The interactive plug-in gmic_gimp to bring G'MIC capabilities to the image
      retouching software GIMP.
