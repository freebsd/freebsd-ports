HDR Tools is a set of command-line tools for creating and manipulating High
Dynamic Range (HDR) images.  It consists of six programs: hdr_create,
hdr_fix_ca, hdr_denoise, hdr_squish, hdr_adjust, and hdr_convert.

Together, they can convert a set of bracketed photographs to HDR image (in
EXR format), fix chromatic aberrations and CCD noise, perform tone mapping
and some simple color manipulations, apply gamma correction and optionally
adjust the exposure, crop, and finally convert the result into a "normal"
image (a JPG, for example).
