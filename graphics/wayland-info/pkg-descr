wayland-info is a utility for displaying information about the Wayland
protocols supported by a Wayland compositor.

It can be used to check which Wayland protocols and versions are advertised
by the Wayland compositor.

wayland-info also provides additional information for a subset of Wayland
protocols it knows about, namely Linux DMABUF, presentation time, tablet and
XDG output protocols.
