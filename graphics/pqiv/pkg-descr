Originally, PQIV was written as a drop-in replacement for QIV. The first
release was not more than a Python script, hence the name. Now, PQIV is
a (modulo some small extras) full featured clone of QIV written in C
using GTK-2 and GLIB-2.

Features include:
* Command line image viewer
* Directory traversing to view whole directories
* Watch files and directories for changes
* Natural order sorting of the images
* A status bar showing information on the current image
* Transparency and animation support
* Moving, zooming, rotation, flipping
* Slideshows
* Highly customizable
* Supports external image filters (e.g. convert)
* Preloads the next image in the background
* Fade between images
* Optional PDF/eps/ps support (useful e.g. for scientific plots)
* Optional video format support (e.g. for webm animations)
