WhirlGIF  ,  a tool for making GIF animations.

whirlgif is a quick program that reads a series of GIF files, and produces
a single gif file composed of those images.

For example, if you have images img0001.gif, img0002.gif, img0003.gif ...... 
and want to loop 100 times, then you can do something like:

	whirlgif -loop 100 img*.gif

to create an animation.
