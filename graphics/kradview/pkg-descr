Kradview is a GPLed viewer of images obtained for some different
sources: X-ray, NMR and DICOM-compatible imaging devices that
runs on free operating systems. Its aim is a easy to use DICOM
viewer with instant rendering of images, no matter the size and
the zoom of the DICOM image. It covers the "let's see the the
X-ray image" need of the medical professional.
