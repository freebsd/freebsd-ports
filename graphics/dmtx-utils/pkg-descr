dmtx-utils - software for reading and writing Data Matrix barcodes

libdmtx is open source software for reading and writing Data Matrix
barcodes on Linux, Unix, OS X, Windows, and certain mobile devices.
The included utility programs, dmtxread and dmtxwrite, serve as the
official interface to libdmtx from the command line, and also provide
a good reference for programmers who wish to write their own programs
that interact with libdmtx.

Data Matrix barcodes are two-dimensional symbols that hold a dense
pattern of data with built-in error correction. The Data Matrix
symbology (sometimes casually referred to as "DataMatrix") was invented
and released into the public domain by RVSI Acuity CiMatrix.
