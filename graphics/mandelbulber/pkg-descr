Mandelbulber is an experimental application that helps to make
rendering 3D Mandelbrot fractals much more accessible. A few of the
supported 3D fractals: Mandelbulb, Mandelbox, BulbBox, JuliaBulb,
Menger Sponge, Quaternion, Trigonometric, Hypercomplex, and Iterated
Function Systems (IFS). All of these can be combined into infinite
variations with the ability to hybridize different formulas together.
