Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) is an Open Source, free of charge graphic library,
written in industrially standard C++. AGG doesn't depend on any graphic API or
technology. Basically, you can think of AGG as of a rendering engine that
produces pixel images in memory from some vectorial data. But of course, AGG can
do much more than that. The ideas and the philosophy of AGG are:

  * Anti-Aliasing.
  * Subpixel Accuracy.
  * The highest possible quality.
  * High performance.
  * Platform independence and compatibility.
  * Flexibility and extensibility.
  * Lightweight design.
  * Reliability and stability (including numerical stability).
