Little CMS intends to be a small-footprint color management library, with
special focus on accuracy and performance.  It uses the International Color
Consortium standard (ICC), and offers fast transformation routines between
ICC profiles.

Color management refers to techniques that ensure consistent colors while
images are transferred from scanners or cameras to monitors and printers.
