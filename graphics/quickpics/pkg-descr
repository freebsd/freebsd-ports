QuickPics is a unix-based application that creates an HTML web gallery
based on the directory structure and the images therein.  All thumbnails
are created by the program using direct calls to the jpeg library for
fast thumbnail creation.  One of my main requirements is that it will not
not have to rely on CGI access to run.  It also does not need require
Perl or other jpeg libraries.  Only the executable 'qp' is needed to
create any gallery of any size.

If you have an image gallery and you are tired of editing all the HTML
pages and resizing thumbnails, try QuickPics.
