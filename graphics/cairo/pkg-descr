Cairo is a vector graphics library with cross-device output
support. Currently supported output targets include the X Window
System and in-memory image buffers. PostScript and PDF file output is
planned. Cairo is designed to produce identical output on all output
media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when
available (eg. through the X Render Extension).

Cairo provides a stateful user-level API with capabilities similar to
the PDF 1.4 imaging model. Cairo provides operations including stroking
and filling Bezier cubic splines, transforming and compositing translucent
images, and antialiased text rendering.
