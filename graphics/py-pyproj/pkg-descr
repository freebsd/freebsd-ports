Cython wrapper to provide python interfaces to PROJ.4 functions.

Performs cartographic transformations and geodetic computations.

The Proj class can convert from geographic (longitude,latitude)
to native map projection (x,y) coordinates and vice versa, or
from one map projection coordinate system directly to another. 
The module variable pj_list is a dictionary containing all the
available projections and their descriptions.

The Geod class can perform forward and inverse geodetic, or
Great Circle, computations. The forward computation involves
determining latitude, longitude and back azimuth of a terminus
point given the latitude and longitude of an initial point,
plus azimuth and distance. The inverse computation involves
determining the forward and back azimuths and distance given
the latitudes and longitudes of an initial and terminus point.

Input coordinates can be given as python arrays, lists/tuples,
scalars or numpy/Numeric/numarray arrays. Optimized for objects
that support the Python buffer protocol (regular python and
numpy array objects).
