This is gpaint, a small-scale painting program for GNOME, the GNU Desktop. 
Gpaint does not attempt to compete with GIMP.  Think of GIMP is like Photoshop as
gpaint is like Windows Paint.

Gpaint is still work in progress and many features are still being developed. 
However, gpaint is useable already for small image markups.

A large part of gpaint is derived from xpaint 2.4.9, authored by David Koblas
and later Torsten Martinsen.  Gpaint also uses the gtkscrolframe widget (taking
from eog 0.5) by Federco Mena-Quintero.

Future plans include the implementation of missing features, printing support,
and turning gpaint into a Bonobo component for simple image editing tasks.
