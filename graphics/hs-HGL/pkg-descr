A simple graphics library, designed to give the programmer access to most
interesting parts of the Win32 Graphics Device Interface and X11 library
without exposing the programmer to the pain and anguish usually associated with
using these interfaces.

The library also includes a module Graphics.SOE providing the interface used
in "The Haskell School of Expression", by Paul Hudak,
