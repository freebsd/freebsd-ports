This little program will take an Autodesk Flic (FLI/FLC) file and convert
all of its frames into sequential images in a GIF89a file, along with a
Netscape application extension animation chunk.  This allows you to easily
create animated GIF's that are viewable by Netscape Navigator 2 and
Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 (and above) users.

By using my program, you can use any animation program that can output
Autodesk Flic files.  This includes Autodesk Animator, Autodesk Animator
Pro, Autodesk 3D-Studio, and many others.  Additionally, there exist
utilities to convert from nearly any other animation format into the
flic format, allowing even more possibilities of animation conversion
without having to resort to saving out individual frames to separate files.
