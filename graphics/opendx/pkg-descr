   Data Explorer brings together dynamic computational
   and rendering tools in a dynamic, programmable framework that enables
   users to rapidly create visualizations of highly complex data from
   disparate sources.

   Data Explorer can be used to add visualization capabilities to
   existing applications. It is used by companies and institutions for
   applications in a large variety of visualization fields including
   computational fluid dynamics, medical imagery, computational
   chemistry, and engineering analysis. For example, it is currently
   being used to:

     * Identify and manage portfolio risk worldwide for a large
       multinational banking group.
     * Depict oil-flow simulations to improve drilling success-rates and
       increase reservoir yields.
     * Piece together over 5,000 ceiling fragments from a 1,200-year-old
       temple in Peru.
     * Help insurance agents identify opportunities to cross-sell product
       offerings.
     * Visualize developing weather patterns to improve the accuracy of
       weather forecasts.
