Graphite is a project under development within SIL'ss Non-Roman Script
Initiative and Language Software Development groups to provide rendering
capabilities for complex non-Roman writing systems.  The original goal was a
system for the Windows platform; the system has also been ported to Linux.
Graphite can be used to create "smart fonts" capable of displaying writing
systems with various complex behaviors.  With respect to the Text Encoding
Model, Graphite handles the "Rendering" aspect of writing system implementation.
