Matplot++ is a graphics library for data visualization that provides
interactive plotting, means for exporting plots in high-quality
formats for scientific publications, a compact syntax consistent with
similar libraries, dozens of plot categories with specialized
algorithms, multiple coding styles, and supports generic backends.

Matplot++ renders graphics using gnuplot and shows graphics in
gnuplot standalone windows.
