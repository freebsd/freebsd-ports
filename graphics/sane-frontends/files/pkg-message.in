Congratulations, SANE-FRONTENDS is now installed.

If you built it with WITH_GIMP set to yes, you can use
xscanimage as a GIMP plug-in.  To do this, type:

ln -sf %%PREFIX%%/bin/xscanimage ~/.gimp-2.0/plug-ins/xscanimage (gimp-2.x)

Then run the GIMP, and a new "xscanimage" menu item should appear in the
"File->Acquire" menu.  Use this to access your scanner.

Have fun!
