Fiona is designed to be simple and dependable. It focuses on reading and 
writing data in standard Python IO style and relies upon familiar Python 
types and protocols such as files, dictionaries, mappings, and iterators 
instead of classes specific to OGR. Fiona can read and write real-world 
data using multi-layered GIS formats and zipped virtual file systems and 
integrates readily with other Python GIS packages such as pyproj, Rtree, 
and Shapely. Fiona is supported only on CPython versions 2.7 and 3.4+.
