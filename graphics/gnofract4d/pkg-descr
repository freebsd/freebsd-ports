Gnofract 4D is a free, open source program which allows anyone to create
beautiful images called fractals. The images are automatically created by
the computer based on mathematical principles. These include the Mandelbrot
and Julia sets and many more. You don't need to do any math: you can explore
a universe of images just using a mouse.
