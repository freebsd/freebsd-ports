Wayland is intended as a simpler replacement for X, easier to develop and
maintain. GNOME and KDE are expected to be ported to it.

Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well as
a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be a
standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev
input devices, an X application, or a wayland client itself. The clients can
be traditional applications, X servers (rootless or fullscreen) or other
display servers.
