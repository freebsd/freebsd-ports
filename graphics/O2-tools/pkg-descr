Huge image processing tools and libraries.

  Most of the programs in this package were designed carefully to
  avoid slowing down even for huge images, e.g. 3300x4700.  I hope
  you will find them better.

  This package contains following programs:
    bmptopnm-O2 (bmptopnm in original distribution)
             - convert a BMP(DIB) file into a portable anymap
    breduce  - read a portable bitmap and reduce it N times
    makecr   - create circumscribing rectangles (bounding box) in an
               image
    makepr   - create Primitive Rectangles in an image
    prlst2ps - produce  PostScript  data  from  rectangle/line-
               segment data
    lpsmooth - smooth an image preserving thin lines
