Quesa is a high level 3D graphics library, released as Open Source under
the LGPL, which offers binary and source level compatibility with Apple's
QuickDraw(TM) 3D API. Quesa does not contain any Apple source code, and was
developed without access to Apple's QD3D implementation.

QD3D supports both retained and immediate mode rendering, an extensible file
format, plug-in renderers, a wide range of high level geometries, hierarchical
models, and a consistent and object-orientated API.
