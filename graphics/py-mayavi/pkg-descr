3D Scientific Data Visualization and Plotting 

The Mayavi project includes two related packages for 3-dimensional
visualization:
  Mayavi: A tool for easy and interactive visualization of data, with
          seamless integration with Python scientific libraries.
  TVTK:   A Traits-based wrapper for the Visualization Toolkit, a popular
          open-source visualization library.

These libraries operate at different levels of abstraction. TVTK
manipulates visualization objects, while Mayavi lets you operate
on your data, and then see the results. Most users either use the
Mayavi user interface or program to its scripting interface; you
probably don't need to interact with TVTK unless you want to create
a new Mayavi module.
