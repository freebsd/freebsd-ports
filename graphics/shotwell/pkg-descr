Shotwell is an image organizer designed to provide personal photo management
for the GNOME desktop environment.

Shotwell can import photos and videos from a digital camera directly, group
photos and videos automatically by date, and supports tagging.  Its image
editing features allow users to straighten, crop, eliminate red eye, and
adjust levels and color balance.  It also features an auto "enhance" option
that will attempt to guess appropriate levels for the image.

Shotwell allows users to publish their images and videos to Facebook, Flickr,
Picasa Web Albums, Piwigo, and YouTube.
