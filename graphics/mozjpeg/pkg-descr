Mozilla JPEG Encoder Project

MozJPEG reduces file sizes of JPEG images while retaining quality and
compatibility with the vast majority of the world's deployed decoders.

MozJPEG is based on libjpeg-turbo. It's compatible with libjpeg API and ABI, and
can be used as a drop-in replacement for libjpeg. MozJPEG makes tradeoffs that
are intended to benefit Web use cases and focuses solely on improving encoding,
so it's best used as part of a Web encoding workflow.

MozJPEG is meant to be used as a library in graphics programs and image
processing tools. We include a demo cjpeg tool, but it's not intended for
serious use. We encourage authors of graphics programs to use MozJPEG's C API
instead.
