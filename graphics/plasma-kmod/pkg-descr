plasma is a FreeBSD kernel module screensaver which displays a moving
plasma effect. You are advised that the code is quite resource-greedy
and that you probably don't want to run it on anything but a desktop
workstation. It's a quick hack, so comments/constructive criticism is
appreciated. MAINTAINER is the author of this port.
