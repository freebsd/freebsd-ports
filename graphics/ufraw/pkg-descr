The Unidentified Flying Raw (UFRaw) is a utility to read and manipulate
raw images from digital cameras. It can be used on its own or as a Gimp
plug-in. It reads raw images using Dave Coffin's raw conversion utility
- DCRaw. UFRaw supports basic color management using Little CMS,
allowing the user to apply color profiles. For Nikon users UFRaw has the
advantage that it can read the camera's tone curves. Even if you don't
own a Nikon, you can still apply a Nikon curve to your images.
