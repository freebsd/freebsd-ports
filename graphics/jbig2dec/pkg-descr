jbig2dec is a decoder implementation of the JBIG2 image compression format.
JBIG2 is designed for lossy or lossless encoding of 'bilevel' (1-bit monochrome)
images at moderately high resolution, and in particular scanned paper documents.
In this domain it is very efficient, offering compression ratios on the order of
100:1.
