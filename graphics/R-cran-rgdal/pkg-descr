Provides bindings to Frank Warmerdam's Geospatial Data Abstraction
Library (GDAL) (>= 1.6.3) and access to projection/transformation
operations from the PROJ.4 library. The GDAL and PROJ.4 libraries
are external to the package, and, when installing the package from
source, must be correctly installed first. Both GDAL raster and OGR
vector map data can be imported into R, and GDAL raster data and
OGR vector data exported. Use is made of classes defined in the sp
package.
