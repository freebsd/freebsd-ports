Provides a perl interface to tesseract.

This is just an interface to make it quick an easy to get ocr output from an
image file. No matter what image type you provide, imagemagick convert is
called to turn it into the format for tesseract

Also accepts any image input- takes care of converting your imput image to a
tiff to the required specs, without changing the original.

Example usage:

ocr ./image.jpg > ./savetext.txt
ocr ./image.png
ocr ./image1.jpg ./image2.jpg > ./alltext.txt
ocr ./image*jpg
