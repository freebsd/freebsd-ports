The DIPlib project contains:
* DIPlib, a C++ library for quantitative image analysis. It has been in
  development at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands since 1995.
  The 3.0 release of DIPlib represented a complete rewrite in modern C++ of the
  library infrastructure, with most of the image processing and analysis
  algorithms ported from the previous version, and some of them improved
  significantly.
* DIPimage, a MATLAB toolbox for quantitative image analysis. It has been in
  development at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands since 1999.
* PyDIP, Python bindings to DIPlib. This is currently a thin wrapper that
  exposes the C++ functionality with little change.
* DIPviewer, an interactive image display utility. It is usable from C++, Python
  and MATLAB programs. Within DIPimage this is an optional alternative to the
  default MATLAB-native interactive display utility.
* DIPjavaio, an interface to OME Bio-Formats, a Java-based library that reads
  hundreds of image file formats. This module is usable from C++ and Python
  (DIPimage interfaces to Bio-Formats natively).
