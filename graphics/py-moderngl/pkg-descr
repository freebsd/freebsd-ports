ModernGL is a python wrapper over OpenGL 3.3+ core that simplifies the creation
of simple graphics applications like scientific simulations, games or user
interfaces. Usually, acquiring in-depth knowledge of OpenGL requires a steep
learning curve. In contrast, ModernGL is easy to learn and use, moreover it is
capable of rendering with high performance and quality, with less code written.
The majority of the moderngl code base is also written in C++ for high
performance.
