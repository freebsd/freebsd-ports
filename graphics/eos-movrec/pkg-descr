This program writes short movies with your Canon DSLR camera directly to the
computer.  The camera must have Live View feature to work; supported models
include Canon EOS 450D, Canon EOS 1000D, Canon 40D, Canon 50D, Canon 5D Mark
II, Canon 1Ds Mark III.  The program offers preview, Av, Tv, and WB control.
While some newer models provide video recording natively, this program can
be useful if your camera does not have this option.

Video will be recorded using MJPEG codec, with no sound, roughly at 22 FPS
(depends on your hardware: camera and computer).  Image size is also camera
dependent: 848x560 for 450D; 1024x680 for 40D, 50D, and top models; 768x512
for 1000D.  Resulting file is simply a collection of Live View frames stored
sequentially without any compression in AVI container (expect file size to
be quite large).
