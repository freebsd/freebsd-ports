resvg is an SVG rendering library.

It can be used as a Rust library, as a C library, and as a CLI
application to render static SVG files.

The core idea is to make a fast, small, portable SVG library with the goal to
support the whole SVG spec.

Features:
* Designed for edge-cases
* Safety
* Zero bloat
* Portable
* SVG preprocessing
* Performance
* Reproducibility
