This is a port of GraphicsMagick(TM), the "swiss army knife" of image
processing. It provides a robust collection of tools and libraries which
support reading, writing, and manipulating an image in over 88 major
formats including formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, SVG
and TIFF.

The program is the fork of a better-known ImageMagick (5.5.2), which
emphasizes end-user and API-stabilities.
