GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing. Comprised of 267K
physical lines (according to David A. Wheeler's SLOCCount) of source code in the
base package (or 1,225K including 3rd party libraries) it provides a robust and
efficient collection of tools and libraries which support reading, writing, and
manipulating an image in over 88 major formats including important formats like
DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and TIFF.

GraphicsMagick supports huge images and has been tested with gigapixel-size
images. GraphicsMagick can create new images on the fly, making it suitable for
building dynamic Web applications. GraphicsMagick may be used to resize, rotate,
sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to an image and save the result in
the same or different image format. Image processing operations are available
from the command line, as well as through C, C++, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl,
Ruby, Windows .NET, or Windows COM programming interfaces. With some
modification, language extensions for ImageMagick may be used.
