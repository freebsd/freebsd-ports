Tiny SVG fremebuffer abstraction library, written in C.

The overall idea of the library is to take some SVG as input, and return
a list of paths and texts which can be rendered easily. The library does
not do the actual rendering.

All supported SVG objects, for example circles, lines, and gradient
filled shapes, are converted to flat-filled paths or a fragment of text,
and all coordinates are converted, transformed etc. to pixels.
