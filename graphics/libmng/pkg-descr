The libmng library supports decoding, displaying, encoding, and various other
manipulations of Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) format image files.  It
uses the zlib(3) compression library, and optionally the JPEG library by the
Independant JPEG Group (IJG) and/or lcms (little CMS), a color-management
library by Marti Maria Saguar.
