This subclass of Convert::Color::RGB8 provides lookup of the colors that xterm
uses by default. Note that the module is not intelligent enough to actually
parse the XTerm configuration on a machine, nor to query a running terminal for
its actual colors. It simply implements the colors that are present as defaults
in the XTerm source code.

It implements the complete 256-color model in XTerm.
