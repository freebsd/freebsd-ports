ODS, the Open Digita Services project, is an effort to write Open Source tools
for accessing Digita cameras from Linux and other unix operating systems.

ODS has been tested with and is known to work with the following cameras:

Kodak DC-220
Kodak DC-260
Kodak DC-265
Kodak DC-290

The Minolta EX-1500 has been reported to work with ODS, but the interface needs
some debugging.

ODS will not support cameras that don't use Digita; this includes the Kodak
DC-200, DC-210, DC-240, DC-280, and earlier cameras.
