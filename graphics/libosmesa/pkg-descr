Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that
of OpenGL*.  To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command syntax or
state machine, it is being used with authorization from Silicon Graphics,
Inc.  However, the author makes no claim that Mesa is in any way a
compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with Silicon Graphics, Inc.

This is a Off-Screen version of Mesa in order to do off-screen rendering in
other packages like VTK. Offscreen rendering is useful for a
number of things, such as batch processing, parallel processing, and
remote processing.
