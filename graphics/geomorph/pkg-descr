Geomorph is a height field generator and editor for the Linux
operating system.

A height field is a kind of topographic map.  It is a 2D projection
of a 3D landscape.

Geomorph generates square images and shows a 3D preview of the
resulting landscape.  The resulting 2D image can be processed with
a tool like Povray for rendering the landscape.
