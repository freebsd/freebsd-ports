ImageMagick is an X11 package for display and interactive manipulation
of images.  The package includes tools for image conversion,
annotation, compositing, animation, and creating montages.  ImageMagick
can read and write many of the more popular image formats (e.g. JPEG,
TIFF, PNM, XPM, Photo CD, etc.).
