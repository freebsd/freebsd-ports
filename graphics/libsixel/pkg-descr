This package provides encoder/decoder implementation for DEC SIXEL graphics,
and some converter programs.
SIXEL is one of image formats for terminal imaging introduced by DEC VT series.
Its data scheme is represented as a terminal-friendly escape sequence.
So if you want to view a SIXEL image file, all you have to do is "cat" it to
your terminal.
