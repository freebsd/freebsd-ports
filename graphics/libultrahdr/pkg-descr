libultrahdr is an image compression library that uses gain map technology to
store and distribute HDR images. Conceptually on the encoding side, the library
accepts SDR and HDR rendition of an image and from these a Gain Map (quotient
between the two renditions) is computed. The library then uses backward
compatible means to store the base image (SDR), gain map image and some
associated metadata. Legacy readers that do not support handling the gain map
image and/or metadata, will display the base image. Readers that support the
format combine the base image with the gain map and render a high dynamic range
image on compatible displays.
