vid is a Image Capture program for USB cameras using the
Omnivision OV511 and OV511+ chipset.


These include the

  Creative Labs WebCam 3 (*** see note about the OV511+ below ***)
  D-Link DSB-C300 
  Puretek PT-6007 
  Alpha Vision Koala-Cam 
  Lifeview RoboCam 
  AverMedia InterCam Elite 
  MediaForte MV300 
  Trust SpaceCam 300 (*** see note about the OV511+ below ***)

The program was written by Peter Housel <housel@acm.org) and
is heavily based on the Linux OV511 driver from http://alpha.dyndns.org/ov511/

Notes On The OV511+
-------------------
Josh Elsasser <jre@vineyard.net> has added support for OV511+ cameras.
Older Creative WebCam 3's use the OV511 but newer ones use the OV511+

On my OV511+ Trust SpaceCam 300 the image appears orange. I'm investigating.
