The NVIDIA Texture Tools is a collection of image processing and
texture manipulation tools, designed to be integrated in game tools
and asset conditioning pipelines.

The primary features of the library are mipmap and normal map
generation, format conversion and DXT compression.

DXT compression is based on Simon Brown's squish library. The library
also contains an alternative GPU-accelerated compressor that uses
CUDA and is one order of magnitude faster.
