Metaport for different versions of Linux DRM based on the FreeBSD version
in use. This port encompasses the recommendations of the FreeBSDDesktop team
of DRM versions for FreeBSD versions based on the last update to the LinuxKPI
in that code base. In general, the most recent supported stable DRM for a give
FreeBSD version will be installed. CURRENT receives the most recent development
DRM.

continue to install DRM ports directly.
