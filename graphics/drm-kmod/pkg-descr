Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) modules for LinuxKPI-based kernel mode setting
(KMS) components. Modules for amdgpu, i915, and radeon (based on amd64, i915
and radeonkms modules from the former base DRM component on other
architectures). This metaport encompasses recommended versions of DRM, based
on the most recent updates to the LinuxKPI in specific versions of FreeBSD.
Generally, the main branch (CURRENT) receives the most recent development DRM.

Installing this metaport will:

* additionally, install the port of the most recent supported stable modules
  for the running version of FreeBSD

* not hinder expert approaches such as direct installation of DRM ports.
