zgv is an svgalib-based viewer which views GIF, JPEG, PNG,
PBM/PGM/PPM, TIFF, BMP, TGA, PCX, mrf, XBM, and XPM files, with a
full-screen file selector front-end. It can be used as a simple
command, with zgv filename(s), which bypasses the front-end. For
more on how zgv works and how to use it, do `info zgv' or `man zgv'
once it's installed.
