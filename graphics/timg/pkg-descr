timg - Terminal Image Viewer

A viewer that uses 24-Bit color capabilities and unicode
character blocks to display images in the terminal.
Displays regular images, plays animated gifs or allows to
scroll static images.

Very useful for if you want to have a quick visual check
without starting a bulky image viewer or in an SSH session.
