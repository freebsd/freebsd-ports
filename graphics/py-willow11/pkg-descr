Willow is a simple image library that combines the APIs of Pillow, Wand and
OpenCV. It converts the image between the libraries when necessary.

Willow currently has basic resize and crop operations, face and feature
detection and animated GIF support. New operations and library integrations can
also be easily implemented.

It is written in pure-Python.
