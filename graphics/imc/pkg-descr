imc, the Image Compiler

General features

Generally, the most important features are the following:
   - Does not need a display to run.
   - Can be run from the command line or as CGI script. In the latter case,
     the image is output to the browser (in PNG or JPEG format).
   - The size of the output image is automatically determined, no size has to
     be specified (although you can give a fixed size)
   - Coordinates are in pixels, only positive coordinates are visible. Angles
     are in integer degrees, no limitations (except the maximum integer limit).
     Colors can be specified in one of three formats, including X11 color
     (rgb) strings
   - A pre-processor can be applied on the input file first; simple arithmetic
     can be performed.
   - Supports commands for drawing lines, circles (filled or not), rectangles
     (filled or not), ellipses (filled or not), arcs and text. Images can also
     be imported. For text and images an alignment parameter is available, and
     text and images can be rotated over any angle and can also be mirrored.
