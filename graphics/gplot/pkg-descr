GPLOT is a graphics utility program, designed for the processing of CGM
metafiles produced by DI3000, DISSPLA, DRAWCGM and NCARGKS.  Source code
for GPLOT is avilable to other sites, so that graphics created at
PSC can be processed locally.

Note that the current version of GPLOT is able to recognize NCAR CGM
metafiles created on the Cray, and automatically carry out the byte-swapping 
necessary to properly interpret such files.  In other words, you should no 
longer have to worry about running the NCARFIX program on your file before
using GPLOT.

Graphics images produced by GPLOT can be combined with TEX formatted
text by the GTEX program.  See PSCDOC:GTEX.DOC and TEX.DOC.
 
To report problems with GPLOT, or to request new output capabilities,
