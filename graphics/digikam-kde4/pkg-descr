DigiKam is an advanced digital photo management application for KDE,
which makes importing and organizing digital photos a "snap".
The photos are organized in albums which can be sorted chronologically,
by folder layout or by custom collections.

An easy-to-use interface is provided that enables you to connect
to your camera and preview, download and/or delete your images.
Basic auto-transformations can be deployed on the fly during
image downloading.

Digikam also uses the very flexible Kipi plugin architecture.
Install the graphics/kipi-plugins-kde4 port to extend Digikam's features.
