QtAwesome is a simple library that can be used to add Font Awesome
icons to your Qt application.

NOTE: Though the name is QtAwesome and currently it's very Font
Awesome based, you can use every other icon/glyph font you want.

The class can also be used to manage your own dynamic code-drawn
icons, by adding named icon-painters.
