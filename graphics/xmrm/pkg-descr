From the manual...

XMRM is an image morphing program written for XWindows. A special feature
of this program, which is not found in other morphing packages, is the
ability to control the morphing speed of details in relation to the
morphing speed of big features.

xmrm supports all Direct-Color-modes (Hi-Color, Real-Color: 15bpp,16bpp
and True-Color: 24bpp,32bpp), but it doesn't run with any Color-
LookUpTable-mode (8bpp modes) !
