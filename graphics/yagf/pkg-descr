YAGF is a graphical interface for the cuneiform text recognition
program on the Linux platform. With YAGF you can scan images via
XSane, perform images preprocessing and recognize texts using
cuneiform from a single command centre. YAGF also makes it easy to
scan and recognize several images sequentially.
