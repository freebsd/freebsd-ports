These icons were converted from the Hobbes OS/2 archive at hobbes.nmsu.edu.

There were over 7000 icons on Hobbes, but many were duplicates.
All duplicates (based on comparing CRC's) have been removed, a suffix of .N
was added when there were name clashes, and any icons with 256 colors were
also deleted.  What remained became 3,382 icons which are mostly 32x32
and 16 colors.
