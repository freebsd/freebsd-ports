Now you have to install some themes from http://www.travisemslander.com/gdancer/themes.php
into .xmms/gdancer_themes/<name_of_theme>. If it does not exist in your home
directory, just create it.

You HAVE to install the default theme (space_ghost), else you won't be able
to change the config to another dancer.
