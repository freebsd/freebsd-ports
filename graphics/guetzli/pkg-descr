Guetzli is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density
at high visual quality.  Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30%
smaller than images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg.
Guetzli generates only sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to faster
decompression speeds they offer.
