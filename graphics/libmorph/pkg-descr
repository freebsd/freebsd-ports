The main purpose of LibMorph is loading (and saving) 3d models (3d modeller
object files). Given loader is dynamically linked when format of requested file
is recognized.

The library is very young piece of software, so chances are high that some
things don't work yet as they should or at all. If you have need for some
particular feature, drop me a mail, I'll try to reprioritize my TODO list.

LibMorph currently supports following formats (only loading at the moment):
        LWOB    -- LightWave[TM],
        3DS     -- 3D Studio[TM],

In future hopefully it'll support:
        ?       -- Alias Wavefront[TM]
        MAX     -- 3D Studio Max[TM]
        DXF     -- CAD?
        ?       -- Maya[TM]
        ?       -- Soft Image[TM]
        SVG     -- XML, 2d Vector files converted to 3d (via libart?)
        and more
