DESCRIPTION
	gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
	complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
	other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a .GIF file.
	This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where .GIF
	is the format used for inline images. 

	gd is not a paint program. If you are looking for a paint program, try 
	xpaint by David Koblas, available by anonymous FTP from ftp.netcom.com
	in pub/ko/koblas. (That package is for the X Window System; for the Mac
	and the PC, paint programs are considerably easier to find.) 

	gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics operation. It
	is not necessary or desirable for gd to become a kitchen-sink graphics
	package, but version 1.2 incorporates most of the commonly requested 
	features for a 2D package.

	gd 1.2 was written by Thomas Boutell and is currently distributed by
