DESCRIPTION

	gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
	complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
	other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a .PNG file.
	This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where .PNG
	is the format used for inline images. 

	gd is not a paint program. If you are looking for a paint program, you
	are looking in the wrong place. If you are not a programmer, you are
	looking in the wrong place.

	gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics operation.
	It is not necessary or desirable for gd to become a kitchen-sink
	graphics package, but version 1.7.3 incorporates most of the commonly
	requested features for an 8-bit 2D package. Support for truecolor
	images, JPEG and truecolor PNG is planned for version 2.0.
