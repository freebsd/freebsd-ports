Port of the new 'matplotlib' color maps ('viridis' - the default -,
'magma', 'plasma' and 'inferno') to 'R'. 'matplotlib'
<http://matplotlib.org/> is a popular plotting library for 'python'.
These color maps are designed in such a way that they will analytically
be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also
when converted to black-and-white. They are also designed to be
perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness.
