"Jpegpixi" is short for "JPEG pixel interpolator". The intent of
the program is to interpolate pixels in JFIF images (commonly refered
to as "JPEG images"). This is useful to correct images from a digital
camera with CCD defects. For example, if one pixel is always bright
green, this pixel can be interpolated away with jpegpixi.

Jpegpixi is unique in that it tries to preserve the quality of the
JFIF image as much as possible. Usual graphics programs decode JFIF
images when they are loaded, and re-encode them when they are saved,
which results in an overall loss of quality. Jpegpixi, on the other
hand, does not decode and re-encode the image, but manipulates the
encoded image data (known as the "DCT coefficients"). Therefore,
the blocks (typically 8x8, 8x16, or 16x16 pixel areas) which contain
the pixels to be interpolated are minimally disturbed, and other
blocks remain pixel-by-pixel identical to the original image.
