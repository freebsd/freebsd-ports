Truevision is a 3D modeler for Gnome. It is still in development, so not
really stable and quite not usable yet.

Feature :
   - create some objects :
       - finite solid primitives : box, sphere, cone, cylinder, torus,
         heightfield, superellipsoid
       - finite patch primitive : disc
       - infinite solid primitive : plane
       - lights : point, cylindrical, spot, area
       - csg operators : union, merge, intersection, difference
       - atmospherics : background, skysphere, media, fog
   - manipulate them ( rotate, scale, translate ... )
   - manipulate and edit the camera.
   - render the scene with the multithreaded povray frontend.
   - create and edit materials ( except slope maps ), with preview in editor.
   - output the scene to povray.
   - save and load scenes, objects, materials.
   - save materials with preview in material library.
