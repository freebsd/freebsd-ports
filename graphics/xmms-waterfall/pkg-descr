Waterfall is yet another XMMS spectrum analyzer. While most analyzers only
show a changing snapshot of the current sound, waterfall shows a scrolling
spectrogram, a 2-d plot of frequency vs time, with energy represented by
intensity. There are also options to use color to display stereo
discrepancies, frequency onsets, or frequency uniformity.
