Image::Base::SVG extends Image::Base to create or update SVG format image files
using the SVG.pm module (see SVG::Manual).

Image::Base is pixel oriented so isn't really the sort of thing SVG is meant
for, but this module can direct some Image::Base style code at an SVG object. Of
course the SVG module has many more features if used natively.

It's often fairly easy to spit out SVG directly too, and for instance the
Image::Base::SVGout module can do that. The advantages of the SVG document
object model comes when combining images or fragments, or going through elements
for post-facto mangling.

In the current code the SVG elements emitted assume some default style
attributes such as stroke-width 1. Perhaps that should be set explicitly on each
element.
