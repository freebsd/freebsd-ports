* IlmImfCtl provides a simplified OpenEXR interface to CTL.

* exrdpx is an initial version of a CTL-driven file converter
  that translates DPX files into OpenEXR files and vice versa.
  The conversion between the DPX and OpenEXR color spaces is
  handled by CTL transforms.

* exr_ctl_exr is an initial version of a program that can bake
  the effect of a series of CTL transforms into the pixels of
  an OpenEXR file.

WARNING: the exrdpx file converter and the exr_ctl_exr program are
still under development.  They are good enough for experimentation,
but they are not ready for production use.  The programs are slow,
and the DPX file I/O capabilities of exrdpx are minimal; most DPX
header fields and most OpenEXR attributes are lost during file
conversion.
