The libgrass package consists of the majority of the libgis, and
libdatetime library functions from the GRASS GIS program.  They are
built as a standalone shared library suitable for use by non-GRASS
applications wishing to read and write GRASS databases. Some
additional functions have been added to simplify library
initialization and data access by non-GRASS applications.  

While libgrass is currently only suitable for accessing GRASS raster
cells, and associated support files, it is hoped that future
revisions will include support for vector files, and other data
elements stored within the GRASS database.
