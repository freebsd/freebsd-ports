Raster3D is a set of tools for generating high quality raster images of
proteins or other molecules.

The core program renders spheres, triangles, cylinders, and quadric
surfaces with specular highlighting, Phong shading, and shadowing. It
uses an efficient software Z-buffer algorithm which is independent of
any graphics hardware.

Ancillary programs process atomic coordinates from PDB files into
rendering descriptions for pictures composed of ribbons, space-filling
atoms, bonds, ball+stick, etc.

Raster3D can also be used to render pictures composed in other programs
such as Molscript in glorious 3D with highlights, shadowing, etc. Output
is to pixel image files with 24 bits of color information per pixel.
