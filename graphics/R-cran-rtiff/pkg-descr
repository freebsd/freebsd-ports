This package will read and write TIFF format images and return them
as a pixmap object. Because the resulting object can be very large
for even modestly sized TIFF images, images can be reduced as they
are read for improved performance. This package is a wrapper around
libtiff (www.libtiff.org), on which it depends (i.e. the libtiff
shared library must be on your PATH for the binary to work, and
tiffio.h must be on your system to build the package from source).
By using libtiff's highlevel TIFFReadRGBAImage function, this package
inherently support a wide range of image formats and compression
schemes. This package also provides an implementation of the Ridler
Autothresholding algorithm for easy generation of binary masks.
