The primary goal of xiccd is providing color profile support for desktop
environments other than Gnome and KDE (Xfce, LXDE, and probably others)
that don't support native color management yet.

It does basically the same as the "gnome-settings-daemon" color plugin or
"colord-kde" but doesn't depend on any particular desktop. It doesn't even
depend on GTK so it doesn't create a unnecessary GTK3 dependency if the
desktop environment is GTK2-based or vice versa.
