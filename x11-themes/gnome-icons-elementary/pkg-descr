It all started with a little blue folder and about five other icons for
Object-Dock. Today, elementary icons is one of the most beautiful,
professional, and popular tango-styled icon sets on Gnome-Look,
it has won editor's choice on UpToDown.com,
inspired many new works such as the popular gnome-colors and new-wave
themes, and has even been proposed and implemented as the default look
for quite a few Linux distributions including Freezy Linux and
Frugalware Linux.
