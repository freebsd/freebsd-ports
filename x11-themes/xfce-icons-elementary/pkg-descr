An icon-theme maintained with Xfce in mind, but it supports other desktops
like Gnome3 as well. It's a fork of the upstream elementary-project, which
took place because the team decided to drop a lot of desktop-specific
symlinks. This icon-theme is supposed to keep everything working, but still
pull new icons from upstream and integrate them occasionally.
