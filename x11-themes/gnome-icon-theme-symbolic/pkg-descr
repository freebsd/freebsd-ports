Purpose of this icon theme is to extend the base icon theme that follows the
Tango style guidelines for specific purposes. This would include OSD messages,
panel system/notification area, and possibly menu icons.

Icons follow the naming specification, but have a -symbolic suffix, so only
applications specifically looking up these symbolic icons will render them. If
a -symbolic icon is missing, the app will fall back to the regular name.
