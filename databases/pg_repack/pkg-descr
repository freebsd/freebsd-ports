Pg_repack is a PostgreSQL extension which lets you remove bloat from tables and
indexes, and optionally restore the physical order of clustered indexes. Unlike
CLUSTER and VACUUM FULL it works online, without holding an exclusive lock on
the processed tables during processing. pg_repack is efficient to boot, with
performance comparable to using CLUSTER directly.
