MariaDB respects hier(7) and doesn't check /etc and /etc/mysql for
my.cnf. Please move existing my.cnf files from those paths to
%%PREFIX%%/etc/mysql or %%PREFIX%%/etc. Sample
configuration files are provided in %%PREFIX%%/etc/mysql
and %%PREFIX%%/etc/mysql/conf.d.
The rc(8) script no longer uses /var/db/mysql/my.cnf for configuration
nor /var/db/mysql for logs and PID-file.

This port does NOT include the mytop perl script, this is included in
the MariaDB tarball but the most recent version can be found in the
databases/mytop port

%%WSREP%%Using wsrep clustering requires adding a configuration file.

%%WSREP%%%%PREFIX%%/etc/mysql/conf.d/wsrep.conf and change what you need there.
