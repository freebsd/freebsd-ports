Class::DBI::Plugin is an abstract base class for Class::DBI plugins.
Its purpose is to make writing plugins easier. Writers of plugins
should be able to concentrate on the functionality their module
provides, instead of having to deal with the symbol table hackery
involved when writing a plugin module.
