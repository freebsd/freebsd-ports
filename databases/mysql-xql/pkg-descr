The lib_mysqludf_xql library provides an array of functions,
which can be used to create XML output directly from MySQL
using a single SQL query. This prevents having to convert a
MySQL result to XML in a PHP script, Ruby script, etc.

The library provides the same functionality as SQL/XML, seen
in MS SQL server and Oracle. However it uses normal functions.
By using subqueries the same results as SQL/XML can be generated.
