Remember to run mysql_upgrade the first time you start the MySQL server
after an upgrade from an earlier version.

There is no initial password for first time use of MySQL.
Keep in mind to reset it to a secure password.

MySQL80 has a default %%ETCDIR%%/my.cnf,
remember to replace it with your own
or set `mysql_optfile="$YOUR_CNF_FILE` in rc.conf.
