AnyEvent::BDB is an AnyEvent user, you need to make sure that you use and run a
supported event loop.

Loading this module will install the necessary magic to seamlessly integrate BDB
into AnyEvent, i.e. you no longer need to concern yourself with calling
BDB::poll_cb or any of that stuff (you still can, but this module will do it in
case you don't).

The AnyEvent watcher can be disabled by executing undef $AnyEvent::BDB::WATCHER.
Please notify the author of when and why you think this was necessary.
