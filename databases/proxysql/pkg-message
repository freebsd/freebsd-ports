proxysql requires fdescfs mounted.

If you have not yet enabled it, please do the following:

        mount -t fdescfs fdesc /dev/fd

To make this change persist through reboots, you must edit /etc/fstab:

        fdesc   /dev/fd         fdescfs         rw      0       0

In order for logging to function, you must restart syslogd:

# service syslogd restart
EOM
}
