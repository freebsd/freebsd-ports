GigaBASE: Object-Relational Database Management System

GigaBASE inherits most of the features of FastDB, but uses page pool instead
of direct mapping of file on virtual memory. So GigaBASE is able to handle
database, which size significantly exceeds size of computer physical memory.
Convenient and flexible C++ interface makes development of application for
GigaBASE very easy and automatic scheme evaluation simplifies maintenance
and modification of the system. GigaBASE merges best features of relational
(simple data structure and non-procedural query language) and object-oriented
(direct object references, user defined types and methods) databases.
GigaBASE is primary oriented on application requiring fast data retrieving
by means of indices and direct object references, such as Web Server databases
applications.

SUBSQL utility can be used for database browsing and inspection, performing
online backups, database recovery, importing data to and exporting data from
database. GigaBASE will perform automatic recovery after system or application
crash, you should not worry about it. The only thing you can have to do manually
is stopping all database application if one of them is crashed leaving database
blocked.
