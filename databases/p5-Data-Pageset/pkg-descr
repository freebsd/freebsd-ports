navigation, it inherits from Data::Page and has access to all methods from
this object.

In addition it also provides methods for dealing with set of pages, so
that if there are too many pages you can easily break them into chunks for
the user to browse through.

You can even choose to view page numbers in your set in a 'sliding'
fassion.

The object can easily be passed to a templating system such as Template
Toolkit or be used within a script.
