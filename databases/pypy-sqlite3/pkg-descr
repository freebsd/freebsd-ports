SQLite is a library that provides a SQL-language database that
stores data in disk files without requiring a separate server
process. pysqlite provides a SQL interface compliant with the DB-API
2.0 specification described by PEP 249. This means that it should
be possible to write the first version of your applications using
SQLite for data storage. If switching to a larger database such as
PostgreSQL or Oracle is later necessary, the switch should be
relatively easy.
