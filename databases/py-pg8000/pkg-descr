pg8000 is a Pure-Python interface to the PostgreSQL database
engine. It is one of many PostgreSQL interfaces for the Python
programming language. pg8000 is somewhat distinctive in that
it is written entirely in Python and does not rely on any
external libraries (such as a compiled python module, or
PostgreSQL's libpq library). pg8000 supports the standard
Python DB-API version 2.0.
