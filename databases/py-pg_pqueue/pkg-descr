PQueue is a package providing low-level PQ protocol classes for
interacting with a PostgreSQL database. It supports version 3.0
of the protocol--the current primary version of protocol. The
package also provides a basic protocol transaction class. This
class keeps the state of the protocol in an interrupt safe manner,
and validates the integrity of the communication as messages are
received.

In general, you probably will never use this package directly,
unless you are writing a driver.
