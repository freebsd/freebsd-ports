SQL Buddy is an open source project designed to change
the way people think about MySQL. Databases are an
essential part of most projects - who knew that working
with a database could also be intuitive?

unexpectedly warm feelings toward MySQL. Who knows, maybe its
time to let your database server move in from the garage.

* No setup
    Just unzip the files to your server and its ready to use.
    Seriously, the next step is logging in.
* Complete control of users
    Logins are handled directly by MySQL. Create as many or
    as few users as you want.
* Speaks your language
