Remember to run mysql_upgrade the first time you start the MySQL server
after an upgrade from an earlier version.

Initial password for first time use of MySQL is saved in $HOME/.mysql_secret
ie. when you want to use "mysql -u root -p" first you should see password
in /root/.mysql_secret

The default location for my.cnf has changed from "/var/db/mysql/my.cnf" to
"/usr/local/etc/mysql/my.cnf". Existing my.cnf files must be merged manually
with the new default and moved to the new location. To continue using the
my.cnf file at the old location, set "mysql_optfile" in /etc/rc.conf to
point to the location of the existing my.cnf file.
