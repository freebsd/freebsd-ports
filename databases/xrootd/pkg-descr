The XROOTD project aims at giving high performance, scalable fault tolerant
access to data repositories of many kinds. The typical usage is to give access
to file-based ones. It is based on a scalable architecture, a communication
protocol, and a set of plugins and tools based on those. The freedom to
configure it and to make it scale (for size and performance) allows the
deployment of data access clusters of virtually any size, which can include
sophisticated features, like authentication/authorization, integrations with
other systems, WAN data distribution, etc.

XRootD software framework is a fully generic suite for fast, low latency and
scalable data access, which can serve natively any kind of data, organized as a
hierarchical filesystem-like namespace, based on the concept of directory. As a
general rule, particular emphasis has been put in the quality of the core
software parts.
