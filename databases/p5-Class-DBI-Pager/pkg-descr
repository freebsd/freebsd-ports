Class::DBI::Pager is a plugin for Class::DBI, which glues Data::Page with
Class::DBI. This module reduces your work a lot, for example when you have to
do something like:

* retrieve objects from a database
* display objects with 20 items per page

In addition, your work will be reduced more, when you use Template-Toolkit as
your templating engine
