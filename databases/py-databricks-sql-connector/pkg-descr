The Databricks SQL Connector for Python allows you to develop Python
applications that connect to Databricks clusters and SQL warehouses. It is a
Thrift-based client with no dependencies on ODBC or JDBC. It conforms to the
Python DB API 2.0 specification.

This connector uses Arrow as the data-exchange format, and supports APIs (e.g.
fetchmany_arrow) to directly fetch Arrow tables. Arrow tables are wrapped in the
ArrowQueue class to provide a natural API to get several rows at a time. PyArrow
is required to enable this and use these APIs, you can install it via pip
install pyarrow or pip install databricks-sql-connector[pyarrow].

The connector includes built-in support for HTTP/HTTPS proxy servers with
multiple authentication methods including basic authentication and
Kerberos/Negotiate authentication. See docs/proxy.md and
examples/proxy_authentication.py for details.
