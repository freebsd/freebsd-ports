SQL Workbench/J is a free, DBMS-independent, cross-platform SQL
query tool. It is written in Java and should run on any operating
system that provides a Java Runtime Environment.

Its main focus is on running SQL scripts (either interactively or
as a batch) and export/import features. Graphical query building
or more advanced DBA tasks are not the focus and are not planned.
