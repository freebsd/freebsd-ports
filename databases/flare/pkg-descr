Flare is distributed, and persistent key-value storage compatible
w/ memcached, and has more features(as follows):

 * persistent storage (you can use flare as persistent memcached)
 * pluggable storage (currently only Tokyo Cabinet is available, though:)
 * data replication (synchronous or asynchronous)
 * data partitioning (automatically partitioned according to # of master
   servers (clients do not have to care about it))
 * dynamic reconstruction, and partitioning (you can dynamically (I mean,
   without any service interruption) add slave servers and partition
   master servers)
 * node monitoring and failover (if any server is down, the server is
   automatically isolated from active servers and another slave server
   is promoted to master server)
 * request proxy (you can always get same result regardless of servers
   you connect to. so you can think flare servers as one big key-value
   storage)
 * over 256 bytes keys, and over 1M bytes values are available
