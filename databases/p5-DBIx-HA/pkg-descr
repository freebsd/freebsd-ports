DBIx::HA is a High Availability module for DBI. It is implemented by
overloading the DBI connect, prepare and execute methods and can be
seamlessly used without code modification except for initialization.

DBIx::HA also works seamlessly with Apache::DBI when available, and
ensures that cached database handles in the Apache::DBI module are
properly updated when failing over.
