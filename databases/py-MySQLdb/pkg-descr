You can easily access a MySQL database through the Python MySQL module.

This module should be mostly compatible with an older interface written by
Joe Skinner and others. However, the older version is 

 a) not thread-friendly (database operations could cause all other threads to
    block),
 b) written for MySQL 3.21 (does not compile against newer versions without
    patches),
 c) apparently not actively maintained.

MySQLdb is a completely new module, distributed free of charge under a license
derived from the Python license.
