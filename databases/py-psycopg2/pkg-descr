psycopg2 is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
It was written from scratch with the aim of being small, fast and stable. It
supports the full Python DBAPI-2.0 and is thread safe.

psycopg2 is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of cursors
and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs. Every open
Python connection keeps a pool of real (UNIX or TCP/IP) connections to the
database. Every time a new cursor is created, a new connection does not need to
be opened; instead one of the unused connections from the pool is used. That
makes psycopg very fast in typical client-server applications that create a
servicing thread every time a client request arrives.
