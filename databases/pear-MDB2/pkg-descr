PEAR MDB2 is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase php database abstraction
layers.

It provides a common API for all supported RDBMS. The main difference to
most other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes much further to
ensure portability. MDB2 provides most of its many features optionally
that can be used to construct portable SQL statements.
