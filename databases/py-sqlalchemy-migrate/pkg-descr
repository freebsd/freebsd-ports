Inspired by Ruby on Rails' migrations, Migrate provides a way to deal
with database schema changes in SQLAlchemy projects. Migrate extends
SQLAlchemy to have database changeset handling. It provides a database
change repository mechanism which can be used from the command line as
well as from inside python code.
