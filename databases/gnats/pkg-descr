	GNATS - GNU Problem Report Management System

This directory contains GNATS, a problem tracking system written to
help report on, and track, problem reports or bugs. GNATS is currently
in use at Cygnus to help track all incoming bug reports.  There are
many concepts or approaches to GNATS which are only useful to
organizations which track bugs related by customers as well as by bug
type.

The file gnats.texi contains a Texinfo version of the main
documentation for GNATS, including installation notes and configuration
strategies.  gnats.info is a version of the same text as gnats.texi in a
form readable by GNU Info.

The file INSTALL contains a brief discussion of the installation
process; refer to gnats.texi for details on configuration, installation,
and usage.

Please report all GNATS bugs to bug-gnats@prep.ai.mit.edu.
