PgDBF is a program for converting XBase databases - particularly FoxPro
tables with memo files - into a format that PostgreSQL can directly
import. It's a compact C project with no dependencies other than standard
Unix libraries. While the project is relatively tiny and simple, it's also
heavily optimized via profiling - routine benchmark were many times faster
than with other Open Source programs. In fact, even on slower systems,
conversions are typically limited by hard drive speed.
