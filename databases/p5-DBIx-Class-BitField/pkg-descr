This module is useful if you manage data which has a lot of on/off attributes
like active, inactive, deleted, important, etc. If you do not want to add an
extra column for each of those attributes you can easily specify them in one
integer column.

A bit field is a way to store multiple bit values on one integer field.

The main benefit from this module is that you can add additional attributes
to your result class whithout the need to deploy or change the schema on the
data base.
