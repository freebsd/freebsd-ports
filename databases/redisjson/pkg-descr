RedisJSON is a Redis module that implements ECMA-404 The JSON Data
Interchange Standard as a native data type.  It allows storing,
updating and fetching JSON values from Redis keys (documents).

Primary features:
- Full support of the JSON standard
- JSONPath-like syntax for selecting elements inside documents
- Documents are stored as binary data in a tree structure, allowing
  fast access to sub-elements
- Typed atomic operations for all JSON values types
