BDB is a set of classes implementing an interface to
Berkeley DB for the GNUstep and Mac OS X environment written in
Objective-C language. It is based on the C API of
Berkeley DB and offers an object oriented interface which relies on
classes and mechanisms offered by the Foundation library.

In its present state BDB just offers a reduced set of functionality of
Berkeley DB.
