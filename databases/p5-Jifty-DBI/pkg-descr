Jifty::DBI deals with databases, so that you don't have to.

This module provides an object-oriented mechanism for retrieving and
updating data in a DBI-accesible database.

This module is the direct descendent of DBIx::SearchBuilder. If you're
familiar with SearchBuilder, Jifty::DBI should be quite familiar to you.
