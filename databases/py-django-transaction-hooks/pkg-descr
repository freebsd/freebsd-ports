A better alternative to the native transaction signals of Django.

Sometimes you need to fire off an action related to the current database
transaction, but only if the transaction successfully commits. Examples:
a Celery task, an email notification, or a cache invalidation.

Doing this correctly while accounting for savepoints that might be
individually rolled back, closed/dropped connections, and idiosyncrasies of
various databases, is non-trivial. Transaction signals just make it easier
to do it wrong.

django-transaction-hooks does the heavy lifting so you don't have to.
