SQL::Interp converts a list of intermixed SQL fragments and
variable references into a conventional SQL string and list
of bind values suitable for passing onto DBI. This simple
technique creates database calls that are simpler to create
and easier to read, while still giving you full access to
custom SQL.

SQL::Interp properly binds or escapes variables. This recommended
practice safeguards against "SQL injection" attacks. The DBI
documentation has several links on the topic.

Besides the simple techniques shown above, The SQL-Interpolate
distribution includes the optional DBIx::Interp module.
