PEAR::MDB_QueryTool is an OO-abstraction to the SQL-Query language, it provides
methods such as setWhere, setOrder, setGroup, setJoin, etc. to easily build
queries.

It also provides an easy to learn interface that interacts nicely with
HTML-forms using arrays that contain the column data, that shall be
updated/added in a DB. This package bases on an SQL-Builder which lets you
easily build SQL-Statements and execute them.

NB: this is a PEAR::MDB porting from the original DB_QueryTool written by
Wolfram Kriesing and Paolo Panto (vision:produktion, wk@visionp.de).
