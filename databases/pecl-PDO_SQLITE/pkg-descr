This extension provides an SQLite v3 driver for PDO.
SQLite V3 is NOT compatible with the bundled SQLite 2 in PHP 5,
but is a significant step forwards, featuring complete
utf-8 support, native support for blobs, native support for
prepared statements with bound parameters and improved concurrency.
