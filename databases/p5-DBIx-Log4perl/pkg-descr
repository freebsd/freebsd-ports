DBIx::Log4perl is a wrapper over DBI which adds logging of your DBI activity
via a Log::Log4perl handle. Log::Log4perl has many advantages for logging
but the ones probably most attractive are:

The ability to turn logging on or off or change the logging you see without
changing your code.

Different log levels allowing you to separate warnings, errors and fatals
to different files.
