In order to start pgpool you need some more configuration:

# sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf pgpool_enable="YES"
# sysrc -f /etc/rc.conf pgpool_user="root"

Please consider the usage of another user. The user is
required to have read/write access to /var/run/pgpool.

Using the root user is - as always - an security issue.
