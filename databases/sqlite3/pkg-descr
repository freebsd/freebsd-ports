SQLite is an SQL database engine in a C library. Programs that link the SQLite
library can have SQL database access without running a separate RDBMS process.
The distribution comes with a standalone command-line access program (sqlite3)
that can be used to administer an SQLite database and which serves as an
example of how to use the SQLite library.
