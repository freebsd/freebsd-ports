===>  CONFIGURATION NOTES:

      PERFORMANCE
         For best response (minimal delay) most sites will wish to uncomment this line
         from %%PREFIX%%/etc/couchdb/local.ini:

            socket_options = [{recbuf, 262144}, {sndbuf, 262144}, {nodelay, true}]

         Otherwise you'll see a large delay when establishing connections to the DB.

      ADMIN ACCOUNT
         By default no admin password or account is configured which leaves the DB
         server open.  Add accounts to the bottom of %%PREFIX%%/etc/couchdb/local.ini
         to secure your installation (by default CouchDB listens on localhost only).

      DATABASE LOCATION
	 The DB files themselves are now stored in /var/db/couchdb by default.
	 Previous versions of this port defaulted to /var/lib/couchdb, and if
	 you installed directly from source /usr/local/lib/couchdb.

	 If you are upgrading you may need to move your DB files to /var/db/couchdb
	 if you are not specifying database_dir and view_index_dir locations
         in local.ini.
