Usually when you have to store persistent data you don't need a
full-blown database server, just a ASCII database would do the
trick.

AsciiDB::Tag allows you to access a simple ASCII database using a
perl hash variable. The database format is straightforward so you
can edit it by hand if you need so. Each record is stored into a
file, and a record is just a set of values tagged by the field
name.
