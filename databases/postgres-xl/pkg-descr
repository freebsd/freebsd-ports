Postgres-XL is an open source project to provide both write-scalability and
massively parallel processing transparently to PostgreSQL. It is a collection
of tightly coupled database components which can be installed on more than one
system or virtual machine.

Write-scalable means Postgres-XL can be configured with as many database
servers as you want and handle many more writes (updating SQL statements) than
a single standalone database server could otherwise do. You can have more than
one database server that provides a single database view. Any database update
from any database server is immediately visible to any other transactions
running on different servers. Transparent means you do not necessarily need
to worry about how your data is stored in more than one database servers
internally.
