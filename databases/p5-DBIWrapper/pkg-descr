DBIWrapper is a generic database Perl module for accessing
the Perl DBI database interface.  It provides the lowest level
of functionality needed by any program wanting to access
databases via the DBI.  Currently, DBIWrapper is only
aware of Pg (PostgreSQL), mysql (MySQL) and ODBC DBD
modules and how to work with them correctly.

Support for transactions on MySQL is now checked for and
if found to be available, the AutoCommit flag is turned
off so that transactions will be used.
