Not to be confused with the dm-pagination gem (a similar gem
lacking in functionality) dm-pager is a new, fresh, and feature
rich pagination implementation for DataMapper. Due to Github's gem
builder being destroyed, we were forced to rename our gem to
'dm-pager' which is now available on Gemcutter.org.
