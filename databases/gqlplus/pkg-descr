gqlplus is a drop-in replacement for sqlplus, an Oracle SQL client, for
UNIX platforms. The difference between gqlplus and sqlplus is command-line
editing and history, plus tablename completion. As you know if you have
used sqlplus, it is notoriously difficult to correct typing errors and
other mistakes in your SQL statements. sqlplus does give you ability to
use external editor to edit a statement, but only the last statement you
typed. gqlplus solves this problem by providing the familiar command-line
editing and history as in tcsh or bash shells, and tablename completion,
while otherwise retaining compatibility with sqlplus. Thus, no user training
is needed - simply use gqlplus instead of sqlplus. In addition,
configuration/installation is trivial: gqlplus is a single binary compiled
executable (written in C), so all you need is download it and put it anywhere
in your PATH. After that, you'll be ready to use it.
