This library is a lightweight database abstraction layer designed to make
it simple to write high performance applications using SQL databases from
Objective-C.
The library consists of a semi-abstract superclass doing much of the work
and allowing extremely simple database specific bundles to be written to
talk to particular database servers.  It comes with backend bundles for
Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite (plus an untested Oracle bundle).
