This is version 1.2.0 of pg95perl5.

Pg95perl5 is an interface between Larry Wall's language perl version 5 and
the database Postgres95. This has been done by using the Perl 5 application
program- ming interface for C extensions which calls the Postgres
programmer's interface LIBQ.

Pg95perl5 is based on the pgperl package from Igor Metz and Robert Withrow.
Because the perl interface changed, this interface has been rewritten
following the guidelines from the perlapi manpage. Also the test script
has been adapted to SQL, which has replaced the query language POSTQUEL.
