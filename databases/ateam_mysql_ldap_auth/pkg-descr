A-Team MySQL LDAP Authenticator (ateam_mysql_ldap_auth) is an authentication
plugin for MySQL 5.5.7 and up, and has been tested with 5.6 under FreeBSD.
This module allows you to create MySQL users that are then authenticated
against an LDAP server. This reduces administrative overhead and eliminates
your users having to remember a seperate username and password for MySQL.
Just like MySQL Enterprise's PAM module, for client side authentication
this plugin uses the clear_text password module as the LDAP server must
perform the password hasing and comparison.  For command line clients this
is done by setting the following environment variable:

  export LIBMYSQL_ENABLE_CLEARTEXT_PLUGIN=1

In MySQL Workbench this is acheived by going to go to the "Advanced" tab and
checking "Enable Cleartext Authentication Plugin" when editing a connction.

!!! IMPORTANT:
!!! ------------------------------------------------------------------------
!!! ENSURE THE COMMUNICATIONS PATH BETWEEN THE CLIENT AND SERVER IS SECURE!
!!! ------------------------------------------------------------------------
!!! By default MySQL does not use SSL so additional steps and network design
!!! are needed to ensure you're not exposing your credetials.
