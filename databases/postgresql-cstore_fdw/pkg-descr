Cstore_fdw is a extension of PostgreSQL. This extension uses the Optimized Row
Columnar (ORC) format for its data layout. ORC improves upon the RCFile format
developed at Facebook, and brings the following benefits:
	- Compression: Reduces in-memory and on-disk data size by 2-4x. Can be
	  extended to support different codecs.
	- Column projections: Only reads column data relevant to the query.
	  Improves performance for I/O bound queries.
	- Skip indexes: Stores min/max statistics for row groups, and uses them
	  to skip over unrelated rows.
Further, cstore_fdw used the Postgres foreign data wrapper APIs and type
representations with this extension. This brings:
	- Support for 40+ Postgres data types. The user can also create new types
	  and use them.
	- Statistics collection. PostgreSQL's query optimizer uses these stats to
	  evaluate different query plans and pick the best one.
	- Simple setup. Create foreign table and copy data. Run SQL.
