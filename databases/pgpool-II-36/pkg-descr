pgpool is a connection pool server for PostgreSQL. pgpool runs between
PostgreSQL's clients(front ends) and servers(back ends). A PostgreSQL client can
connect to pgpool as if it were a standard PostgreSQL server.

pgpool caches the connection to PostgreSQL server to reduce the overhead to
establish the connection to it.
