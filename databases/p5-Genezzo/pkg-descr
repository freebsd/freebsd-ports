The Genezzo modules implement a hierarchy of persistent hashes using a
fixed amount of memory and disk.  This system is designed to be easily
configured and extended with custom functions, persistent storage
representations, and novel data access methods.  In its current
incarnation it supports a subset of SQL and a partial DBI interface.
