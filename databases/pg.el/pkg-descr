This is an Emacs Lisp interface for PostgreSQL.

This module lets you access the PostgreSQL object-relational DBMS from
Emacs, using its socket-level frontend/backend protocol. The module is
capable of automatic type coercions from a range of SQL types to the
equivalent Emacs Lisp type. This is a low level API, and won't be
useful to end users.
