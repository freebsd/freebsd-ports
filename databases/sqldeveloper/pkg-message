Note for Oracle users:

    In order to connect in a simple way to an Oracle database, it is needed to
    set ORACLE_HOME environment variable and then locate in a
    $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/ directory a valid tnsnames.ora services file.
    Alternatively, you can set TNS_ADMIN to point out directly to that
    tnsnames.ora file.

    After that choose "TNS" as "Connection Type" when you are going to add a
    new connection database.


Note for MySQL users:

    If you have enabled mysql support, it is needed to point out to SQL
    Developer where the MySQL JDBC classes are. Go to Tools -> Preferences
    menu, select Database -> Third Party JDBC Drivers and add the proper jar.
    Do not install 5.1 version of mysql jdbc connector; see
    https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/sql-developer/18.4/rptig/installing-sql-developer.html#GUID-3F68CF20-D03D-431C-A9A2-0EB971F06448

The Java versions supported by this port are in range from 11 to 17. The default
is 11. Add DEFAULT_VERSIONS+=java=N to /etc/make.conf if you want to use Java
"N", but all Java ports will also be affected. Or add SQLDEVELOPER_JAVA_VERSION=N
to /etc/make.conf if you want to override the Java version for this port only.
