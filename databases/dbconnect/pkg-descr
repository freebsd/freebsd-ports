DBConnect (Database Connect) API is an easy to use C++ object API to allow
applications to connect to databases. Your DB applications can now become
cross platform and cross databased.

The API currently implements MySQL, Oracle8 and PostGreSQL drivers in the
Unix environments and MySQL, Oracle8 and ODBC in the Windows environment.
