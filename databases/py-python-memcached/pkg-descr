The API takes advantage of the server's opaque flag support and sets its
"complex" flag whenever the object being stored or retrieved isn't a plain
scalar. In that case, the Storable module is used to freeze and thaw the
value automatically going in and out of the memcached.

The Python API, while tested, has not experienced real-world production use.
