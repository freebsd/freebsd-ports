Under Python2, this package forks both Python 2.7's pickle and
cPickle modules, adding support for the protocol 3 opcodes. It also
provides a new subclass of bytes, zodbpickle.binary, which Python2
applications can use to pickle binary values such that they will be
unpickled as bytes under Py3k.

Under Py3k, this package forks the pickle module (and the supporting
C extension) from both Python 3.2 and Python 3.3. The fork add support
for the noload operations used by ZODB.
