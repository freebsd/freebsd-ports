DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader automates the definition of a
DBIx::Class::Schema by scanning table schemas and setting up columns and
primary keys.

DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader supports MySQL, Postgres, SQLite and DB2.
See DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::Generic for more, and
DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::Writing for notes on writing your own
db-specific subclass for an unsupported db.

This module requires DBIx::Class 0.05 or later, and obsoletes
DBIx::Class::Loader for DBIx::Class version 0.05 and later.

While on the whole, the bare table definitions are fairly straightforward,
relationship creation is somewhat heuristic, especially in the choosing
of relationship types, join types, and relationship names.  The relationships
generated by this module will probably never be as well-defined as
hand-generated ones.  Because of this, over time a complex project will
probably wish to migrate off of L<DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader>.

It is designed more to get you up and running quickly against an existing
database, or to be effective for simple situations, rather than to be what
you use in the long term for a complex database/project.
