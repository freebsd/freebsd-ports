postgresql-relay can be used to as a single point of origin for all
your databases. Instead of having to remember (or modify in case
of changes) all the names of your databases, on which machines and
on which ports they are running, you only need to remember one
machine and the name of the database. The postgresql-relay will
then forward the connection to the proper database on the proper
port of the proper server. No more changes in the hundreds of clients
and scripts!
