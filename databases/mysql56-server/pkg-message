Remember to run mysql_upgrade the first time you start the MySQL server
after an upgrade from an earlier version.

Initial password for first time use of MySQL is saved in $HOME/.mysql_secret
ie. when you want to use "mysql -u root -p" first you should see password
in /root/.mysql_secret

Please keep in mind that the default location for my.cnf will be changed
from "/var/db/mysql/my.cnf" to "/usr/local/etc/mysql/my.cnf" in the near
future.  If you do not want to move your my.cnf to the new location then
you must set "mysql_optfile" in /etc/rc.conf to "/var/db/mysql/my.cnf".
