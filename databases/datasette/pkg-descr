Datasette is a tool for exploring and publishing data. It helps people take
data of any shape or size and publish that as an interactive, explorable
website and accompanying API.

Datasette is aimed at data journalists, museum curators, archivists, local
governments, scientists, researchers and anyone else who has data that they
wish to share with the world.
