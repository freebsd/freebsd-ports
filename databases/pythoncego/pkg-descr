The Cego Python driver enables Python programs to access cego databases,
using an API which is compliant with the Python DB API 2.0 (PEP-249).
It is written in C and uses the Cego C wrapper client library for
client server communication.

This implementation is derived from the MariaDB Connector written
by Georg Richter.
