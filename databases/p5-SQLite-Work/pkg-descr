This generates HTML (and non-HTML) reports from an SQLite database, taking
care of the query-building and the report formatting. This also has methods
for adding and updating the database.

Reports can have nested headers which depend on the sort-order given. One can
select the columns and order in which the values are displayed. The HTML page
generated can be customized with templates.

The SQLite::Work::CGI module has extra methods which deal with CGI using the
CGI module.

The sqlreport script uses SQLite::Work to generate reports from the
command-line.
