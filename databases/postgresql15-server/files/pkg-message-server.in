For procedural languages and postgresql functions, please note that
you might have to update them when updating the server.

If you have many tables and many clients running, consider raising
kern.maxfiles using sysctl(8), or reconfigure your kernel
appropriately.

The port is set up to use autovacuum for new databases, but you might
also want to vacuum and perhaps backup your database regularly. There
is a periodic script, %%PREFIX%%/etc/periodic/daily/502.pgsql, that
you may find useful. You can use it to backup and perform vacuum on all
databases nightly. Per default, it performs `vacuum analyze'. See the
script for instructions. For autovacuum settings, please review
~%%PG_USER%%/data/postgresql.conf.

If you plan to access your PostgreSQL server using ODBC, please
consider running the SQL script %%PREFIX%%/share/postgresql/odbc.sql
to get the functions required for ODBC compliance.

Please note that if you use the rc script,
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/postgresql, to initialize the database, unicode
(UTF-8) will be used to store character data by default.  Set
postgresql_initdb_flags or use login.conf settings described below to
alter this behaviour. See the start rc script for more info.

To set limits, environment stuff like locale and collation and other
things, you can set up a class in /etc/login.conf before initializing
the database. Add something similar to this to /etc/login.conf:
---
%%PG_USER%%:\
	:lang=en_US.UTF-8:\
	:setenv=LC_COLLATE=C:\
	:tc=default:
---
and run `cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf'.
Then add 'postgresql_login_class="%%PG_USER%%"' to /etc/rc.conf, or
set it as the %%PG_USER%% user's login class in /etc/passwd.

======================================================================

To use PostgreSQL, enable it in rc.conf using

  sysrc postgresql_enable=yes

To initialize the database, run

  service postgresql initdb

You can then start PostgreSQL by running:

  service postgresql start

For postmaster settings, see ~%%PG_USER%%/data/postgresql.conf

NB. FreeBSD's PostgreSQL port logs to syslog by default
    See ~%%PG_USER%%/data/postgresql.conf for more info

NB. If you're not using a checksumming filesystem like ZFS, you might
    wish to enable data checksumming. It can be enabled during
    the initdb phase, by adding the "--data-checksums" flag to
    the postgresql_initdb_flags rcvar. Otherwise you can enable it later by
    using pg_checksums.  Check the initdb(1) manpage for more info
    and make sure you understand the performance implications.

======================================================================

SECURITY ADVICE

If upgrading from a version 15.x < 15.7:
A security vulnerability was found in the system views pg_stats_ext
and pg_stats_ext_exprs, potentially allowing authenticated database
users to see data they shouldn't.  If this is of concern in your
installation, run the SQL script %%DATADIR%%/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql
for each of your databases. For details, see
https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-4317/
