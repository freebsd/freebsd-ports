The T2 module is a base for the refactoring of the now quite stable
Tangram Object-Relational mapper.

In a nutshell, it lets you store objects - which have to be described to a
similar level that you would describe a database to store them - into any
SQL store. Currently, this is tested on PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and
Sybase a lot, though in general database-specific extensions to SQL, such
as triggers, stored procedures, etc are avoided. So, if DBI installs and
tests successfully with your database, there is a good chance that T2 will
work with it too.

The only current requirement is that objects that have tables associated
with them are implemented via hashes. You also have to be able to describe
all of the fields for those root objects. Individual fields of stored
objects may be arbitrarily complex.

If you are familiar with DBI, it is somewhat similar to bless'ing the
structures returned by $dbh->fetchrow_hashref, except that references and
collections to other objects in the store are loaded `on demand' (aka
Lazy-loading).
