The purpose of DBIx::Browse is to handle the browsing of relational
tables.

DBIx::Browse transparently translates SELECTs, UPDATEs, DELETEs and
INSERTs from the desired "human view" to the values needed for the ta-
ble. This is the case when you have related tables (1 to n) where the
detail table has a reference (FOREIGN KEY) to a generic table (i.e.
Customers and Bills) with some index (tipically an integer).
