A declarative layer on top of SQLAlchemy. It is a fairly thin wrapper, which
provides the ability to define model objects following the Active Record
design pattern, and using a DSL syntax similar to that of the Ruby on Rails
ActiveRecord system.

Elixir does not intend to replace SQLAlchemy's core features, but instead
focuses on providing a simpler syntax for defining model objects when you do
not need the full expressiveness of SQLAlchemy's manual mapper definitions.

Elixir is intended to replace the ActiveMapper SQLAlchemy extension, and the
TurboEntity project.
