There is no initial password for first time use of MySQL.
Keep in mind to reset it to a secure password.

MySQL80 has a default %%ETCDIR%%/my.cnf,
remember to replace it with your own
or set `mysql_optfile="$YOUR_CNF_FILE` in rc.conf.

{ type: upgrade
  message: <<EOM
As of MySQL 8.0.16, the MySQL server performs the upgrade tasks previously
handled by mysql_upgrade. Consequently, mysql_upgrade is unneeded and is
deprecated as of that version, and will be removed in a future MySQL version.
Because mysql_upgrade no longer performs upgrade tasks,
it exits with status 0 unconditionally.
