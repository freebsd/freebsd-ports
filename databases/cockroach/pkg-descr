CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database built on a transactional
and strongly-consistent key-value store. It scales horizontally;
survives disk, machine, rack, and even datacenter failures with
minimal latency disruption and no manual intervention; supports
strongly-consistent ACID transactions; and provides a familiar SQL
API for structuring, manipulating, and querying data.

CockroachDB is inspired by Google's Spanner and F1 technologies, and
it's completely open source.
