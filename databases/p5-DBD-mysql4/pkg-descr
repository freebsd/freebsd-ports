DBD::mysql is the Perl5 Database Interface driver for the MySQL
database.  In other words: DBD::mysql is an interface between the Perl
programming language and the MySQL programming API that comes with the
MySQL relational database management system.  Most functions provided by
this programming API are supported.  Some rarely used functions are
missing, mainly because noone ever requested them.
