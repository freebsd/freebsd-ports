CppDB is a SQL connectivity library that is designed to provide platform and
database independent connectivity API similarly to what JDBC, ODBC and other
connectivity libraries do. It supports Sqlite3, PostgreSQL, MySQL and as many
RDBMSs as possible via cppdb-odbc bridge.

It was written with performance, simplicity in use and locale safety as the
primary goals in mind. It also provides both explicit verbose API and brief
and nice syntactic sugar.
