This module provides a nearly complete wrapping of the Sleepycat C API
for the Database Environment, Database, Cursor, and Transaction
objects, and each of these is exposed as a Python Type in the
bsddb3.db module.  The database objects can use different access
methods, btree, hash, recno, and queue.  For the first time all of
these are fully supported in the Python wrappers.  Please see the
document in developers' web site for more details on the types and
methods provided.
