PgBouncer is a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Any target application can be
connected to PgBouncer as if it were a PostgreSQL server, and PgBouncer will
create a connection to the actual server, or it will reuse one of its existing
connections.

The aim of PgBouncer is to lower the performance impact of opening new
connections to PostgreSQL.

In order not to compromise transaction semantics for connection pooling,
PgBouncer supports several types of pooling when rotating connections:

* Session pooling

Most polite method. When a client connects, a server connection will be assigned
to it for the whole duration it stays connected. When the client disconnects,
the server connection will be put back into pool. This mode supports all
PostgreSQL features.

* Transaction pooling

A server connection is assigned to a client only during a transaction. When
PgBouncer notices that the transaction is over, the server will be put back into
the pool.

This mode breaks a few session-based features of PostgreSQL. You can use it only
when the application cooperates by not using features that break. See the table
below for incompatible features.

* Statement pooling

Most aggressive method. This is transaction pooling with a twist:
Multi-statement transactions are disallowed. This is meant to enforce
"autocommit" mode on the client, mostly targeted at PL/Proxy.
