  =========== BACKUP YOUR DATA! =============
  As always, backup your data before
  upgrading. If the upgrade leads to a higher
  major revision (e.g. 9.6 -> 10), a dump
  and restore of all databases is
  required. This is *NOT* done by the port!
  See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html
