What is MDB Tools?

MDB Tools is a planned set of libraries and utilities to facilitate exporting
data from MS Access databases (mdb files) into a multiuser database such as
Oracle, Sybase, DB2, Informix, MySQL, Postgresql, or similar. A nice little
Gtk MDB file browser will probably be written as well.

Ok, how much is done?

You can list catalog entries. There is some preliminary schema exporting
utility. And you can export data out to CSV (comma separated value) format.
