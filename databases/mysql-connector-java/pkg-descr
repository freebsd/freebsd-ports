MySQL Connector/J is a native Java driver that converts JDBC (Java
Database Connectivity) calls into the network protocol used by the
MySQL database. It lets developers working with the Java programming
language easily build programs and applets that interact with MySQL
and connect all corporate data, even in a heterogeneous
environment. MySQL Connector/J is a Type IV JDBC driver and has a
complete JDBC feature set that supports the capabilities of MySQL.

This port is derived from the original databases/mysql-jdbc-mm port of
the mm.mysql JDBC connector by dglo@ssec.wisc.edu.
