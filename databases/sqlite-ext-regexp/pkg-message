*********************************************************************
Loading extensions is by default prohibited as a security measure;
see "Security Considerations" in
http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=LoadableExtensions.

If the sqlite3 program and library are built this way, you cannot
use these functions from the program, you must write your own program
using the sqlite3 API, and call sqlite3_enable_load_extension as
described above, or else rebuilt the sqlite3 program to allow
loadable extensions.
