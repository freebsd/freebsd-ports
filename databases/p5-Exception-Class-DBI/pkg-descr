This module offers a set of DBI-specific exception classes. They
inherit from Exception::Class, the base class for all exception
objects created by the Exception::Class module from the CPAN.
Exception::Class::DBI itself offers a single class method, handler(),
that returns a code reference appropriate for passing to the DBI
HandleError attribute.
