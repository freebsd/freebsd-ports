PEAR::DB_QueryTool is an OO-abstraction to the SQL-Query language, it provides
methods such as setWhere, setOrder, setGroup, setJoin, etc. to easily build
queries.

It also provides an easy to learn interface that interacts nicely with
HTML-forms using arrays that contain the column data, that shall be
updated/added in a DB. This package bases on an SQL-Builder which lets you
easily build SQL-Statements and execute them.
