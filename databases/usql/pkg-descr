usql provides a simple way of working with SQL databases via a command-line
inspired by PostgreSQL's psql tool and has a few additional features that psql
does not, such as syntax highlighting and context-based completion.

Database administrators and developers that would prefer to work with
non-PostgreSQL databases with a tool like psql, will find usql intuitive,
easy-to-use, and a great replacement for the command-line clients/tools
available for other databases.
