This module was inspired by the excellent DBIx::Abstract. However, in
using the module I found that what I wanted to do was generate SQL, but
still retain complete control over my statement handles and use the DBI
interface. So, I set out to create an abstract SQL generation module.

This module is based largely on DBIx::Abstract. However, there are
several important differences, especially when it comes to WHERE
clauses. I have modified the concepts used to make the SQL easier to
generate from Perl data structures and, IMO, more intuitive.
