With Relations::Query you can create a 'select' query by creating a new
query object, and passing hashes, arrays, or strings of info to the
constructor, such as what's within the variables clause, what to order
by, etc.  You can also add and override clause info in the query as
well,  on both a permanent and temporary basis. With the to_string()
function, you can create a query string from a hash, query object or
string.
