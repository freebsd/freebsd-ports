Mtools is a collection of helper scripts to parse and filter MongoDB
log files (mongod, mongos), visualize log files and quickly set up
complex MongoDB test environments on a local machine:

* mlogfilter * slices log files by time, merges log files, filters
  slow queries, finds table scans, shortens log lines, filters by
  other atributes, convert to JSON;

* mloginfo * returns info about log file, like start and end time,
  version, binary, special sections like restarts, connections,
  distinct view;

* mplotqueries * visualize logfiles with different types of plots;

* mlogvis * creates a self-contained html file that shows an interactive
  visualization in a web browser (as an alternative to mplotqueries);

* mlaunch * a script to quickly spin up local test environments,
  including replica sets and sharded systems;

* mgenerate * generates structured pseudo-random data based on a
  template for testing and reproduction.
