SOCI is a database access library for C++ that makes the illusion of embedding
SQL queries in the regular C++ code, staying entirely within the Standard C++.
The idea is to provide C++ programmers a way to access SQL databases in the most
natural and intuitive way. If you find existing libraries too difficult for your
needs or just distracting, SOCI can be a good alternative.
