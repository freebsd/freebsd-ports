JRobin is a 100% pure java implementation of RRDTool's functionality. It
follows the same logic and uses the same data sources, archive types and
definitions as RRDTool does. JRobin supports all standard operations on
Round Robin Database (RRD) files: CREATE, UPDATE, FETCH, LAST, DUMP, XPORT
and GRAPH. JRobin's API is made for those who are familiar with RRDTool's
concepts and logic, but prefer to work with pure java. If you provide the
same data to RRDTool and JRobin, you will get exactly the same results and
graphs. JRobin is made from the scratch and it uses very limited portions
of RRDTool's original source code. JRobin does not use native functions and
libraries, has no Runtime.exec() calls and does not require RRDTool to be
present. JRobin is distributed as a software library (jar files) and comes
with full java source code (LGPL licence).
