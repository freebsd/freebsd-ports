Pure Python
All code, at first, is written in pure Python so that py-postgresql will work
anywhere that you can install Python 3. Optimizations in C are made where
needed, but are always optional.

Prepared Statements
Using the PG-API interface, protocol-level prepared statements may be created
and used multiple times. db.prepare(sql)(*args)

COPY Support
Use the convenient COPY interface to directly copy data from one connection to
another. No intermediate files or tricks are necessary.

Arrays and Composite Typescw
Arrays and composites are fully supported. Queries requesting them will returns
objects that provide access to the elements within.

scripts.
