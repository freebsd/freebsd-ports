DBIx::Ease is intended to allow less-code DBI interactions.

Upon creation of a new DBIx::Ease object you should pass the portion of the DSN
(Data Source Name) common to all connections the object is supposed to store.
Replace the variable portions with '<databasename>'.  Whenever you wish to make
only one connection you may enter the complete DSN, also when you want to make
connections with the same source but as different users, then call exec() with
different names of your choice as  initial argument.
