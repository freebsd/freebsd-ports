Qdrant is a vector similarity search engine and vector database.

It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store,
search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload.
Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all
sorts of neural-network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other

With Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into
full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much
more.
