The dbXML Core is a native XML database. As such it is a database
server intended to manage large numbers of small XML documents.
The documents are stored in collections and the server provides
the ability to query these collections using XPath. The server is
lightweight, modular and suitable for embedding in custom applications
or running as a standalone database.
