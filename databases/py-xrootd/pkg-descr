The XRootD project provides a high-performance, fault-tolerant, and secure
solution for handling massive amounts of data distributed across multiple
storage resources, such as disk servers, tape libraries, and remote sites. It
enables efficient data access and movement in a transparent and uniform manner,
regardless of the underlying storage technology or location. It was initially
developed by the High Energy Physics (HEP) community to meet the data storage
and access requirements of the BaBar experiment at SLAC and later extended to
meet the needs of experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. XRootD
is the core technology powering the EOS distributed filesystem, which is the
storage solution used by LHC experiments and the storage backend for CERNBox.
XRootD is also used as the core technology for global CDN deployments across
multiple science domains.

XRootD is based on a scalable architecture that supports multi-protocol
communications. XRootD provides a set of plugins and tools that allows the user
to configure it freely to deploy data access clusters of any size, and which can
include sophisticated features such as erasure coded files, various methods of
authentication and authorization, as well as integration with other storage
systems like ceph.

This port is the Python binding for XRootD.
