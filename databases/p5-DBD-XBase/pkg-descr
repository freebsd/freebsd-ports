Module XBase provides access to XBase (dBase, Fox*) database files,
namely dbf, dbt, fpt, ndx, ntx, mdx, idx and cdx. It provides native
Perl interface ($table->get_record, $table->update_record) to read
and write the tables. The index support is alpha and read only at the
moment.

Module DBD::XBase is a DBI driver that uses the XBase module
to work with the data, providing you with DBI compliant processing
interface and SQL commands ($dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM TABLE")). As
an argument to DBI->connect, specify "dbi:XBase:$dir", where $dir is
the directory with the data files.
