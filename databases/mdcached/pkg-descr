Bullet Cache is a memory database intended to be used much like memcached,
but offering much higher flexibility through use of record tags which can be
used to perform bulk operations on sets of records. It has its own binary
network protocol which is accessible through Unix domain sockets and through
TCP. It is indended to be accessed through a high-performance C library.
