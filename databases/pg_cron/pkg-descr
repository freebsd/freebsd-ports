pg_cron is a simple cron-based job scheduler for PostgreSQL (10 or higher) that
runs inside the database as an extension. It uses the same syntax as regular
cron, but it allows you to schedule PostgreSQL commands directly from the
database. You can also use '[1-59] seconds' to schedule a job based on an
interval.
