Queries is a BSD licensed opinionated wrapper of the psycopg2 library for
interacting with PostgreSQL.

The popular psycopg2 package is a full-featured python client. Unfortunately
as a developer, you're often repeating the same steps to get started with
your applications that use it. Queries aims to reduce the complexity of
psycopg2 while adding additional features to make writing PostgreSQL client
applications both fast and easy.
