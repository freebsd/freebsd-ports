Queries is a BSD licensed opinionated wrapper of the psycopg2 library for
interacting with PostgreSQL.

The popular psycopg2 package is a full-featured python client. Unfortunately as
a developer, you're often repeating the same steps to get started with your
applications that use it. Queries aims to reduce the complexity of psycopg2
while adding additional features to make writing PostgreSQL client applications
both fast and easy.
