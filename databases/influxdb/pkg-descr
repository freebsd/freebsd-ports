dependencies. InfluxDB is the new home for all of your metrics,
events, and analytics.

InfluxDB is a time series, metrics, and analytics database. It'written
in Go and has no external dependencies. That means once you install
it there's nothing else to manage (like Redis, ZooKeeper, HBase,
or whatever).

InfluxDB is targeted at use cases for DevOps, metrics, sensor data,
and real-time analytics. It arose from our need for a database like
this on more than a few previous products we' built. You can read
