SQL Relay is a persistent database connection pooling, proxying and
load balancing system for Unix and Linux supporting ODBC, Oracle,
MySQL, mSQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Interbase,
Lago and SQLite with C, C++, Perl, Perl-DBD, Python, Python-DB, Zope,
PHP, Ruby and Java APIs, command line clients, a GUI configuration
tool and extensive documentation.  The APIs support advanced database
operations such as bind variables, multi-row fetches, client side
result set caching and suspended transactions.  It is ideal for
speeding up database-driven web-based applications, accessing
databases from unsupported platforms, migrating between databases,
distributing access to replicated databases and throttling database
access.
