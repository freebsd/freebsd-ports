Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.

It is minimalistic because it just adds minimal support for the protocol,
but at the same time it uses an high level printf-alike API in order to make
it much higher level than otherwise suggested by its minimal code base and
the lack of explicit bindings for every Redis command.

Apart from supporting sending commands and receiving replies, it comes with
a reply parser that is decoupled from the I/O layer. It is a stream parser
designed for easy reusability, which can for instance be used in higher
level language bindings for efficient reply parsing.

Hiredis only supports the binary-safe Redis protocol, so you can use it with
any Redis version >= 1.2.0.

The library comes with multiple APIs. There is the synchronous API, the
asynchronous API and the reply parsing API.
