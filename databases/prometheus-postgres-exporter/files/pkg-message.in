{ type: install
  message: <<EOM
A sample configuration file has been installed in
%%PREFIX%%/etc/postgres_exporter.yml.sample.

To use postgres_exporter, copy this config file to "postgres_exporter.yml"
and edit as needed, then enable and start the service:

# service postgres_exporter enable
# service postgres_exporter start

For rc(8) options which can be used to configure the service, refer to
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/postgres_exporter.

For example, to log output to the 'local5' syslog facility instead of the
default 'daemon':

# sysrc postgres_exporter_syslog_output_facility=local5

By default, the exporter runs as the 'nobody' user and listens on
localhost:9187.  These defaults can be changed via rc(8).

For documentation on the configuration file format and how to integrate the
exporter into Prometheus, refer to the documentation at:
