{ type: install
  message: <<EOM
A sample configuration file has been installed in
%%PREFIX%%/etc/postgres_exporter.yml.sample.

To use postgres_exporter, copy this config file to "postgres_exporter.yml"
and edit as needed, then enable and start the service:

# service postgres_exporter enable
# service postgres_exporter start

For rc(8) options which can be used to configure the service, refer to
%%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/postgres_exporter.

For example, to log output to the 'local5' syslog facility instead of the
default 'daemon':

# sysrc postgres_exporter_syslog_output_facility=local5

By default, the exporter runs as the 'nobody' user and listens on
localhost:9187.  These defaults can be changed via rc(8).

For documentation on the configuration file format and how to integrate the
exporter into Prometheus, refer to the documentation at:
https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter

{ type: upgrade
  maximum_version: "0.16.0"
  message: <<EOM
BREAKING CHANGE: In postgres_exporter 0.16.0 and later, the log message format
has changed.  From the upstream release notes:

The logging system has been replaced with log/slog from the stdlib. This change
is being made across the prometheus ecosystem. The logging output has changed,
but the messages and levels remain the same. The ts label for the timestamp has
been replaced with time, the accuracy is less, and the timezone is not forced
to UTC. The caller field has been replaced by the source field, which now
includes the full path to the source file. The level field now exposes the log
level in capital letters.
