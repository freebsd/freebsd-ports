DBI::Shell
==========

The DBI::Shell module (and dbish command, if installed) provide a
simple but effective command line interface for the Perl DBI
module.

Please note: DBI::Shell is very new, very experimental and very
subject to change. Your mileage will vary. Interfaces will change
with each release.
