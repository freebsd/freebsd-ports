This module implements a caching layer around BerkeleyDB for object persistence.
It implements the basic methods necessary to add, retrieve, and remove objects.
The main advantage over other caching modules is performance. I've attempted to
stick with a Cache::Cache-like interface as much as possible, though it may
differ here and there.
