VirtualPG is a loadable dynamic extension to both SQLite and SpatiaLite.

Its intended scope is supporting direct SQL access to PostgreSQL and PostGIS own
tables, so to make any possible kind of data exchange between these two popular
open source Spatial DBMSes as straightforward and simple as possible.
