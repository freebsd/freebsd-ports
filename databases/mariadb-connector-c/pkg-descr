The MariaDB Connector/C is used to connect applications developed in C/C++
to MariaDB and MySQL databases. MySQL Connector/C is LGPL licensed.

Parts of MariaDB Connector/C are derived from PHP\'s mysqlnd extension and
the original LGPL MySQL client library for MySQL 3.23. The rest of the code
is written by developers at MariaDB Corporation Ab.
