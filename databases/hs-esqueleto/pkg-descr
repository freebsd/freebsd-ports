esqueleto is a bare bones, type-safe EDSL for SQL queries that works
with unmodified persistent SQL backends.  Its language closely resembles
SQL, so you don't have to learn new concepts, just new syntax, and it's
fairly easy to predict the generated SQL and optimize it for your
backend.  Most kinds of errors committed when writing SQL are caught as
compile-time errors---although it is possible to write type-checked
esqueleto queries that fail at runtime.
