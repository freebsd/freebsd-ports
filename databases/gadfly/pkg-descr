Gadfly is a relational database management system which uses a
large subset of very standard SQL as its query language and Python
modules and optional Python/C extension modules as its underlying
engine. Gadfly stores the active database in memory, with recovery
logging to a file system. It supports an optional TCP/IP based
client server mode and log based failure recovery for system or
software failures (but not for disk failures).
