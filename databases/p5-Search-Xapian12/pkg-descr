This module wraps most methods of most Xapian classes. The missing classes and
methods should be added in the future. It also provides a simplified, more
'perlish' interface - as demonstrated above.

The Xapian library is evolving very quickly at the time of writing, hence any
documentation placed here would be likely to become out of date quite rapidly,
and I do not have the patience to write some which could rapidly become
redundant.

Apologies to those of you considering using this module. For the time being, I
would suggest garnering what you can from the tests and examples provided, or
reading through the Xapian documentation on http://www.xapian.org/, notably the
API documentation at http://www.xapian.org/docs/apidoc/html/annotated.html

If you encounter problems, email either me or preferably the Xapian-discuss
mailing list (which I am on - subscription details can be found on the Xapian
web site).
