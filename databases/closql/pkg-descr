Store uniform EIEIO objects in an EmacSQL database. SQLite is used as
backend. This library imposes some restrictions on what kind of
objects can be stored; it isn't intended to store arbitrary
objects. All objects have to share a common superclass and subclasses
cannot add any additional instance slots.
