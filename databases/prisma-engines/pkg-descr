A collection of engines that power the core stack for Prisma, most prominently
Prisma Client and Prisma Migrate.

It contains four engines:

- Query engine, used by the client to run database queries from Prisma Client
- Query compiler, an actively developed replacement for the query engine, used
  to compile Prisma Client queries into query plans containing SQL statements
  and other operations, which the client can use to execute Prisma queries
  entirely in JS land
- Schema engine, used to create and run migrations and introspection
- Prisma Format, historically used to format prisma files (hence the name), now
  powers other LSP functionality as well
