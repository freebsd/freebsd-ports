Solid Cable is a database-backed Action Cable adapter that keeps messages in a
table and continously polls for updates. This makes it possible to drop the
common dependency on Redis, if it isn't needed for any other purpose. Despite
polling, the performance of Solid Cable is comparable to Redis in most
situations. And in all circumstances, it makes it easier to deploy Rails when
Redis is no longer a required dependency for Action Cable functionality.
