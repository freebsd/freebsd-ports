The official Python client for Riak.

Riak is a Dynamo-inspired key/value store that scales predictably and easily.
Riak also simplifies development by giving developers the ability to quickly
prototype, test, and deploy their applications. A truly fault-tolerant system,
Riak has no single point of failure. No machines are special or central in
Riak, so developers and operations professionals can decide exactly how
fault-tolerant they want and need their applications to be.
