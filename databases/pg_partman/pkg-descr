pg_partman is an extension to create and manage both time-based and
serial-based table partition sets. Sub-partitoning is also supported. 
Child table & trigger function creation is all managed by the extension 
itself. Tables with existing data can also have their data partitioned in 
easily managed smaller batches. Optional retention policy can automatically 
drop partitions no longer needed. A background worker (BGW) process is 
included to automatically run partition maintenance without the need of an 
external scheduler (cron, etc) in most cases.
