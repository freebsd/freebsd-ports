OpenTSDB is a distributed, scalable Time Series Database (TSDB) written
on top of HBase.  OpenTSDB was written to address a common need: store,
index and serve metrics collected from computer systems (network gear,
operating systems, applications) at a large scale, and make this data
easily accessible and graphable.
