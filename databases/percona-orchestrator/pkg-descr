Orchestrator is a replication topology manager for MySQL.

Features include:

* The topology and status of the replication tree is automatically detected
  and monitored.
* Either a GUI, CLI or API can be used to check the status and perform
  operations.
* Supports automatic failover of the master, and the replication tree can
  be fixed when servers in the tree fail - either manually or automatically.
* It is not dependent on any specific version or flavor of MySQL (MySQL,
  Percona Server, MariaDB or even MaxScale binlog servers).
* Orchestrator supports many different types of topologies, from a single
  master -> slave  to complex multi-layered replication trees consisting of
  hundreds of servers.
* Orchestrator can make topology changes and will do so based on the state
  at that moment; it does not require a configuration to be defined with what
  corresponds to the database topology.
* The GUI is not only there to report the status - one of the cooler things
  you can do is change replication just by doing a drag and drop in the web
  interface (of course you can do this and much more through the CLI and API
  as well).
