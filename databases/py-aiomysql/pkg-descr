aiomysql is a "driver" for accessing a MySQL database from the asyncio
(PEP-3156/tulip) framework. It depends on and reuses most parts of PyMySQL .
aiomysql tries to be like awesome aiopg library and preserve same api, look and
feel.

Internally aiomysql is copy of PyMySQL, underlying io calls switched to async,
basically yield from and asyncio.coroutine added in proper places)). sqlalchemy
support ported from aiopg.
