Memcached is a caching daemon designed especially for dynamic web applications
to decrease database load by storing objects in memory. This extension allows
you to work with memcached through handy OO and procedural interfaces.

Note that this port uses unofficial development from
https://github.com/websupport-sk/pecl-memcache (NON_BLOCKING_IO_php7 branch).
