APSW is a Python wrapper for the SQLite embedded relational database
engine. In contrast to other wrappers such as pysqlite it focuses
on being a minimal layer over SQLite attempting just to translate
the complete SQLite API into Python. The documentation has a section
on the differences between APSW and pysqlite. APSW supports CPython
2.3 onwards and CPython 3.1 onwards.
