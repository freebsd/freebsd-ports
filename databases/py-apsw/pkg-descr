APSW provides an SQLite 3 wrapper that provides the thinnest layer over the
SQLite database library possible. Everything you can do from the SQLite C API,
you can do from Python. Although APSW looks vaguely similar to the PEP 249
(DBAPI), it is not compliant with that API because instead it works the way
SQLite 3 does.
