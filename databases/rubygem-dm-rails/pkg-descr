This gem provides the railtie that allows datamapper to hook
into rails3 and thus behave like a rails framework component.
Just like activerecord does in rails, dm-rails uses the railtie
API to hook into rails. The two are actually hooked into rails
almost identically.

Creating new datamapper apps on rails3 from scratch is actually
really easy. The following will guide you through the process.
