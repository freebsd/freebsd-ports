This module allows use of the CQL3 interface of a Cassandra
database. It fully supports asynchronous operation via IO::Async,
allowing both direct queries and prepared statements to be managed
concurrently, if required. Alternatively, as the interface is entirely
based on Future objects, it can be operated synchronously in a
blocking fashion by simply awaiting each individual operation by
calling the get method.
