OctoSQL is predominantly a CLI tool which lets you query a plethora of
databases and file formats using SQL through a unified interface, even do
JOINs between them.

At the same time it's an easily extensible full-blown dataflow engine, and
you can use it to add a SQL interface to your own applications.
