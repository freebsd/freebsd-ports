     RDB is a fast, portable, relational database management system
without arbitrary limits, (other than memory and processor speed) that
runs under, and interacts with, the UNIX Operating system.
     It uses the Operator/Stream DBMS paradigm described in "Unix
Review", March, 1991, page 24, entitled "A 4GL Language".  There are a
number of "operators" that each perform a unique function on the data.
The "stream" is suplied by the UNIX Input/Output redirection mechanism.
Therefore each operator processes some data and then passes it along to
the next operator via the UNIX pipe function. This is very efficient as
UNIX pipes are implemented in memory (at least in versions of UNIX at
RAND).	RDB is compliant with the "Relational Model".
     The data is contained in regular UNIX ACSII files, and so can be
manipulated by regular UNIX utilities, e.g. ls, wc, mv, cp, cat, more,
less, editors like the RAND editor 'e', head, RCS, etc.
