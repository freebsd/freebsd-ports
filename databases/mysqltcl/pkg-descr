From the package man-page:

       MySQLTcl  is a collection of Tcl commands and a Tcl global
       array that provide access to one or  more  mysql  database
       servers.

       MySQLTcl  is  nothing  more  than  a  patched version of a
       patched  version  of  Hakan  Soderstrom's  patch  of   Tom
       Poindexter's  Sybtcl.  Most of the documentention has been
       left as it was when I started to work with this  interface
       (a  patch  of  msqltcl-1.50).  However,  I  have  tried to
       replace appropriate occurrences of msql by MySQL.

This port makes  use of some of  the Tcl-8.x niceties, but  more on that
front can be done.
