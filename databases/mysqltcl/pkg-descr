From the package man-page:

       MySQLTcl  is  a  collection of Tcl commands and a Tcl global array that
       provide access to MySQL database servers.

       MySQLTcl is nothing more than a patched version of a patched version of
       Hakan Soderstrom's patch of Tom Poindexter's Sybtcl.

       Mysqltcl  is  binary Tcl library (extension) written in C language that
       use direkt official MySQL C-API. Almost all Tcl commands correspond  to
       MySQL  C-API functions.  For detail documentation see official MySQL C-
       API manual.
