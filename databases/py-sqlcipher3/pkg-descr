SQLCipher is a standalone fork of the SQLite database library that adds 256 bit
AES encryption of database files and other security features like:
* on-the-fly encryption
* tamper detection
* memory sanitization
* strong key derivation

SQLCipher is based on SQLite and stable upstream release features are
periodically integrated. While SQLCipher is maintained as a separate version of
the source tree, the project minimizes alterations to core SQLite code whenever
possible.

SQLCipher is maintained by Zetetic, LLC, and additional information and
documentation is available on the official SQLCipher site.
