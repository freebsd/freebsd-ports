libmemcached is a C and C++ client library to the memcached server
(http://danga.com/memcached). It has been designed to be light on memory usage,
thread safe, and provide full access to server side methods.

A few notes on its design:

# Synchronous and Asynchronous support.
# TCP and Unix Socket protocols.
# A half dozen or so different hash algorithms.
# Implementations of the new cas, replace, and append operators.
# Man pages written up on entire API.
# Implements both modulo and consistent hashing solutions.

It also implements several command line tools:

memcat - Copy the value of a key to standard output
memflush - Flush the contents of your servers.
memrm - Remove a key(s) from the serrver.
memcp - Copy files to a memached server.
memstat - Dump the stats of your servers to standard output
memslap - Generate testing loads on a memcached cluster
