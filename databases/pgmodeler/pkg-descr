pgModeler - PostgreSQL Database Modeler - is an open source data modeling tool
 designed for PostgreSQL. No more DDL commands written by hand let pgModeler 
do the job for you! This software reunites the concepts of entity-relationship 
diagrams and the features that PostgreSQL implements as extensions of
 SQL standards.
