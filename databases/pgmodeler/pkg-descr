pgModeler - PostgreSQL Database Modeler - is an open source data modeling
tool designed for PostgreSQL. No more DDL commands written by hand: let
pgModeler do the job for you! This software reunites the concepts of
entity-relationship diagrams and the features that PostgreSQL implements as
extensions of SQL standards.
