This module implements an OO-interface to database schemas.  Using this module,
you can create a database schema with an OO Perl interface.  You can read the
schema from an existing database.  You can save the schema to disk and restore
it in a different process.  Most importantly, DBIx::DBSchema can write SQL
CREATE statements for different databases from a single source.
