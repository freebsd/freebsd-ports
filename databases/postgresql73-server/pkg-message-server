For procedural languages and postgresql functions, please note that
you might have to update them when updating the server. For example,
the "elog" method disappeared in postgresql-7.4, so postgresql-contrib
must be updated along with the server.

If you have many tables and many clients running, consider raising
kern.maxfiles using sysctl(8), or reconfigure your kernel
appropriately.

You should vacuum and backup your database regularly. There is a
periodic script, /usr/local/etc/periodic/daily/502.pgsql, that you may
find useful. See the script for instructions.

To allow many simultaneous connections to your PostgreSQL server, you
should raise the SystemV shared memory limits in your kernel. Here are
example values for allowing up to 180 clients (configurations in
postgresql.conf also needed, of course):
  options         SYSVSHM
  options         SYSVSEM
  options         SYSVMSG
  options         SHMMAXPGS=65536
  options         SEMMNI=40
  options         SEMMNS=240
  options         SEMUME=40
  options         SEMMNU=120

If you plan to access your PostgreSQL server using ODBC, please
consider running the SQL script /usr/local/share/postgresql/odbc.sql
to get the functions required for ODBC compliance.

======================================================================

To initialize the database, run

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/010.pgsql.sh initdb

You can then start PostgreSQL by running:

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/010.pgsql.sh start

For postmaster settings, see ~pgsql/data/postgresql.conf

NB. FreeBSD's PostgreSQL port now by default logs to syslog
    See ~pgsql/data/postgresql.conf for more info

======================================================================

To run PostgreSQL at startup, add
'postgresql_enable="YES"' to /etc/rc.conf
