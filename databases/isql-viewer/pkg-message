=============================================================================
This port of iSQL-Viewer is configured to automatically detect and use
the installed JDBC drivers for MySQL and PostgreSQL.

You can add additional JDBC drivers (and dependent JAR files) on a per
service basis in the tabbed dialog "Resources" which resides inside the
"Service Manager" dialog.

However, please note that adding JAR files or directories in the preferences
dialog doesn't have the desired effect in this version.
