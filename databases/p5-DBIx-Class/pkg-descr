This is a sql to oop mapper, inspired by the Class::DBI framework, and
meant to support compability with it, while restructuring the insides,
and making it possible to support some new features like self-joins,
distinct, group bys and more.

This project is still at an early stage so the maintainers don't make
any absolute promise that full backwards-compatibility will be
supported; however if we can without compromising the improvements we're
trying to make, we will, and any non-compatible changes will merit a
full justification on the mailing list and a CPAN developer release for
people to test against.
