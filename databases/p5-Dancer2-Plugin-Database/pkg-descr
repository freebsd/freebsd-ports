Dancer2::Plugin::Database provides an easy way to obtain a connected
DBI database handle by simply calling the database keyword
within your Dancer2 application.

Returns a Dancer2::Plugin::Database::Handle object, which is a
subclass of DBI's DBI::db connection handle object, so it does
everything you'd expect to do with DBI, but also adds a few convenience
methods. See the documentation for Dancer2::Plugin::Database::Handle
for full details of those.
