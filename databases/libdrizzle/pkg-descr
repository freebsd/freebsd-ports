This is the the client and protocol library for the Drizzle project.
The server, drizzled, will use this as for protocol library. Client
utilities and any new projects that require low-level protocol
communication (like proxies). Other language interfaces (PHP
extensions, Python DBI, Perl DBD, SWIG, ...) should be built off
of this library.
