SQL is code. Write it, version control it, comment it, and run it using files.
Writing your SQL code in Python programs as strings doesn't allow you to easily
reuse them in SQL GUIs or CLI tools like psql. With aiosql you can organize
your SQL statements in .sql files, load them into your python application as
methods to call without losing the ability to use them as you would any other
SQL file.
