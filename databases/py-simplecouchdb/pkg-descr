py-simplecouchdb is a simple library to allow your python
application to use CouchDB.

With simplecouchdb, you can manage documents like you do
directly with CouchDB, schema-free. So document instance
(see :ref:schema-ref) are completely dynamic, you could
add/delete properties in your documents, retrieve them
without any schema, etc.
