EmacSQL is a high-level Emacs Lisp front-end for SQLite (primarily),
PostgreSQL, MySQL, and potentially other SQL databases.

It works by maintaining a inferior process running (a "connection")
for interacting with the back-end database. Connections are
automatically cleaned up if they are garbage collected. All requests
are synchronous.

Any readable lisp value can be stored as a value in EmacSQL, including
numbers, strings, symbols, lists, vectors, and closures. EmacSQL has
no concept of "TEXT" values; it's all just lisp objects. The lisp
object nil corresponds 1:1 with NULL in the database.
