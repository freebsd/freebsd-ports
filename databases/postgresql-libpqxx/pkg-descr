Welcome to libpqxx, the official C++ API to the PostgreSQL database
management system.

There are many similar libraries for PostgreSQL and for other
databases, some of them database-independent.  Most of these, however,
are fairly C-like in their programming style, and fail to take
advantage of the full power of the C++ language as it has matured
since the acceptance of the Standard in 1996.  What libpqxx brings you
is effective use of templates to reduce the inconvenience of dealing
with type conversions; of standard C++ strings to keep you from having
to worry about buffer allocation and overflow attacks; of exceptions
to take the tedious and error-prone plumbing around error handling out
of your hands; of constructors and destructors to bring resource
management under control; and even basic object-orientation to give
you some extra reliability features that would be hard to get with
most other database interfaces.
