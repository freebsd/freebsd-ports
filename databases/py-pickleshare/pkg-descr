PickleShare - a small 'shelve' like datastore with concurrency support

Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary.
Unlike shelve, many processes can access the database simultaneously.
Changing a value in database is immediately visible to other processes
accessing the same database.
