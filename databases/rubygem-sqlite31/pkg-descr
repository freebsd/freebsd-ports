sqlite3-ruby provides an interface for the SQLite DB engine version 3.
This differs from the DBD::SQLite module in that it is more complete,
and from the ruby DBI version of SQLite in that it is SQLite specific,
so you can do things that would otherwise be more difficult via DBI.
If you want portability between backends, use DBI.  If you want ease
of use with SQLite, use this.
