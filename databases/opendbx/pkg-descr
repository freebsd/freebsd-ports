OpenDBX is an extremely lightweight but extensible C library for
accessing databases with a single API. It provides a clean and simple
interface across all supported databases that leads to an elegant
code design automatically. Currently MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
(v2 & 3), MSSQL and Sybase are supported and backends for more native
database APIs can be written easily. If you want your application to
support different databases with little effort, this is definitively
the right thing for you!
