This Python library contains a collection of objects for common network
automation tasks.

It intends to keep the following tenets:

* Must not be any dependencies required to run the library.
* May be some optional dependencies, to be managed by the user
  in opt in fashion.
* Shall prefer functions over classes.
* Shall prefer a folder and file structure that is flat.
* Shall leverage docstrings as the primary documentation mechanism.
* Must provide examples in every public function.
* Shall retain a high test coverage.
