Spine, formerly Cactid, is a poller for Cacti that primarily strives to be as
fast as possible. For this reason it is written in native C, makes use of POSIX
threads, and is linked directly against the net-snmp library for minmumal SNMP
polling overhead. Spine is a replacement for the default cmd.php poller so you
must decide if using Spine makes sense for your installation.
