super_mediator is an IPFIX mediator designed to split IPFIX sensing flows
and distribute the network telemetry information to multiple sources.  It
can export the network telemetry data gathered into formats designed for
bulk loading into databases (e.g.  MySQL) or as JSON outputs, as well as
directly loading MySQL tables.  super_mediator is primarily designed to get
network telemetry data from YAF.
