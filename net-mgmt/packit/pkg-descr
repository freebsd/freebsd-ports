Packit is a network auditing and packet crafting tool designed for
testing and analysis of TCP/IP networks. It allows users to customize,
inject, monitor, and manipulate IP traffic by defining nearly all TCP,
UDP, ICMP, IP, ARP, RARP, and Ethernet header fields.

Packit can be used to test firewalls, intrusion detection systems, port
scanning techniques, and to simulate network traffic patterns.  It is
also useful as an educational tool for learning low level network
protocols and packet structures.

This version is a refactored and modernized implementation, updated to
work with current libraries, toolchains, and compiler versions.
