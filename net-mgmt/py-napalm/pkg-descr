NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with
Multivendor support) is a Python library that implements a set of functions to
interact with different router vendor devices using a unified API.

NAPALM supports several methods to connect to the devices, to manipulate
configurations or to retrieve data.
