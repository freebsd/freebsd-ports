Generic TTS implements Icinga Web 2's ticket hook for replacing ticket patterns
with links to your trouble ticket system (TTS). Icinga Web 2's core module
monitoring for example uses the ticket hook for acknowledgements, downtimes and
comments. Other modules may use the ticket hook for all kinds of text too.
