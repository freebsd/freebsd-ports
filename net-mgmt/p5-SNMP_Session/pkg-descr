This archive contains Perl 5 modules SNMP_Session.pm and BER.pm,
which, when used together, provide rudimentary access to remote SNMP
(v1 and v2) agents.

This module differs from existing SNMP packages in that it is
completely stand-alone, i.e. you don't need to have another SNMP
package such as CMU SNMP.  It is also written entirely in Perl, so you
don't have to compile any C modules.  It uses the Perl 5 Socket.pm
module and should therefore be very portable, even to non-Unix systems.

The SNMP operations currently supported are "get", "get-next", "get-bulk"
and "set", as well as trap generation and reception.
