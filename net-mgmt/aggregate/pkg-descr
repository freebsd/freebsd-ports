Takes a list of prefixes in conventional format on stdin,
and performs two optimisations to attempt to reduce the
length of the prefix list.

The first optimisation is to remove any supplied prefixes
which are supurfluous because they are already included in
another supplied prefix. For example, 203.97.2.0/24 would
be removed if 203.97.0.0/17 was also supplied.

The second optimisation identifies adjacent prefixes that
can be combined under a single, shorter-length prefix. For
example, 203.97.2.0/24 and 203.97.3.0/24 can be combined
into the single prefix 203.97.2.0/23.
