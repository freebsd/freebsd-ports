Seafile is an open source cloud storage system with features on privacy
protection and teamwork. Collections of files are called libraries, and
each library can be synced separately. A library can also be encrypted
with a user chosen password. Seafile also allows users to create groups
and easily sharing files into groups.

This is the core component of Seafile server. It provides RPC to the web
front-end (Seahub) to access files, and provides HTTP APIs to the desktop
clients for syncing files.
