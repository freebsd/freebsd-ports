FlowViewer, FlowGrapher, and now FlowTracker are tools that provide an easy
web-based user interface for selecting, viewing, graphing, and now tracking
NetFlow data stored using Mark Fullmer's flow-tools software.

The user is able to filter data (inclusion or exclusion) by device, IP address
range, port, router interface, autonomous system (AS), specified time interval,
and now by protocols, TOS field, and TCP flags. Many of the flow-tools reports
are configured as drop-down selections. Users are also able to save reports and
graphs for later viewing.
