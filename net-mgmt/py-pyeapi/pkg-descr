The Python library for Arista's eAPI command API implementation provides a
client API work using eAPI and communicating with EOS nodes.  The Python
library can be used to communicate with EOS either locally (on-box) or remotely
(off-box).  It uses a standard INI-style configuration file to specify one or
more nodes and connection properties.

The pyeapi library also provides an API layer for building native Python
objects to interact with the destination nodes. The API layer is a convenient
implementation for working with the EOS configuration and is extensible for
developing custom implementations.
