Netdisco is a web-based network management tool
designed for network administrators.
Data is collected into a PostgreSQL database using SNMP.

Some of the things you can do with Netdisco:
  Locate a machine on the network by MAC or IP
      and show the switch port it lives at
  Turn off a switch port, or change the VLAN or PoE status of a port
  Inventory your network hardware by model, vendor, software
      and operating system
  Pretty pictures of your network

App::Netdisco provides a web frontend with built-in web server,
and a backend daemon to handle interactive requests
such as changing port or device properties.
