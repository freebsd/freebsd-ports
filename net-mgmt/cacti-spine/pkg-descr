Spine is a poller for Cacti that primarily strives to be as fast as
possible. For this reason it is written in native C, makes use of POSIX
threads, and is linked directly against the net-snmp library for
minimal SNMP polling overhead.

It's a replacement for the default 'poller.php' script, so you must
decide if using Spine makes sense for your installation.
