You can mostly follow the guide at:
http://docs.librenms.org/

with the following notes:
- Installation directory is %%WWWDIR%%

NOTE: setting sql-mode="" is no longer required. You can remove it from
%%LOCALBASE%%/etc/mysql/my.cnf

LibreNMS requires specific entries in my.cnf for MySQL. In MySQL 8, once the
service is started for the first time, the lower_case_table_names value can not
be changed. It is recommended that you my.cnf before starting MySQL for the
first time or pass specific values on the command-line when starting MySQL. 

NOTE that the lower_case_table_names entry needs to be set before you start
MySQL for the first time.

innodb_file_per_table=1
lower_case_table_names=0

By default MySQL 8 uses a different authentication plugin to auth database users.
If you see errors in the logs like this:

"The server requested authentication method unknown to the client..."

Add this to my.cnf:

[mysqld]
default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password

The following MySQL configuration is required. Adjust 'localhost' as
required if MySQL is on a different host.

CREATE DATABASE librenms CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'librenms'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED with mysql_native_password BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON librenms.* TO 'librenms'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Enable the poller service with this command:

sysrc librenms_enable="YES"

The service will log to /var/log/librems/librenms-service.log

For log file rotation

* sample file installed to %%WWWDIR%%/contrib/newsyslog.conf.sample
* actual file installed, never overwriting, to %%PREFIX%%/etc/newsyslog.conf.d/librenms.conf

For new installs, you need a %%WWWDIR%%/.env file. To create:

cd %%WWWDIR%%
cp -i .env.example .env

That file will eventually contain secrets.  Make sure it is not world-readable.

Database connection details are required in that file.

When trying to run /install for the first time you need to have (INSTALL=true)
in your .env file. If you don't set it you will get a 403 error on the
webpage.

Then run:

sudo php artisan key:generate

It should write directly to your .env file. The output should look something
like this:

$ sudo php artisan key:generate
Application key set successfully.

You need an APP_KEY.

* %%WWWDIR%%/.env should now contain:
  * APP_KEY
  * NODE_I
  * DB_HOST
  * DB_DATABASE
  * DB_USERNAME
  * DB_PASSWORD

* you can create a NODE_ID with: php -r 'echo uniqid() . "\n";'

After that, follow the LibreNMS documentation for configuration.

It is also a good idea to validate your configuation after MySQL has been
started:

cd %%WWWDIR%%
sudo ./validate.php

EOM
}
{ type: upgrade
  message: <<EOM
Depending on the version, you may have to run the upgrade script.

cd %%WWWDIR%%
./build-base.php

Or the database upgrade script:

./lnms migrate

NOTE: that script is particular about who runs it and ownership.
You might have to chown www first, then:

chown www lnms
su -fm www
./lnms migrate
exit
chown root lnms


re: https://docs.librenms.org/General/Updating/

LibreNMS requires specific entries in my.cnf for MySQL.

NOTE that the lower_case_table_names entry needs to be set before you start
MySQL for the first time.

innodb_file_per_table=1
lower_case_table_names=0

For MySQL 8, you need to update the my.cnf

And adjust the login (adjusting localhost as required):

alter user 'librenms'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password by 'passwordhere';

NOTE: Starting with the 22.2.1 port the %%%WWWDIR%%/storage directory has
been replaced with a symlink to /var/db/librenms/storage
