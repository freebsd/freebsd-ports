=======================================================================
Nagiosql is now installed. If you install it for the first time,
you may have to add an alias in apache config for it.

Alias /nagiosql/ "%%WWWDIR%%/"

You will also need to enable the installer by creating a file
ENABLE_INSTALLER in the install dir

# touch %%WWWDIR%%/install/ENABLE_INSTALLER
