Promxy is a prometheus proxy that makes many shards of prometheus appear as
a single API endpoint to the user. This significantly simplifies operations
and use of prometheus at scale (when you have more than one prometheus host).
Promxy delivers this unified access endpoint without requiring any sidecars,
custom-builds, or other changes to your prometheus infrastructure.
