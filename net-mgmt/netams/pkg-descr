NeTAMS - Network Traffic Accounting and Monitoring Software.
It is built for UNIX and works for networks with Cisco routers or PC Unix
routers (Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris). Several methods of traffic gathering are
supported (tee/divert/ip_queue/libpcap/netflow v5), database storage
(BerkleyDB/MySQL/PostgresSQL), aggregation, visualization, notification etc.
It is possible to block traffic based on quotas, authorization ID, empty
balance (billing); manage bandwidth, create a flexible accounting and
filtration policies.
