NOCOL/NetConsole (Network Operation Center On-Line) is a network monitoring 
package that runs on Unix platforms and is capable of monitoring network and
system variables such as ICMP or RPC reachability, RMON variables,
nameservers, ethernet load, port reachability, host performance, SNMP traps,
modem line usage, appletalk & novell routes/services, BGP peers, syslog
files, etc. The software is extensible and new monitors can be added easily.
