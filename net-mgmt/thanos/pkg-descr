Thanos is a set of components that can be composed into a highly available
metric system with unlimited storage capacity, which can be added seamlessly
on top of existing Prometheus deployments.

Thanos leverages the Prometheus 2.0 storage format to cost-efficiently store
historical metric data in any object storage while retaining fast query
latencies.

Additionally, it provides a global query view across all Prometheus
installations and can merge data from Prometheus HA pairs on the fly.

Features:

- Global querying view across all connected Prometheus servers
- Deduplication and merging of metrics collected from Prometheus HA pairs
- Seamless integration with existing Prometheus setups
- Any object storage as its only, optional dependency
- Downsampling historical data for massive query speedup
- Cross-cluster federation
- Fault-tolerant query routing
- Simple gRPC "Store API" for unified data access across all metric data
- Easy integration points for custom metric providers
