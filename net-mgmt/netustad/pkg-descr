To ease the task of network administration,
decrease the likelihood of erronous command execution and
to maintain all network services from a central point,
EnderUNIX SDT anounces the availability of its 9th open-source tool, 
netUstad.

It has been coded in C language and includes its own HTTP server.
The newly anounced version provides a web interface for
system administrators to add/delete/update FreeBSD IPFW and Linux IpTables 
rulesets, manage routing table and network interfaces.

You can manage your Firewall via a TCP/IP connected remote PC, easily.
