SNMP::Info gives an object oriented interface to information
obtained through SNMP. This module is geared towards network devices.
Subclasses exist for a number of network devices and common MIBs.
The information may be coming from any number of MIB files and is very
vendor specific. SNMP::Info provides you a common method for all
supported devices.
Adding support for your own device is easy, and takes little much SNMP
knowledge.
The module is not limited to network devices. Any MIB or device can be
given an objected oriented front-end by making a module that consists of a
couple hashes. See EXTENDING SNMP::INFO.
