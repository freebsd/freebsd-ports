bgpuma is a program for searching BGP update files created by MRT
or Zebra/Quagga for CIDR blocks and/or Autonomous Systems.  Given
a list of CIDR blocks, it looks for those CIDR blocks which match
the list, are contained in the list, or are contained by the list.
For Autonomous Systems, it looks for routes that are announced by
the given system.

It is based on the library created by RIPE called bgpdump and SiLK,
created by CERT.
