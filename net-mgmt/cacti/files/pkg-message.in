=======================================================================
Cacti is now installed. If you install it for the first time,
you may have to follow this steps to make it work correctly:

1. Create the MySQL database, a cacti user, and initialize:
   a) CREATE DATABASE `cacti`;
   b) Create a mysql user/password for cacti:
      CREATE USER 'cacti'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   c) Add GRANTS:
      GRANT ALL ON `cacti`.* TO 'cacti'@'localhost';
      GRANT SELECT ON `mysql`.`time_zone_name` TO 'cacti'@'localhost';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   d) Import the default cacti database:
      mysql --database=cacti -ucacti -p < %%PREFIX%%/%%CACTIDIR%%/cacti.sql

   If you haven't already imported your MySQL timezone data, you need to do this:
      mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root -p mysql

 NOTE:
   * Cacti does not LOCK TABLES.

2. Edit %%PREFIX%%/%%CACTIDIR%%/include/config.php from the template
   config.php.orig.

   PHP requires the time zone to be explicitly set rather that rely on
   the system time zone, otherwise poller complains. I added the
   following line to my config.php:

   date_default_timezone_set('America/Los_Angeles');

3. Add the following line to cron for %%CACTIUSER%%:
*/5 * * * * %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/php %%PREFIX%%/%%CACTIDIR%%/poller.php > /dev/null 2>&1

4. Example Apache 2.4 configuration:
   (This assumes that you have installed a working PHP Apache install, e.g. with mod_php)


   <FilesMatch "\.php$">
       SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
   </FilesMatch>
   <FilesMatch "\.phps$">
       SetHandler application/x-httpd-php-source
   </FilesMatch>

   DirectoryIndex index.php

   DocumentRoot "/usr/local/share/cacti"

   Alias /cacti "/usr/local/share/cacti/"
   Alias /Cacti "/usr/local/share/cacti/"

   <Directory "/usr/local/share/cacti">
      Require all granted
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

5. Open a Cacti login page in your web browser and follow the install instructions.


If you update cacti, open a login page and an updating process will
start automatically.

NOTEs as of 10Aug2014:

1) Cacti now better supports hier(7)

   a) Cacti log files are now found under /var/log/cacti where you can
      manage them using newsyslog.
   b) Cacti RRD files are now found under /var/db/cacti/rra.

   If you have an existing Cacti installation these paths are also
   found in Cacti's SQL database and MUST be updated. These two SQL
   commands should do the trick:

   UPDATE settings SET value='/var/log/cacti/log' \
     WHERE name='path_cactilog';

   UPDATE poller_item SET rrd_path=\
     REPLACE(rrd_path,'/usr/local/share/cacti/rra','/var/db/cacti/rra') \
     WHERE rrd_path REGEXP '^/usr/local/share/cacti/rra';

2) The PERL paths in the Cacti PERL scripts have been updated to
   /usr/local/bin.

Other Erratas:
   1) Mount linprocfs in /compat/linux/proc will allow most scripts to work.
   2) This package does not install a MySQL server in case you wish to use an
      external MySQL server.  Install a package such as mysql57-server if you
      require a local server.
