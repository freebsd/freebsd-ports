This tool is capable of managing sets of IPs.

 Why to use iprange over any other aggregate ?
  * simpler
  * supports many input formats, all together in the same file
  * faster, actually a lot faster (thanks to the original design
    by Gabriel Somlo)
  * can compare files with IPs to find if they overlap and to what degree
  * can find the IPs common to a set of files
  * can exclude IPs (merge a set of files while excluding all IPs matched
    by another set of files)
