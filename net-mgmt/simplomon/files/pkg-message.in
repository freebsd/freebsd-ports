Note this is a port of alpha-grade software. In local testing it has shown
to be solid already, but not all functionality works as expected on
FreeBSD yet, or may not work correctly at all. The port comes with an rc
daemon, expecting a config file in %%ETCDIR%%/simplomon.conf .
See the README.md for detailed configuration and setup.

Please report any issues on the upstream PR:

    https://github.com/berthubert/simplomon/pull/58
