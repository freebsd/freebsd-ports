check_multi is kind of a wrapper plugin which takes benefit of the
Nagios 3.x capability to display multiple lines of plugin output.
It calls multiple child plugins and displays their output in the
long_plugin_output. A summary is given in the standard plugin output.

Normally the child return code with the highest severity becomes the
parent (check_multi) plugin return code. But you can influence this
by specifying flexible state evaluation rules.

The configuration is very simple: a NRPE-stylish config file contains
a tag for each child plugin and then the check command line.

check_multi can cover complex Business Process Views - using a builtin
state evaluation mechanism. The second benefit is cluster monitoring
with no need for extra services. All you need is provided by check_multi.
