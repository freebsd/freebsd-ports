NFDUMP tools support netflow v5 and v7 capturing and processing.

nfcapd - netflow capture daemon.
Reads the netflow data from the network and stores the data into files.

nfdump - netflow dump.
Reads the netflow data from the files stored by nfcapd. It's syntax is similar
to tcpdump. If you like tcpdump you will like nfdump. 

nfprofile - netflow profiler.
Reads the netflow data from the files stored by nfcapd. Filters the netflow 
data according to the specified filter sets ( profiles ) and stores the
filtered data into files for later use.

nfreplay - netflow replay
Reads the netflow data from the files stored by nfcapd and sends it over 
the network to another host.
