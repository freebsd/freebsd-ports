In contrast to Linux it is not necessary to use airmon-ng to enable the monitor
mode of your wireless card. So do not care about what the manpages say about
airmon-ng. airodump-ng sets monitor mode automatically.
To return from monitor mode use:
ifconfig ${INTERFACE} -mediaopt monitor

For aireplay-ng you need FreeBSD >= 7.0
