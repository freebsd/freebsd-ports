aircrack is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can 
recover this keys once enough encrypted packets have been captured. 
It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations 
like KoreK attacks, thus making the attack much faster compared to 
other WEP cracking tools. In fact aircrack is a set of tools for 
auditing wireless networks.
