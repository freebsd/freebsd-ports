Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can
recover keys once enough data packets have been captured.  It implements the
standard FMS attack along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, as
well as the all-new PTW attack, thus making the attack much faster compared
to other WEP cracking tools.  In fact, Aircrack-ng is a set of tools for
auditing wireless networks.
