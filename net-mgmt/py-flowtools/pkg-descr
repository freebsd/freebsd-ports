py-flowtools extension module gives you a simple python interface
to NetFlow data as stored by Mark Fullmer's flow-tools package.

It contains a class FlowSet which reads the data from a given file
(or from standard input). A FlowSet provides an iterator interface
to access the individual flow records as instances of a second
class called Flow. A Flow provides access to its data through
attribute references.
