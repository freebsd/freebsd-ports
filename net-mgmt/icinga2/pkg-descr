Icinga 2 is a network monitoring system and parallel development branch to
Icinga 1.
Written from scratch, it builds on the success of Icinga 1 and deals with
shortcomings inherited from Nagios as a fork.

Icinga 2 is:
- Easy to install with soft link activation of functions and packages
- Multithreaded and very fast: Capable of thousands of checks per second
- Intuitive to configure, using new object-based, template-driven format
- Easy to extend with native support for Livestatus and Graphite
- Cluster-enabled for distributed monitoring out of the box
