IP Stack Integrity Checker

Its purpose is to test the stability of an IP Stack and its component stacks
(TCP, UDP, ICMP et. al.) It does this be generating random packets of the
desired protocol. The packets can have tendencies. ie by default all packets
have a 50% chance of having IP Options. The packets are then sent against the
target machine to either penetrate its firewall rules or find bugs in the IP
stack.
