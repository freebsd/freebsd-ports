The NSCA-ng package provides a client-server pair which makes the Nagios
command file accessible to remote systems. This allows for submitting passive
check results, downtimes, and many other commands to Nagios or compatible
monitoring solutions. The submitted data is queued by the NSCA?ng server if
Nagios goes down. Multiple check results or commands can be submitted in one
go, and multiline plugin output is fully supported.
