PNP is an addon to nagios which analyzes performance data provided
by plugins and stores them automatically into RRD-databases (Round
Robin Databases, see RRD Tool).

During development of PNP we set value on easy installation and
little maintenance while running it. An administrator should do
other things than configure graphing tools.
