Pancho was written with the goal of allowing network
administrators make a change to a group of Cisco routers
without being required to log into each host.

Pancho also provides the flexibility to allow admins to
use its function against a single host, a select group
or the entire whole. In addition to changes to current
configurations on remote routers, pancho is also capable
of archiving router configurations manually or through
automated runs.

Support is provided for Cisco, Foundry, Nortel/Alteon,
Avaya, or Dell PowerConnect devices.
