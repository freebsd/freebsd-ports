For an existing config, or creating a new one, fix the UID/GID.
Do not change %%PREFIX%%/%%SEAFILE_SERVER%% unless your front
end is using the seafile UID/GID as well.

chown -R seafile:seafile %%PREFIX%%/%%HAIWENDIR%%/conf \
	%%PREFIX%%/%%HAIWENDIR%%/ccnet %%PREFIX%%/%%HAIWENDIR%%/seafile-data \
	%%PREFIX%%/%%HAIWENDIR%%/pids %%PREFIX%%/%%HAIWENDIR%%/logs

Don't forget to run update scripts after every minor and major update located in
	%%PREFIX%%/%%SEAFILE_SERVER%%/upgrade

Patch updates (5.1.x) don't require these scripts, however do required a restarted.
