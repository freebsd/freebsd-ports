A Qt wrapper for NetworkManager DBus API.

NetworkManagerQt provides access to all NetworkManager features exposed on
DBus. It allows you to manage your connections and control your network
devices and also provides a library for parsing connection settings which are
used in DBus communication.

This port serves as a dud to bypass Linux dependencies for other ports.
