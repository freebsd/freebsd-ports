yapsnmp is a Python SNMP module based on the net-snmp library. It's composed
of a low level interface to the library, created using SWIG, and a higher
level python module removing all the complexity out of dealing with SNMP.

* Full MIB parsing, enabling you to use named OIDs as well as the numeric
  representations;
* Support for SNMP version 1 and 2c (with 3 coming);
* Supports GET, GETNEXT, GETBULK, SET and TRAPv2 (INFORM to come), as well
  as convenient "walk" and "table extraction" functions;
* Uses the Single Session API and appropriate Python interpreter releases,
  rendering the module thread safe;
* Offers a very high level interface, allowing easy SNMP integration into
  your code.
