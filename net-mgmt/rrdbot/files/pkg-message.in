Post-Installation Procedure
===========================
Before starting the rrdbot daemon for the first time, you need to
perform some necessary steps:

1. Create configuration file(s) of what you wish to monitor, and
   and place them in %%PREFIX%%/etc/rrdbot
2. Create the RRD files based on the above configuration file(s),
   using %%PREFIX%%/sbin/rrdbot-create

When creating your rrdbot configuration files which use the "archive"
feature, be sure your archive durations are correct mathematically
when compared to the actual SNMP polling interval.  For example,
assuming your SNMP polling interval is 30:

  6/minute -- won't work (6*30 = 180 seconds)
  2/minute -- will work  (2*30 = 60 seconds)

Otherwise you'll receive this kind of warning when using rrdbot-create:

  rrdbot-create: my.conf: archive has too many data points for polling interval. ignoring

Once you've followed these steps, you can start the daemon by setting
rrdbot_enable="yes" in rc.conf, and then execute:

  %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/rrdbot start

If you forgot to run rrdbot-create, rrdbotd will start but will silently
fail when trying to write data to the non-existent RRD.  So please be
sure to follow the above!
