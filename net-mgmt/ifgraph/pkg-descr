ifGraph is a set of Perl scripts created to help network administrators
to visualize network flow on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis.
The graphics are created with RRDTool, and it shows bytes (in/out) and
errors for each interface. It also shows the current/average/max use and
the respective link/interface usage in percentages. The program also
outputs HTML files to make the visualization of the PNG/GIF/GD images
more friendly and easy.
