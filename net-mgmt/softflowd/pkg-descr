Softflowd is flow-based network traffic analyzer capable of Cisco NetFlow
data export.  Softflowd semi-statefully tracks traffic flows recorded by
listening on a network interface or by reading a packet capture file.
These flows may be reported via NetFlow to a collecting host or summarized
within softflowd itself.
