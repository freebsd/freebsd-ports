NetSPoC is a tool for security managment of large computer networks with
different security domains. It generates configuration files for packet
filters controlling the borders of security domains.

NetSPoC provides its own language for describing security policy and topology
of a network. The security policy is a set of rules that state which packets
are allowed to pass the network and which not. NetSPoC is topology aware: a
rule for traffic from A to B is automatically applied to all managed packet
filters on the path from A to B.

Currently NetSPoC generates ACLs and static routing entries for Cisco routers
and PIX firewalls. Support for network address translation and IPSec has not
been implemented yet.
