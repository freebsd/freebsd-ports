Nagios/Icinga/Sensu plugin to check current server's RAID status

This plugin checks all RAID volumes (hardware and software) that can be
identified.

While written originally for Nagios, it's known to work also with:

* Icinga
* Sensu

This is supposed to be a general plugin to run via NRPE. It checks for the
various RAID systems, and verifies they are working correctly.

Some checks require root permission, that is acomplished using sudo.
Neccessary sudo rules (detected for your system), can be installed when
check_raid is invoked with -S argument. You need to be root user and it will add
required lines to the sudo config file. Run with -d to preview the sudo rules
