ncclient is a Python library for NETCONF clients. It aims to offer
an intuitive API that sensibly maps the XML-encoded nature of
NETCONF to Python constructs and idioms, and make writing
network-management scripts easier. Other key features are:

- Supports all operations and capabilities defined in RFC 4741.
- Request pipelining.
- Asynchronous RPC requests.
- Keeping XML out of the way unless really needed.
- Extensible. New transport mappings and capabilities/operations
  can be easily added.
