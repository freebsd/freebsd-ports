Virt Viewer provides a graphical viewer for the guest OS
display. At this time is supports guest OS using the VNC
protocol. Further protocols may be supported in the future
as user demand dictates. The viewer can connect directly
to both local and remotely hosted guest OS, optionally
using SSL/TLS encryption.
