Snap is an open telemetry framework designed to simplify the collection,
processing and publishing of system data through a single API. The goals
of this project are to:

- Empower systems to expose a consistent set of telemetry data
- Simplify telemetry ingestion across ubiquitous storage systems
- Allow flexible processing of telemetry data on agent (e.g. filtering
  and decoration)
- Provide powerful clustered control of telemetry workflows across small
  or large clusters
