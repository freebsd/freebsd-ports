This is an SNMP message encoding and decoding library, providing very
low-level facilities; you pretty much need to read the SNMP RFCs to use
it.  It is, however, very fast (it's more than an order of magnitude
faster than Net::SNMP, and it can send a request and parse a response in
only slightly more time than the snmpd from net-snmp takes to parse the
request and send a response), and it's relatively complete --- the
interface is flexible enough that you can use it to write SNMP
management applications, SNMP agents, and test suites for SNMP
implementations.

The package also includes NSNMP::Simple, which lets you get or set a
single OID via SNMP with a single line of code.  It's easier to use, and
roughly an order of magnitude faster, than Net::SNMP.
