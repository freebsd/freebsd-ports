This package provides a suite of modules for managing NetApp's NAS
devices, commonly referred to as "filers".

This is the first public release of my NetApp Perl API, and although I
consider the code to be very stable, the API should be considered
experimental.  The convention I will be following regarding
non-compatible API changes is as follows.  I'm using a
major.minor.subminor release naming convention, and I will promise to
NOT make non-backwards compatible changes between subminor releases.

However, in order to allow the API to evolve, it is entirely possible
that non-backwards compatible changes will be made between minor
releases.  IOW, the major.minor release numbers can be considered an
API version.  Any changes to 1.1.0, 1.1.2, etc. must be backwards
compatible with the previous 1.1.* releases.

There is no guarantee that 1.2.0 will be 100% backwards compatible,
although such changes will be made only when justified.  The author
does not believe in infinite backwards compatibility.
