This is a PERL interface to the Zenoss Monitoring System
JSON API.  It allows the ability to execute all available functions
provided by the Zenoss API programmatically.  Anything you could do from
the Zenoss interface can be achieved via this module.  This is a
full service implementation, providing the construction of the call
to the API and the handling of the response.
