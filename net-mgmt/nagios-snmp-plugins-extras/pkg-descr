The general idea of these scripts is to check as many things as possible with
SNMP: disks, memory, load, network interfaces, running processes, etc...

The other idea is to select disks, interfaces, process using regular
expressions:

- it is possible to test more than one disk/int/process in one Nagios check
  (ex.: eth* instead of eth0,eth1,eth2,...)

- you only have to provide a unique part of the name to select a
  disk/int/process (ex. : "C:" instead of "C:\ Label: Serial Number xxxxxxx"
  makes it easy to use on multiple Windows hosts).

Most of these scripts can make performance outputs.
