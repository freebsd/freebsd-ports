fusioninventory-agent is an agent for OCS Inventory server and
FusionInventory for GLPI servers. It creates local inventory of the
machines (hardware and software) and send it to the server. It can also
write it in a local XML file. This agent is the successor of the former
linux_agent which was released with OCS 1.01 and prior. It also replaces
the unofficial Solaris/AIX/BSD agents.
