This python module can be used to monitor and control Tesla Energy Powerwalls.
It uses a single class (Powerwall) and simple functions to fetch energy data
and poll API endpoints on the Gateway.

pyPowerwall will cache the authentication headers and API call responses to
help reduce the number of calls made to the Gateway (useful if you are
polling the Powerwall frequently for trending data).

* Works with Tesla Energy Gateways - Powerwall and Powerwall+
* Simple access through easy to use functions using customer credentials
* Will cache authentication to reduce load on Powerwall Gateway
* Will cache responses to limit number of calls to Powerwall Gateway
* Easy access to decoded binary device vitals
* Provides solar string data for Powerwall+ systems
