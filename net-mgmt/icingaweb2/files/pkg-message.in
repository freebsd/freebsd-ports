Sample configuration files for Apache and NGinx have been installed in:
%%EXAMPLESDIR%%

Be sure to enable PHP and rewrite support in your web server.

Now create a configuration token:
cd %%WWWDIR%% && ./bin/icingacli setup token create --config=%%ETCDIR%%

Enter this token on Icinga Web 2's setup interface at
http://localhost/icingaweb2/setup

If you like to create the database schemas manually, you can find the
SQL files at %%WWWDIR%%/etc/schema

Be sure to always read the upgrading instructions and update database schemas
