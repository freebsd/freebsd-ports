hastmon is a monitoring daemon that allows a couple of hosts to run a
service providing automatic failover. Those machines will be called a
cluster and each machine is one cluster node. hastmon is designed for
clusters that work in Primary-Secondary configuration, which means
that only one of the cluster nodes can be active at any given time.
