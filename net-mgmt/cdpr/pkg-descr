cdpr (Cisco Discovery Protocol Reporter) shows the switch and port that 
a machine is connected to, provided that the device supports CDP. It 
can also optionally decode the full CDP packet. cdpr was written to 
help network/system administrators find out about the equipment that i
a machine is connected to. This is done by capturing and decoding a 
Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) packet.
