Would you like to summarize and/or log network activity down to the ip address
and port level of detail, but not record every packet?

Ipaudit provides that ability.

Ipaudit listens to a network device in promiscuous mode, and records of every
'connection', each conversation between two ip addresses. A unique connection
is determined by the ip addresses of the two machines, the protocol used
between them and the port numbers (if they are communicating via udp or tcp).

It uses a hash table to keep track of the number of bytes and packets in both
directions. When ipaudit receives a signal SIGTERM (kill) or SIGINT (kill -2,
usually the same as a Control-C), it stops collecting data and writes the
tabulated results.

Ipaudit is built using the pcap packet capture library to read the network port
from LBNL Network Research Group.
