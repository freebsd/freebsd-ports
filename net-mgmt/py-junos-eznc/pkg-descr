Junos PyEZ is a Python library to remotely manage/automate Junos
devices.

Junos PyEZ is designed to provide the same capabilities as a user
would have on the Junos CLI, but in an environment built for
automation tasks. These capabilities include, but are not limited to:
- Remote connectivity and management of Junos devices via NETCONF
- Provide "facts" about the device such as software-version, serial-number, etc
- Retrieve "operational" or "run-state" information as Tables/Views
- Retrieve configuration information as Tables/Views
- Make configuration changes in unstructured and structured ways
- Provide common utilities for tasks such as secure copy of files and software
