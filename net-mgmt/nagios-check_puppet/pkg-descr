check_puppet - is a very simple Nagios plugin to check Puppet daemon
availability with SNMP.

Why check_puppet?

1. It does check whether puppetd and puppetmasterd is alive.

2. It does check state.yaml freshness

3. It does not require the full net-mgmt/nagios-plugins package on the client
side

4. It is written in sh - code interpreter available in a base system
