Icinga is an enterprise grade open source monitoring system which keeps
watch over networks and any conceivable network resource, notifies the user
of errors and recoveries and generates performance data for reporting.
Scalable and extensible, Icinga can monitor complex, large environments
across dispersed locations.

Icinga is a fork of Nagios and is backward compatible.  That said, Nagios
configurations, plugins, and addons can all be used with Icinga.  Though
Icinga retains all the existing features of its predecessor, it builds on
them to add many long awaited patches and features requested by the user
community.
