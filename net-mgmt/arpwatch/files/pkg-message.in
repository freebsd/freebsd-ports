You can create an ethercodes.dat file by running this script:

    %%PREFIX%%/arpwatch/update-ethercodes

Here's a example crontab entry to update it every night:

    00 0 * * * root sleep `jot -r 1 0 600` ; %%PREFIX%%/arpwatch/update-ethercodes

The -m flag was removed. If you were using the -m watcher flag,
please switch to -w.
