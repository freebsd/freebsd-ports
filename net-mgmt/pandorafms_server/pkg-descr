Pandora FMS is a monitoring Open Source software. It watches your systems and
applications, and allows you to know the status of any element of those systems.

website, a memory leak in one of your server application, or the movement of
any value of the NASDAQ new technology market. Pandora FMS could send out SMS
message when your systems fails... or when Google's value drop below US348.60?

Pandora FMS runs on any operating system, with specific agents for each
platform, gathering data and sending it to a server, it has specific agents for
GNU/Linux, AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, BSD/IPSO, and Windows 2000, XP and 2003.

Pandora FMS can also monitor any kind of TCP/IP service, without the need to
install agents, and monitor network systems such as load balancers, routers,
switches, operating systems, applications, or simply printers if you need.
Pandora FMS also supports SNMP for collecting data and for receiving traps.

A few examples of common resources monitored by Pandora FMS could be processor
load, disk and memory usage, running processes, log files, environmental
factors such as temperature, or application values like strings contained in
web pages or any possible way to collect data in an automatic way.
