Cisco::Reconfig makes it easier to write programs to generate changes to Cisco
configuration files.

Cisco::Reconfig is a module that parses Cisco router configuration files. It doesn't
have any real understanding of Cisco configurations so it might be useful for other
similar configuration languages. It knows that nesting is shown by indentation.
It knows that ! means a comment. It knows that no may proceed a line without
changing where that line exists in the hierarchy. It doesn't know much else.

Cisco::Reconfig can be used to modify configurations. The set() method will check
the current configruation and return commands to change it if it is other than
what is wanted (as passed to the set() method).
