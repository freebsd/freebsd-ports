Cisco::Reconfig makes it easier to write programs to generate changes
to Cisco configuration files.

Cisco::Reconfig is a module that parses Cisco router configuration
files. It doesn't have any real understanding of Cisco configurations
so it might be useful for other similar configuration languages. It
knows that nesting is shown by indentation. It knows that ! means a
comment. It knows that no may proceed a line without changing where
that line exists in the hierarchy. It doesn't know much else.

Cisco::Reconfig can be used to modify configurations. The set() method
will check the current configruation and return commands to change it
if it is other than what is wanted (as passed to the set() method).
