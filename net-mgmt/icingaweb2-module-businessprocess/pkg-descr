If you want to visualize and monitor hierarchical business processes based on
any or all objects monitored by Icinga, the Icinga Web 2 business process
module is the way to go.

Want to create custom process-based dashboards? Trigger notifications at
process or sub-process level? Provide a quick top-level view for thousands of
components on a single screen? That's what this module has been designed for!

You're running a huge cloud, want to get rid of the monitoring noise triggered
by your auto-scaling platform but still want to have detailed information just
a couple of clicks away in case you need them? You will love this little
module!
