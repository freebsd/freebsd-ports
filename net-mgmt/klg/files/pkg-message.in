=======================================================================
KLG is now installed.

If this is the first installation, you need to configure a few things first.

1. Create the MySQL database, a klg user, and initialise:
   a) CREATE DATABASE klg;
   b) CREATE USER 'klg'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
      GRANT ALL ON klg.* TO 'klg'@'localhost';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   c) import the schema:
      mysql -u klg -p klg < %%DATADIR%%/klg_schema.sql

2. Edit %%WWWDIR%%/klg/klg_config.php from the template klg_config.php.sample

   You need to specify the MySQL details from above at the top of the file,
   and details of your routers further down.  Follow the comments in the file.

   You may wish to specify the timezone by adding a line similar to this:

      date_default_timezone_set('Europe/London');

3. Edit %%WWWDIR%%/klg/klg_template.html from the template file to suit your
   needs.  Items in this file are substituted upon execution so you can skin
   your looking glass to your site.

4. Example Apache 2.4 configuration:

   This assumes you have already configured Apache to serve .php documents.

   Alias /klg "%%WWWDIR%%/klg/"

   <Directory "%%WWWDIR%%/klg/">
      Require all granted
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

5. Access your new looking glass:

   http://HOSTNAME/klg/klg.php
