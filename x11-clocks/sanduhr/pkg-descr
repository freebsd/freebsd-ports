SandUhr is an alarm clock, which is designed as a sand-glass. The program uses
the X Window System and the GNOME desktop environment. The alarm is delivered
to you by either ringing the console bell, by playing a sound file, or by
starting an external program of your choice.

The program is fully integrated into the GNOME application framework.

o Drag and drop: you may drop a color onto the timer to change the sand's visual
  appearance.
o It uses the GNOME help system to provide a manual.
o Use of CORBA: The program provides a CORBA interface. So you may control the
  SandUhr from within your own programs.
