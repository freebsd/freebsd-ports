Dclock is a classic, simple, 7-segment X11 clock with some optional
features such as military time and alarm. The original version is
written by Dan Heller. Tim Edwards heavily modified it and released as
version 2.0. This port uses Debian porting as upstream, which is based
on Tim's version and also includes some additional features and fixes.
