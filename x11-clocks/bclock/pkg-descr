This is a mutated version of Oclock, using a bezier curve to
draw the hands.  It has a pretty funny appearance and it's
actually fairly tough to use it to tell the time.

The bezier curve is drawn using 4 control points:
1) the end of the (not visible) hours hand (closest to the center)
2) the center of the clock itself
3) the end of the seconds hand (closest to the border)
4) the end of the minutes hand (slightly closer to the center)
