WMFishTime is a time/date applet for WindowMaker (and BlackBox, E,
SawFish...). Top part has the clock face, bottom part has day of the
week, followed by day, followed by month. Yellow hand counts seconds,
green hand counts minutes, red hand counts hours. Few seconds after
startup there are at least 32 bubbles floating up behind the clock face.
There are 4 fishes randomly swimming back and forth. If you move your
mouse inside the dockapp window, the fish will get scared and run away.
