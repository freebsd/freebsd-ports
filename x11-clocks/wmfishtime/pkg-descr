This is a time/date applet for WindowMaker (and BlackBox, E, SawFish...). Top
part has the clock face, bottom part has day of the week, followed by day,
followed by month. Yellow hand counts seconds, green hand counts minutes, red
hand counts hours. Few seconds after startup there are at least 32 bubbles
floating up behind the clock face.  There are 4 fishes randomly swimming back
and forth. If you move your mouse inside the dockapp window, the fish will get
scared and run away.
